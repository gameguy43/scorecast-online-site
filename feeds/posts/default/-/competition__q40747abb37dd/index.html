But I think it can also have everything to do with success-- success of a project, success of a career, and success in life. We as creative artists sometimes get tunnel vision, or blinders while working. This can be both a benefit and a curse. The energy needed to create something from nothing needs to be tapped in ‘each person’s unique way’.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMore on this after the jump...\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca name\u003d'more'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eUltimately, sound, music, and picture are collaborations between many people on a team. All that matters are the results, not necessarily the methods, or the equipment. Do clients REALLY care what version of software you are using, or method of making or mixing sounds? (Yes, there are standards and an expected high level of expertise). But, as mentioned here on SCOREcast several times, people skills and delivering as promised are always the bottom line. (Under-promise and over-deliver!) I am hoping to bring a perspective to our talks from a POST PRODUCTION angle of sound for picture. One finds that you will never stop learning and growing if you keep your attitude straight. As soon as you think you know a lot, it can be revealed that you may have a lot to learn. Watching and learning about ‘each person’s unique way’, can reap huge results in the long run.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere are two kinds of ‘people managers’- one that feels the need to surround him or herself with people who are as good as or better than them, elevating EVERYONE; and others who need to be the “top dog”, surrounded by lesser talent, and thereby no threats. I have observed some of the most successful people in our business over the last 29 years, and the common thread has been--collaboration. When the horses are allowed to “run the race”, letting artists “do what they do”, projects seems to move along in a smoother, happier way. Yes, there has to be a “mommy or a daddy”, someone to make the ultimate decisions and wrangle the project responsibly. When done in the spirit of cooperation and respect, each project is the better for it. A healthy ego and confidence are so important, but they thrive in a collaborative environment.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo, how does this relate to competition? Well, one thing I am hoping for is the chance to reach out to the musical community, finding common ground, and see what we can all do to make our projects more successful. I think anyone reading this can relate an experience where they arrived at the studio, or the mixing stage with one perception of a game plan, only to find others have a completely different view. Game planning, pre planning, laying out ideas in advance, can only benefit the creative choices that are coming. In a perfect world, everyone on a project would know in advance where music will take the lead in a scene; where sound effects will be leading the way, or, where silence will tell the story. Many times, we arrive on the stage, only to find that everyone has done the same work to tell the story, and then, serious editing and/or compromises are made. Too late. I am an advocate of meeting with the music department and the director early in a project, so that I can be apprised of thoughts and concepts, and help the film makers realize their story. This does not happen often enough. This can even relate to the technical side with sample rates, bit rates, and track numbers as well. All this requires a bit of extra legwork, of course. Pre planning for post may seem like a bit too much work, too early on. However, it can also save a score by allowing it to be “heard” to its fullest (and I don’t mean volume). Coordinating with the other creatives on a project can bring continuity, and reduce surprises later. Of course, the creative process of mixing will affect all the elements brought to a stage, and new ideas can flourish in the right environment. But I would encourage all of us to think a bit about how we can share common goals, and rise above the “competition”.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFor example: many composers have been burned by a mix of their score somewhere down the line. Music was buried, or pared down, or not woven cleanly around dialog and effects. It does help to have a musical mixing crew who understand the “language” of music. Many times, music is handled as “audio wallpaper”..the final touch to the soundscape. (ouch). As a result, a few composers and editors will only deliver a composite track, so that their “mix” can not be altered. There is value in understanding that we on the dubstage should first “do no harm”. We shouldn’t be automatically eq-ing, or rebalancing because we “can”. However, if the goal is the story, then planning splits and track assignments in advance can HELP music to be played, rather than just lowering or raising an overall mix. If a melodic line is playing during a dialog scene, control over pads, and bg’s while softening another orchestra section can actually help the thread of music throughout a film. I will save discussion on splits and tracks and mixing in surround for another column, but this idea of preplanning and collaboration is essential to smart film making. Especially in these days of shrinking budgets with less time allotted for mixing. Although it may seem like expanding track counts delivered to a stage could possibly create MORE work, it actually helps in the long run. A bit of preplanning can go a long way to making a polished product.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMany times, it may not seem practical to work early-on with your post mixing crew. Like anything else in life, we are dealing with people. I think people LIKE to be included in the process. If we use the “KISS” rule (“Keep It Simple Stupid”), a tremendous amount of stress and concern can be relieved. Everyone wants the projects we work on to be the best they can be. Maybe adapting some simple rules of engagement can provide us all with smoother sailing and fewer surprises. Wouldn’t that be nice??? There have been countless times where we get surprised on the mixing stage unnecessarily. Valuable mixing time can be lost to simply setting up and patching! (Yes, we still have to “patch”).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI personally would rather plan in advance as best we can, and hit the ground running on the first day of a mix. To me, it is never desirable to be straining our collective brains figuring out how to lash it all up on the morning of the first day of the dub, and THEN start mixing. (especially with a room full of clients, editors and crew waiting to get going, at whatever rate they are paying) While we can not eliminate all surprises, and change is just about the only thing we can really count on (!), reducing these things only HELPS the creative process, and the hard work of dubbing.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf we think of the mixing console as a musical instrument, and a mixer as a conductor (for the director), all these concepts apply. The key to success is always in the preparation: wood shedding, practicing, planning, and learning the material. As a conductor shapes a musical performance, so does a mixer. Decisions are constantly made; some planned, many spontaneous, but always with purpose. There is not a conductor out there who does not plan what he or she wants to create. And ultimately it all serves the music, and in our case, the film as well. \u003cbr /\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003cbr /\u003e\u0026nbsp;“A film is - or should be - more like music than like fiction.

However, I feel that I cannot go too much longer without stating what I have learned over the years to be the obvious: \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe majority of those who call themselves film composers will never work on a studio feature film, no matter how good their music is.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNow, before you start thinking that I've let the \"Hollywood curse\" of reality get the best of my usual optimism, let me explain what I mean.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs I've worked through the various levels of career that I have (and understand, in many ways I feel that I'm just getting started), I've discovered that as every realized victory has given me access to a new level of play, it has also forced me to learn to play the game differently at every turn. Each time you bust through the ceiling of a new terrace in this career, you have to relearn how to compete. Every new level means you have to be that much more on the ball, that much more aware, that much more agile, more thoughtful, more available, more attentive, more communicative, and more adaptable to the sliding scales of the way your new peer group does business. The way I play the game at the studio level — dealing with Warner Bros., Disney, Fox, Sony, etc. — is NOT the way I play the game when I'm dealing with Joe Producer and his merry band of independent filmmakers. In fact, it is completely different. I've changed the way I do business so drastically since the time that I started out that it often seems those \"salad years\" happened to somebody else.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe fact is that you might be perfectly happy as an independent film composer. It's a great place to be; a wonderful level to work at with incredibly talented filmmakers popping up all over the place, and amazing rewards for you as a composer. But even IF you plan on staying at that level, and not pursuing studio level features, you would do yourself a favor by adopting the competitive habits and practices of studio-level composers. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhy? Because. Studio-level composers have a bevy of issues to concern themselves with in regards to staying competitive that you will most likely never even have to think about as an indie filmmaker. Imagine being the independent composer in your area that runs his or her ship like a 5-star Hollywood film studio would expect you to. Imagine the reputation you would build if you were just slightly quicker at responding to production problems, better at communicating with the producers, easier to ask for changes from, and were just generally a better oiled music-making machine that never gave problems and rarely caused a flap for anyone. Not only would you be the most obvious choice — assuming your music kicked all kinds of ass, too — but you would also be well on your way to having handled the hard parts of what kills the careers of most Hollywood film music hopefuls.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eStudios do not do things the same way that independent filmmakers do. They can't. If they did, they'd be out of business tomorrow. The pace of the major studio runs at least ten times faster than that of the independent filmmaker. Studios require certain things of their composers that the independent world couldn't care less about. Studio execs place expectations on their composers that independent producers frankly don't ever need to, nor want to, think about.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf you really do desire to make this jump — out of the indie market and into a life of studio features — you'll first need to take the mental leaps necessary to start training yourself for a different kind of competition. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAgain, I'm NOT putting down indie composers! The vast majority of my work is in the independent world. But when I am booked on the Lot of a major motion picture studio and am working on a studio project, my habits and my understanding of the game need to elevate to their level, or I'm in trouble.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLet me run you through a handful of those \"understandings\", in an effort to outline the expectations you'll need to address before you can expect to be at all competitive in the studio realm.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eTHOUGHT 1: A SENSE OF URGENCY\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn my dealings with major studios, certainly one of the most important things I've learned is that when the iron is hot, you HAVE to strike. You cannot wait, and you cannot hesitate. When you find out that there is a television show that is looking for a new musical solution, if you have an \"in\"... you need to get a package through the door, and you need to do it NOW. When you receive knowledge that the studio is unhappy with the way things are going musically with their current composer, and the rumblings of replacement have already leaked to you, it's time to act and act fast.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn the independent world, you might have the luxury of a few days before a decision is made on who gets the job. Therefore, if you get the demo in today or tomorrow... it's not going to make that big a difference. However, on a studio project — particularly in TV — you might have a window of as little as a few hours to get something turned in, and if you are not prepared ahead of time to make that happen, you might as well forget it.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHave your demos ready to rock at ALL times. If I called you right this second and told you I needed a demo sent over ASAP, would it take you a day to put a general reel together for me? You need to have general reels ready to go out the door right now, as well as reels containing specific genres of your material in case you get a request for a \"Dramatic Reel\" or an \"Action Reel\", and so forth. Not being caught with your pants down in regards to demo preparedness is sort of \"Studio Feature Film Composer 101\", and is a primary reason why people lose out on gigs at studios.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eYou also need to be able to take meetings when you are called to. Needing to rely on the bus schedule or the Metro to get you to Fox at 4pm on a Friday is going to be a problem if you are coming from the Valley. You need wheels, pure and simple. I recently heard of a guy who is a composer in his mid-30's and he still doesn't know how to drive a car. To me, that's ridiculous. How could you even \u003cu\u003e\u003ci\u003ethink\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/u\u003e you can compete if you cannot even drive yourself to meet with a table of people who want to hand you a job?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTHOUGHT 2: CLEAR AND FREQUENT COMMUNICATION\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn the independent world, you might not hear from your director or producers for a few days/weeks, as they are most likely wearing several hats: director, picture editor, post-production supervisor, color corrector, sound mixer, title designer... you name it, they're doing it. By contrast, in the studio world, everyone has a job (usually protected by a union), and everyone does that job, and THAT job only. Therefore, your principals are not running like crazy people as much as they would be if they were handling every minor detail personally. They have a lot more time on their hands to \"manage by walking around\" then they would if they were producing an independent feature.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTake it upon yourself to lead the way in making calls to check in as a team. Make sure that your principals don't have to ask you twice if you \"spoke with the editor about that change in the picture\" or whether or not you uploaded the file you promised to the night before. Don't make them repeat themselves. Make promises sparingly, but keep them faithfully. If you cannot pull something off in the time you know you have to do it, don't commit to doing it during that time frame. But no matter what, pick up the phone and communicate.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd another thing: Stop \"texting\". There is nothing more unprofessional than receiving a text message from someone that contains information that would be better communicated in person or voice to voice over the telephone. \"I'm five minutes away,\" is a text. \"I'm going to run 5 grand over budget,\" is a phone call. :-)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHere is my personal code of conduct when it comes to communicating with higher-ups in the studio realm: \u003ci\u003e\u003cb\u003eLess is more, accuracy is imperative, and person to person is always better.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/i\u003e That last part is important for several reasons. First, it gives you the opportunity to either be heard audibly or seen physically — which is always a good thing. Secondly, texts, emails, and voicemails get buried. Voice to voice contact or face to face meetings (if it is time-appropriate) make YOU a priority — you aren't on some list somewhere... you are standing there fully engaged with the person. Way better.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eTHOUGHT 3: PROBLEM-FREE PARTICIPATION\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eStudio executives are some of the busiest people I've met in this industry. There is a misconception out there that if you work at a studio, you spend the majority of your time sitting around and watching the clouds roll by.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNot true.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI've also heard frustrated composers say things like, \"I could do that job — be a studio executive.\" Umm... no, you couldn't. You don't have it in you. The fact that you are saying that is only the tip of the iceberg as to why you'd never have the chutzpah to work on the Lot. Trust me.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI've become close to several studio people in the years I've been doing this and let me tell you… there's no group of people who work harder under more pressure. The Studio Lot is a place of ridiculous intensity where ungodly expectations are being put on people day in and day out. I'm sure that you have at one point or another experienced the pressure of working for an employer who is concerned for his or her \"bottom-line\". Studios are no different, except that when the bottom-line isn't met every quarter, heads will literally roll. It is a pressure-cooker atmosphere that chews up and spits out the very best people in Hollywood on a fairly regular basis. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt is because of this already intense pressure to achieve the numbers that you, as a third-party freelance contractor, should never present a problem without a solution. Studio people simply do not have the time for extra problems, let alone ones that YOU are creating. You want to get in with the people who are the movers and shakers of the industry? Be a Solution. You've heard it said before that there really is no such thing as \"writer's block\". I mean, there IS... everyone gets stumped every once in a while, yes. But there truly is, however, no such thing as the \u003ci\u003eexcuse\u003c/i\u003e of it. You simply cannot show up to an approval session with no cues in hand and blame it on the fact that you couldn't think of anything to write that day, right?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWell, being a problematic composer on a studio film is the exact same thing. If you are a pain in the ass, you'll literally \u003ci\u003enever work with them again\u003c/i\u003e. That phrase is not just a cliche. I see it all the time.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe opposite approach is best. I remember the first opportunity I had to provide additional music for Disney on a project. At the orchestral sessions, on a break, I overheard one of the executives from the music department asking the music editor if I was \"playing ball\" with them; meaning, was I being cool, getting my work done, and not causing headaches. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe editor answered with a smile, \"Oh yeah! He's done everything we've needed him to do, without fail. He's great!\" \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\"Good,\" said the executive. \"I like when it's easy.\"\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHearing that from someone I respect like that studio executive made my decade. To know that I was being regarded as a team player and not someone who was creating drama or friction on what had already a bit of a roller-coaster project for them made me feel like the king of the world. The sessions were incredible, my music sounds great in the film, and both Disney and the director were happy with the job I did. Big BIG win.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd that's how you want to be. You want to be the person that comes in, does the job, encourages others to be their best, and pushes the production along as best you can with no controversy, drama, politics, or bullshit. No grandstanding, no ego, no crap — just pure, raw, energy that is excited to be there and thankful for the opportunity to prove that you've got the goods.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eConfident humility\u003c/i\u003e. That's what it's all about.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eTHOUGHT 4: LET THE STUDIO SYSTEM WORK\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMaking the leap from independent films to studio features takes some time. Just as you didn't work your way from $5k indie features to million dollar indie features overnight, you're also not going to be handed a theatrically-released studio feature to score right out of the gate. It's nothing personal, you just aren't worth the risk yet. You are still an unproven entity to any major studio. With hard work, perseverance, and a small amount of magic, you'll get your chance, but you have to let the studio system do its work for you. It will, if you let it. And here's a tip: The sooner you start thinking of the studios as potential \"partners\" on gigs and not as potential \"suppliers\" of gigs, the quicker the stars will align for you.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBe patient... and more importantly, be respectful. If you are lucky enough to get in the door so far as to be told \"we'll let you know\", do not call the next day if you still don't \"know\". If you do things like this, you are already considered a problem.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI know a guy who called the studio that had already informed him that he didn't get a gig for weeks after, with the intention of \"keeping his name in circulation\". I've heard people refer to these types of folks as \"tail waggers\". The moniker sounds silly, but it is accurate. Susie and I had a dog once and this is how he acted when he wanted \"treats\". If you come across that way as a composer, imagine how a studio executive would view you as a potential business partner. Studio: 1. You: 0.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBeing persistent has its advantages, but being a pain in someone's ass never does. It takes a lot to run a major studio, and the film you are gunning for is one of hundreds in production. Just because people aren't falling all over themselves to return your phone calls doesn't mean they aren't working to get you on the gig. Let them do their job and be patient.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eCONCLUSION\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThese are only a few thoughts I've had this month as we've beat this topic senseless around here.

The first time I pitched for a gig, it was an unpaid feature. I was fresh out of postgrad college and needed to get a credit and some showreel fodder urgently. I beat 40 other composers, wuh yeah! … but I think I had an unfair advantage at that level, and it was pretty much a done deal that I'd win. It was unpaid, and a student film too. I figured after the fact that not many composers with my experience, training and skill would probably go for a gig like that.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMoral of the tale - shoot low.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMy god, that's awful advice, that can't be right.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ePerhaps rather it should be… be better than the competition! But what does 'better' mean. Let us know your thoughts in the Comments below.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe second time I pitched, I didn't get the gig. There were two other composers in the running, and the best man won, to be fair. The pitch was very specific and precise, and I twisted it a little to suit my style, skills and gear. I had a few redrafts too after feedback, which meant I got closer to the desired product, a luxury not usually afforded to pitching composers. I think I was treated better since I'd worked with the director before and he was in my corner! \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWhen I heard the music on the show though, I realised why I didn't get the gig.

It was not a passion project, but rather a friend's film, co-produced with a big-name channel, destined for broadcast - and so had the promise of back-end royalties. My heart became less in it when I got 3 very different briefs over the course of 6 weeks with various revisions going back and forth. By the end, I was still putting in the effort, but the love for the work had gone. Ugh.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCan you guess whether I got the gig?

Surprisingly (or not), no, partly because by this point I had developed that elephant-thick skin that is so important when dealing with criticism and/or rejection. But partly I was also a little relieved. The brief was really tricky to pin down and changed with every new conversation I had… and I took that as a sign of things to come. Also the tracks I wrote were awesome and I'm now selling them as library tracks. Win-win. :-)\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMoral of the tale: \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhen pitching, if the brief is hazy, ill-defined or keeps changing, you better develop some awesome mind-reading skills.

Just don't get too attached to the outcome.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf a brief keeps changing as you pitch, it doesn't bode well for the rest of the gig even if you do somehow win the commission.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf it's not a passion project, or even a subject matter that interests you vaguely, the other benefits better be good. 'Cos if they're not… why are you pitching for it in the first place? There has to be some inspiration for those lines and dots, you know.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe music you wrote should be pretty awesome if you put your all into it. It still belongs to you. Why not flog it through a music library, or offer it to your local filmmaking buddies for non-exclusive licensing, if it's appropriate for that sort of project. Sell it on iTunes. Don't let it just sit there, put it to work.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eNow, as I write this I'm pitching again.

And not really a brief, more a transcription/reduction of an email conversation between the production company and the funding clients, where they decide that they'd like to compare different styles for the work rather than being very specific. It's really very open-ended. But there are some 'style' tracks that the clients appear to like and also a sample of the video to work to, which gives an idea of where they're headed. And the genre of the project is sooooo in an area that I really want to get into, so the love is there. \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo this one is a little bit of an experiment. I'm sticking to the 'vibe' of the style tracks, but they're definitely in my 'niche' writing style too. I'm providing lots of variety within those styles, some very contemporary, some more orchestral and cinematic and also there'll be tracks that blend the two styles.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf I get the gig, I want to be writing music that I want to write, that I love to write, that will make me jump out of bed in the morning in the knowledge that I'm scoring a series I'm excited about.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf I'm not the right gal for the gig with these tracks, I won't be gutted that I didn't get the job.

If the only correspondence we've had is the one e-mail you sent with links to your website and your work—and if that e-mail ends with something like \"please give me a call or an e-mail so that we can discuss how much money you'll be paying me,\" you're pretty much hosed before you even got started. It's a turn-off. You're making me feel like I'm just a sub-boss monster in the video game of your life. And you're gonna blast me with your spam cannon and get onto the next level. I'm not that easy… and neither are most filmmakers.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI like meeting new people, especially music people, and even more especially music people who are \u003ci\u003eon fire\u003c/i\u003e to get their careers going. But a little unclenching in this particular department works wonders. Building relationships takes time… at its best, it happens organically. And trying to force those relationships—looking at them too much like they're something to be shooting your way through, rather than nurturing and enjoying—is, to my way of thinking, over-competitive.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eNext up: gear.\u003c/b\u003e We've talked about GAS (Gear Acquisition Syndrome) around here before, and I freely admit to succumbing from time to time. What I sometimes find, though, is film music pros snapping up a whole new array of toys merely out of a desire to race in the Gear Derby. Again, it's competing in the wrong event.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI'm not suggesting that it's not important to stay up on the latest stuff; it definitely is. But it's a means to an end. And there's a pacing to the thing: it ought to be at a level commensurate with the gigs you're actually getting (and if you simply \u003ci\u003emust\u003c/i\u003e compare and compete, do so with those peers who are at your own level).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI'd love to have a brand spanking new Euphonix or SSL console; who wouldn't? But I don't need it. It's way out of profile with where I am in my career. And the fact that (insert A-lister here) just bought one, or five, or whatever, shouldn't really bear on my decision. If I let it, I'm allowing my urge to compete over my head put the rest of my finances in jeopardy. And that's dumb. I don't need any more machinery to legitimize what I do.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMy take on this: put the blinders on, run your own race, and unclench. When you need gear, get the best you can afford and no more. (it's enough to have to spend just doing that!)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eLast thought for now: \u003c/b\u003eThere are all sorts of aspects of this biz in which thinking of the struggle as a competition can be healthy. It spurs us on to do more than we might be inclined to otherwise. It takes us out of the safe, familiar zone where no growth occurs. It gives us definitive, often-humbling feedback about how we're progressing.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut competing over who can go the longest without sleeping, or who has neglected their family and friends the longest, or even who can write the craziest number of minutes of music in a day? Somewhere in there is that oft-mentioned line between hard-ass and dumb-ass. Tread carefully. Run the right race.
