<p>Hot off the hit animated show &#8220;Seis Manos&#8221;, composer <strong>Carl Thiel</strong> spends time with Brian talking about the process of creating a ground-breaking international score for Netflix&#8217;s newest ambitious animated adventure. Carl recalls the process of getting the gig, recording an orchestra in Budapest, and combining 70&#8217;s grindhouse, blaxploitation elements, drug cartel sub-themes, and ancient Mexican lore into a colorful caldron of musical flavors, and discusses his perspective on scoring for &#8220;binge watching&#8221; audiences versus serialized television or standalone films.</p>



<p>Brian also answers a listener question about composer unionization and explains the history of why there is no collective bargaining representation for composers in Hollywood.</p>

<p>As Deane winds down his tenure as co-host with Brian (two episodes left!), the boys revisit the long-debated controversy of composers working for free and the recent trend of composers paying out of their own pockets to score films just to build their professional portfolios. Deane and Brian also look at the recent repeal of net neutrality in America and give their initial thoughts on the newest entry to the Star Wars pantheon, <i>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</i>, scored by the legendary John Williams.</p>

<p>SCOREcast&#8217;s new managing director Meena Shamaly sits down with &#8220;Genius&#8221; and &#8220;The Lego Batman Movie&#8221; composer <b>Lorne Balfe</b> for a deep dive into Lorne&#8217;s illustrious career scoring Hollywood blockbusters like &#8220;Ghost In the Shell&#8221;, &#8220;Terminator: Genysis&#8221;, and the Nolan Batman trilogy, as well as network television and multiple triple-A video game franchises. SCOREcast founder Deane Ogden also chats with Output CEO <b>Gregg Lehrman</b> about Output&#8217;s newest offerings in the studio furniture space. At the top of the show, Deane tackles the elephant in the room — Harvey Weinstein&#8217;s sexual abuse allegations that rocked Hollywood last week and how they impact those of us working in the film and television music industries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>COMPOSER CLOUD</strong> by <a href="http://soundsonline.com" target="_blank">Eastwest</a><br />
<strong>$29.99 &#8211; $49.99/month</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>EastWest is very well-known name in all composer households. Their ground-breaking EastWest Quantum Leap Symphony Orchestra was one of the first full-fledged orchestral sample libraries to be developed and still is one of the best entry-level libraries around.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since then, EastWest has continued to constantly innovate by presenting top-quality indispensable tools, spanning a large variety of styles. In 2015, EastWest introduced Composer Cloud and became the first sample library developer to offer a subscription plan for a sample-based product. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While this new model was initially met with mixed responses across the composer community, more and more composers are signing up. So let’s take a look at what the Composer Cloud is and how it can enhance your daily work.</span></p>

<h2>General Overview</h2>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p class="p1"><strong>HOW IT WORKS</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The concept is rather simple really. All you need to do is download the EW Installation center from the Support section of the website. This requires you to sign into your personal EW account and as soon as the Installation Center is installed on your computer, all your previous purchases (before the introduction of the subscription model) and your current subscription are automatically reflected. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Installation Center conveniently manages everything pertaining to your EW libraries. It allows you to download, <img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2292" src="../wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Capture1-389x567.png" alt="Capture1" width="206" height="335" />install, and activate any library you wish, it displays any updates available for your current EW software and it also allows you to relocate libraries should you choose to migrate them to another disk. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A very pleasant surprise was the download speeds. Downloading almost all of the EW libraries took me just a few hours on a 50bpm DSL connection and the entire process was rather painless.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>THE SUBSCRIPTION PLANS</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The introduction of Composer Cloud essentially gives a subscriber access to over 10,000 instruments for a yearly or monthly fee. All Composer cloud subscriptions include the entire EW catalog of libraries and the only difference is the different microphone positions included. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The subscription model comes in 3 different versions : <em>Composer Cloud</em>, <em>Composer Cloud </em>X, and <em>Composer Cloud Plus</em>:</span></p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;But… but… but… it relies on the PLAY Engine&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I know, I know. I must admit that I have had my fair share of troubles with the PLAY engine, but not so many that would stop me from enjoying the vast array of sound colors at my fingertips. PLAY is updated rather regularly and the EW support team is incredibly responsive and accommodating. Mr. Joey Medina was particularly helpful in setting me up and patiently answering any my questions.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I took three months to test the basic Composer Cloud subscription in several different projects, including ones where time was absolutely of the essence. Although I am not using any SSDs for streaming my samples (just plain old 7200rpm drives), aside from a slightly increased loading time, everything worked well and the system was rather stable. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not having used any Hollywood products before I was very impressed by the very expressive quality of many of the instruments, especially the legato ones. Aside from all the very well-known libraries, all subscriptions include some lesser-known older libraries such as “56’ Stratocaster”, “Funky Ass Loops”, “Scoring Tools” and I was able to discover many hidden gems in there that are still extremely useful.</span></p>

<h2>Final Observations</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I can’t say that I will be using all 10,000 instruments in my work regularly but in my opinion, the Composer Cloud is definitely worth its money, especially now that they have introduced a month-to-month subscription. I think of it this way: very often we part with $300-$400 for a library which sounds amazing only to later find out that we can use maybe half of the patches as we imagined we would and the rest fall into obscurity. Well, spending the same amount of money for access to 10,000 instruments for an entire year (even if hypothetically we only used 5,000 of these) makes sense in my mind. Besides, new libraries are coming out every month and many sample libraries become obsolete after a few years (simply because realism is always taken to new levels with each new stride in technology). Instead of spending money on one library in perpetuity &#8211; which could become obsolete after a few years &#8211; I’d rather spend the same amount of money to ‘borrow’ 53+ of them for a year. This becomes relatively obvious when you consider that your needs often change as a composer. Your sampling arsenal could change drastically within a year just based on trends and musical tastes.</span></p>
<p class="p1">The EastWest Composer Cloud is a terrific solution for anyone looking to expand or cultivate a wide palette with just one purchase. As long as EastWest continues to innovate in the sampling market by adding products to their CC lineup over time, subscribing to this service could be a very wise move for anyone looking for the highest quality in sampled sounds.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[For live and on-the-fly sound shaping that features well-recorded source material bundled with extensive effects options, Marble might be your new go-to tool.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>MARBLE</strong> by <a href="http://www.cinematique-instruments.com/page_marble.php" target="_blank">Cinematique Instruments</a><br />
<strong>240 €/ $270</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After releasing the <a href="../2016/01/11/ensemblia" target="_blank">Ensemblia</a> series last year, Germany-based developer <b><a href="http://cinematique-instruments.com/">Cinematique Instruments</a> </b>decided to switch gears and create a unique combination of their trademark traditional-meets-bizarre sounds with clever and innovative programming. The result was <strong>Marble</strong>.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marble is a KONTAKT-based library that runs on the full version of KONTAKT 5.3, comes with more than 800 presets, and is comprised of more than 2,500 samples.</span></p>
<h2>General Overview</h2>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the core of <strong>Marble</strong> lie two parallel sound slots (called “Tracks”) equipped with their respective 16-step sequencers. But there is a twist; each of these two sequencers is completely ‘open’ &#8212; in other words, you can tweak every single one of the twelve parameters provided for each sound slot, individually for each of the 16 steps of the sequencer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the greatest values of this library is its flexibility and tweakability. Cinematique Instruments essentially provide us with a complex yet extremely intuitive and simple-to-use ‘system’ that allows us to combine any of the sixty-four sound sources in as many ways as our minds can imagine, sequence them and tweak each step of the sequence individually and, finally, manipulate everything in real time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The beauty of Marble lies at a single rotating ring that controls an entire effects matrix and which can allow you to shape your sound in real time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>THE GUI</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the first things I immediately loved about this library is the deceptively simple GUI. It is nicely designed and very neatly organized in a way that makes it easy to navigate. Everything is exactly where you expect it to be and you can create your own complex evolving sounds at the click of a button while being blissfully unaware of the complex mechanics and programming lying ‘behind the scenes’. <img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2283 size-medium" src="../wp-content/uploads/2016/03/The-22MASTER22-tab-389x330.png" alt="The %22MASTER%22 tab" width="389" height="330" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2016/03/The-22MASTER22-tab-389x330.png 389w, ../wp-content/uploads/2016/03/The-22MASTER22-tab-300x254.png 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2016/03/The-22MASTER22-tab.png 629w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The entire <strong>Marble</strong> library is accessible via a single Kontakt-instrument patch that is organized into 4 tabs : </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. The “PRESETS” tab allows you to choose any of the included 800 presets at the click of a button. Presets have been organized into categories and sub-categories that are sure to strike a cord with every modern composer, including Ambiences, Bass Lines, Sequences, Drum Beats, Rhythm Essentials and more.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. The “TRACKS” tab is where you can select a different sound source for each of the two “Tracks” and set the values for each of the two ‘open’ step sequencers. You can customize parameters such as velocity, note length, pan, tuning, shape, filter, LFO stutter, reverb, delay, time shifting and playing direction.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3. The final sound/combination of the two tracks then passes through a complex effect matrix which you can customize and control in Real-Time through the “ASSIGN” tab. A 127-step sequencer allows you to easily assign parameter values for each of the onboard effects.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4. Finally, the “MASTER” tab is where you can tweak your sound with a simple turning of the Marble ring (which is connected to the effects matrix at the “ASSIGN” tab), “Freeze” the sound if you wish to play along with the created sequence and set quantization and tempo parameters. </span></p>
<h2 class="p1">Malleability</h2>
<p class="p1">One thing Cinematique Instruments seems to have down really well is all the built-in ways you can mold and fashion their original sample sources into your own unique<img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2285" src="../wp-content/uploads/2016/03/The-22TRACKS22-tab-389x329.png" alt="The %22TRACKS%22 tab" width="389" height="329" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2016/03/The-22TRACKS22-tab-389x329.png 389w, ../wp-content/uploads/2016/03/The-22TRACKS22-tab-300x254.png 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2016/03/The-22TRACKS22-tab.png 635w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /> finished material sounds. With included sound sources such as drum kits, acoustic and electric basses, struck percussion, experimental string FX, woodwinds, classic synthesizers, skin percussions, glitch FX and electronic oddities galore, your possibilities are virtually endless. After you tweak to your heart&#8217;s delight, you can run the finished shape through <strong>Marble&#8217;s</strong> deep FX matrix. This process houses an extensive effects rack module, which includes low and high pass filters, face-ripping distortions, multi-band compression, randomizers, reverbs and more. By simply applying any one or combination of these parameters to your creation, Marble takes on a completely different vibe and enables you to throw your own voicings behind typically traditional instrument sources, making them perfect for video game music, trailer music production, film and TV work, or experimental media applications.</p>
<p class="p1">And…… all of this can happen in Real Time. If you are a live stage performer, this is a huge advantage that most sound libraries are slowly becoming hip to, but <strong>Marble</strong> gets exactly right directly out of the box. Every parameter is flexible on the fly and can be recorded with DAW automation for recall later on or real-time experimental performance – a major asset for the live player or experimental tweakhead composer.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Marble</strong> is a well-designed library that has clearly been created with a lot of forethought into how modern composers like to work and create. The sounds providing the raw material are top quality and have been recorded to Cinematique Instruments’ excellent standards. The ‘open’ 16-step sequencers offer a myriad of sonic possibilities and the fact that the effects matrix offers Real-Time dynamic sound shaping is, in my opinion, this library’s greatest asset. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Marble</strong> is extremely playable and a lot of thought has evidently gone into creating a playable instrument that responds well to both chords and melodic lines, allowing users the freedom to create their own unique soundscapes via a simple and intuitive interface. </span></p>

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span class="s1"><a href="http://cinematique-instruments.com/"><b>Cinematique Instruments</b></a></span><span class="s2"> is a Germany-based developer of unique, odd and rare sample libraries. Comprising of a group of composers/producers, the Cinematique Instruments team is highly attuned to the needs of the modern composer and manages to continuously come up with unconventional yet highly usable libraries.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Their latest flagship product, <a href="http://cinematique-instruments.com/page_ensemblia15.php" target="_blank">Ensemblia</a>, is a unique combination of traditional orchestral and rare modern instruments that is aiming to recreate the sound of the modern chamber orchestra and provide composers with an intuitive tool to create natural-sounding productions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Ensemblia is a KONTAKT-based library that runs on the full version of both KONTAKT 4 and 5 and has recently been updated to version 1.5, adding tons of new features and new instruments. What’s more, following the success of the original Ensemblia library, the Cinematique Instruments team is about to release two further variations, Metallique and Stringed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">So let’s take a look at what this ‘trio’ can add to your arsenal!</span></p>
<h2>General Overview</h2>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The original library comes with a wealth of sonic colors, from classical orchestral and mallet instruments to odd synths and bowed guitars. But the real beauty of Ensemblia, where all sounds come truly alive, is in the clever Kontakt patch programming. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The entire library is organized in just two patches: Longs and Shorts. The large variety of presets available are accessed via the well thought-out user interface. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Longs</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Longs patch allows you to load up to 7 different instruments, each on a dedicated channel strip that gives you individual control over the volume, panning, reverb, and transposition. The magic, however, lies in the Voicing section where you can determine how each chord you play on the keyboard is distributed to the loaded instruments. For example, you can load all four orchestral strings, each on its individual slot, and instruct Ensemblia to assign the lowest note of your chords to the bass, the highest to the violin and the middle ones to the viola and cello.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As if this isn’t clever enough, the &#8216;Longs&#8217; patch has been programmed in such a way so as to automatically recognize where to assign each new note you play, based on its distance from the previous notes. If, for example, you have a Csus4 chord and the F is assigned to the viola, when you move to a C triad, the E will automatically be played by the viola, too!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While you are free to mix and match the available instruments to your heart’s delight, the CI team has provided a wealth of presets neatly organized into intuitive categories, to suit all tastes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2274" src="../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Longs-Master.png" alt="Longs-Master" width="633" height="421" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Longs-Master.png 633w, ../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Longs-Master-389x259.png 389w, ../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Longs-Master-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Shorts</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Shorts patch is excellent for rhythmic figures and ostinato and works in the exact same way (7 instrument slots with individual controls) but it also features an “Arranger” page that allows you to program the exact rhythm each instrument is playing. The presets provided are again well thought-out and neatly organized and can give you anything from dark and frantic to light and atmospheric. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In both patches, a comprehensive “Mixer” section allows you to shape your sound to taste and make it as subtle or as overpowering as you wish!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2277" src="../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Shorts-Master.png" alt="Shorts-Master" width="633" height="421" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Shorts-Master.png 633w, ../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Shorts-Master-389x259.png 389w, ../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Shorts-Master-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></p>

<h2>Ensemblia &#8220;<span class="s1"><b>Metallique&#8221;</b></span></h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Based on the same principles as the original Ensemblia library, Ensemblia Metallique comprises of a large range of metallic mallet instruments (anything and everything from vibraphone to a salad bowl!), all accessible via a “Shorts” patch which allows you to mix and match instruments, program your own rhythms and further shape your sound via the Mixer section.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2276" src="../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Metallique.png" alt="Metallique" width="633" height="421" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Metallique.png 633w, ../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Metallique-389x259.png 389w, ../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Metallique-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></p>
<h2 class="p1">Ensemblia &#8220;Stringed&#8221;</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Stringed variation of Ensemblia brings together all the rare and odd string instruments the CI team has ever recorded: autoharp, monochord, kantele, lute, hammered dulcimer, zither and many more. Since these are mostly plucked instruments, Ensemblia Stringed comprises of just the “Shorts” patch, but this is enough to satisfy even the most demanding tastes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2278" src="../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stringed.png" alt="Stringed" width="633" height="421" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stringed.png 633w, ../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stringed-389x259.png 389w, ../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stringed-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is an unwritten rule-of-thumb that the smaller the ensemble you are composing/orchestrating for the more careful you have to be when choosing voicings, voice leading, doublings, etc. This is one of the reasons why it is said that writing for a string quartet, for example, is much harder than writing for a full string orchestra. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The same is true for sample libraries — large and ‘epic’ ensembles are often easier to make sound realistic but small and intimate are harder. There are many libraries out there that do the ‘big’ sound incredibly well, but what happens when your cue demands a smaller, more intimate sound? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is where Ensemblia excels. It is a library that has clearly been designed with the modern composer in mind. It comes to fill a ‘void’ in the sample library market and it does so incredibly well. Ensemblia offers a large variety of sonic possibilities in an extremely well recorded and programmed package. Added with its beautiful interface, and you have an easy to find your way around the library and create the exact sound you are after. </span></p>

<p>Hot of the success of his score for <em>Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation</em>, composer <strong><a href="http://www.joekraemer.com/" target="_blank">Joe Kraemer</a></strong> sits in with Deane and Brian for the first SCOREcast episode of the year. The trio talk through how Joe approached writing music for one of the biggest franchises in cinematic history and then enjoy some composer banter over the latest piece of another big franchise you may have heard of… a little film called <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em>. But before all that, Deane has a conversation with Logic expert <strong><a href="http://dingdingmusic.com/DingDing/Buy.html" target="_blank">Edgar Rothermich</a></strong>, author of the <a href="http://dingdingmusic.com/DingDing/Manuals.html" target="_blank">GEM</a> series of Logic tutorial texts, about why both composers choose Logic as their DAW and Edgar&#8217;s philosophy of deeply understanding your composing tools.</p>

Last November, Deane and Brian took on the great James Horner… and got a ton of email for it. Not against taking on Horner, but in favor of their next autopsy victim being the legendary Alan Silvestri. 2015 marks the 30th anniversary of the release of BACK TO THE FUTURE and the boys devote their second Sacred Score Postmortem to a real-time rip-roaring ride through Silvestri&#8217;s breathtaking action/adventure masterpiece. Also, in a rare full-tilt rant, Brian says the F-word for the first time on the show. Well, there&#8217;s other important stuff, too… but… ahem… BRIAN SAYS THE F-WORD FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THE SHOW!!!!</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Peter developed his original version of SkiSwitcher in 2008 out of frustration that keyswitching patches didn&#8217;t always play back with the correct articulation. This is a problem you’re probably familiar with, too! Though the original version of the system solved this problem, the newly-introduced scripting capabilities of Logic Pro X allowed him to both simplify its operation and greatly expand its capabilities beyond just working with keyswitching patches.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SkiSwitcher2 is an articulation switching system that allows you compose and produce music without having to worry about: </span></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">learning the keyswitches of each different library you own;</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">navigating a project with 300+ tracks because you need to host each articulation on a different track; </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">having to play your work back from a specific point because keyswitches don’t ‘chase’;</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">having to spend hours to ‘clean up’ your project in order to print out a usable score after you’ve already spent hours composing the actual music.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So let’s look at what SkiSwitcher2 can actually do for you: </span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s3"><strong>Intelligent Keyswitching</strong>: </span><span class="s1">When using a keyswitch patch (e.g. CS2, EWQL keyswitch patches etc), you usually need to be very careful when playing back your work because keyswitch notes don’t work if they are not included within the playback passage. With SkiSwitcher2, the notes of your music select their own articulations. In other words, information about the appropriate articulation is ‘embedded’ into each note and no matter where in the timeline you choose to playback your work from, all notes will play back using the correct articulations.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s3"><strong>Polyphonic Keyswitching</strong>: </span><span class="s1">With SkiSwitcher2 you can play chords and set each chord note to play back using a different articulation. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s3"><strong>Articulation Name Display</strong>: </span><span class="s1">SkiSwitcher2 not only allows you to enter a specific label for each articulation you use but it also displays the articulation name in real time. This way, you no longer have to play the guessing game when playing a line with a keyswitching patch; you know exactly what you are playing every single moment.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s3"><strong>Taming the track-count beast</strong>: </span><span class="s1">Let’s face it; having to scroll through five screens’ worth of tracks while riding the inspiration wave is not very productive. Non-keyswitching libraries (e.g. LASS, some EWQL libraries etc) dictate that you have to use 1 track per articulation thus significantly increasing your track count. SkiSwitcher2 offers you a way to combine up to 16 different articulations into a single track, essentially allowing you to treat a multi-timbral plugin like Play or KONTAKT as a single keyswitching patch. How cool is that? </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s3"><strong>Hybrid Instruments</strong>: </span><span class="s1">These are special a special kind of instrument setup that let you override articulations that you don’t use in keyswitching patches and ‘replace’ them with individual articulations from other patches.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s3"><strong>Consistent Keyswitches</strong>: </span><span class="s1">Having to learn the keyswitches of each different library you use is daunting to say the least. SkiSwitcher2 provides a solution to this problem, too, by allowing you set a universal key range as your keyswitching range and apply this to every library you use. Additionally, if you have a 2nd keyboard lying around, you can easily incorporate this into your setup and use it for keyswitching purposes.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s3"><strong>Easy Score creation</strong>: </span><span class="s1">Since you no longer have to include keyswitch notes in your MIDI regions, score creation becomes a much easier and more straight-forward affair.</span></li>

<h2>Installation</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><div id="attachment_2256" style="width: 399px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2256 size-medium" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1-389x194.png" alt="1" width="389" height="194" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1-389x194.png 389w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1-300x150.png 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1.png 395w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256" class="wp-caption-text">fig. 1: Installation</p></div></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before we move on, let me clarify that although I’ve been using Logic since early 2009, I was completely and utterly unfamiliar with anything Script-like until getting my hands on SkiSwitcher2. If you are a script-newbie like myself, you are in good hands because Peter Schwartz has gone to great lengths to make make sure the Scripter can be configured entirely from its front panel, and that end-users never have to do any coding.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SkiSwitcher2 comes in a neatly organized folder, including everything you need to get up and running in no time: </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A video installation guide that takes you through the process step-by-step.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Three different PDF documents explaining everything about how SkiSwitcher2 works, how to make it work for you and offering tips and tricks on how to actually implement it into your own setup. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">The SkiSwitcher2 logic project file that you need to open in order to obtain the SkiSwitcher2 script; and</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A “CC Cloner” KONTAKT preset file to help you set up SkiSwitcher2 with KONTAKT-based libraries. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following the instructions outlined in the installation guide video I was able to install SkiSwitcher2 easily and without any problems whatsoever.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1">In Action</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since I am hosting all my libraries on a separate slave PC, Vienna Ensemble Pro is a key ingredient in my workflow and I was anxious to see how SkiSwitcher2 would work in this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>slightly complicated setup. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Below, I will explore how SkiSwitcher2 worked in three different situations: with keyswitching patches, with multi-timbral instruments and when incorporated into an existing template.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s1">I. SKISWITCHER2 AND KEYSWITCHING PATCHES</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Setting up SkiSwitcher2 with a keyswitching patch took me all of 5 minutes. After having installed SkiSwitcher2 as per the Installation video’s instructions, I loaded a violin keyswitching patch from EWQL Symphony Orchestral library (18V KS Master) and loaded the Scripter plugin in Logic, with the appropriate SkiSwitcher2 preset. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2257" style="width: 313px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2257" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2.png" alt="2" width="303" height="455" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257" class="wp-caption-text">fig 2: Scripter</p></div></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since SkiSwitcher2 offers real-time articulation display, I spent a couple of minutes entering all the articulation names included in the 18V KS Master patch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then, it was just a matter of playing the melody with my right hand and the articulations on the left. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Each articulation I played was neatly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>displayed on the Scripter interface. Since PLAY is hosted on an external slave PC, this was extremely useful because it eliminated my need to constantly look at a second screen to see what articulation I am playing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The resulting MIDI region simply included the melody notes and absolutely no keyswitching notes. Every bit of information needed to trigger the correct articulation was embedded into the notes themselves, via the MIDI channel. If you look at the event list of the MIDI region, you’ll see the MIDI channels changing to reflect the different articulations I was triggering at each<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>point. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Figure 3 shows how the score would look:</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2259 size-large" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5-640x74.png" alt="5" width="620" height="72" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5-640x74.png 640w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5-389x45.png 389w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5-300x35.png 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5.png 1149w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2259" class="wp-caption-text">fig 3: Score output</p></div></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This phrase goes through 7 articulation changes and there are absolutely NO keyswitches present in the score! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Needless to say that when I played it back, all parts played correctly and absolutely no note-chasing was needed. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s1">II. SKISWITCHER2 AND MULTI-TIMBRAL PLUGINS </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Setting up SkiSwitcher2 with a multi-timbral instance took me 10 minutes, including the 4 minutes I spent brewing a new cup of coffee!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After loading 7 different LASS 2 lite Violin I articulations in a single KONTAKT instance, I loaded SkiSwitcher2 and this time I selected the “Multi-Timbral” option. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This works in the exact same way as described in the previous version. The only difference is that the different channels now represent different patches loaded in the instrument plugin and not keyswitches present in the same patch. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To take it a step further, SkiSwitcher 2 allows the creation of a special kind of instruments, the so-called “</span><span class="s2">Hybrid</span><span class="s1">” instruments. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Imagine this: there is a specific keyswitching patch from EWQL Orchestra that you absolutely love but you find the legatos a tad lacking. What you can now do with the help of SkiSwitcher2 is load this keyswitching patch and then not only override (i.e. exclude) the articulations you don’t like (i.e. the legato) but also use another patch in their place essentially creating a hybrid instrument comprising of different patches even from different libraries!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s1">III. SKISWITCHER2 AND POLYPHONIC KEYSWITCHING </span></strong></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2261" style="width: 399px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2261" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2261 size-medium" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/7-389x386.png" alt="7" width="389" height="386" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/7-389x386.png 389w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/7-640x636.png 640w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/7-300x298.png 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/7.png 748w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2261" class="wp-caption-text">fig 4: Event List</p></div></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s where things start to get </span><span class="s2">really</span><span class="s1"> interesting. SkiSwitcher2 allows you to play chords and then assign a different articulation to each note of the chord.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This can work in either the Keyswitching or Multi-Timbral patch type and all you have to do is play your chords and then assign the correct channel using the Event List. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Figure 4 shows two chords C and G/D: The root of the first chord is assigned to channel 1 and plays the legato articulation as expected. The E is assigned to channel 2 and plays a trill legato patch and the G which is held during both chords plays a tremolo legato patch. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This approach could also be extremely helpful if you wanted to quickly assign a MIDI region played with a Strings Ensemble patch, to the individual string sections. Simply create an instance of your plugin with Violins 1 = channel 1, Violins 2 = channel 2, Violas = channel 3 etc and assign each note to the section you wish to be played by.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s1">IV. THE CC CLONER</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last but not least, Schwartz has made sure to include an intuitive way to handle CC messages in SkiSwitcher2. We all know that without our CC11 faders and modulation wheels, we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>cannot possibly imagine creating a realistic MIDI orchestration. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Using a component called “CC Cloner” (included in the SkiSwitcher2 download),<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>you can now choose to ‘clone’ the CC messages recorded on the first channel of the keyswitching or multi-timbral instrument, to all the rest of the channels. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2262" style="width: 351px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2262" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2262" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8-640x409.png" alt="8" width="341" height="220" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8-620x400.png 620w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8-300x194.png 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8-85x54.png 85w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2262" class="wp-caption-text">fig. 5: CC Cloner</p></div></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For example, say I have a KONTAKT instance loaded with 7 different articulations of LASS 2 Lite Violin I patches. It goes without saying that I want the modulation and expression messages I record to affect all 7 articulations. In order to do that, Peter has provided us with 2 choices: </span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">The KONTAKT-based CC Cloner: a custom script you can load from within KONTAKT 4 or 5 and</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">The Scripted-Based CC Cloner: a custom script loaded directly inside Logic via the Logic Scripter</span></li>
</ol>

<h2>Final Observations</h2>

<div class="page" title="Page 5">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modern composers are forced to spend less and less time composing music and more and more time programming and ‘massaging’ MIDI data in order to meet the continuously climbing standards of MIDI production. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SkiSwitcher2 offers a way to simplify our lives and help us focus more on what we need to be doing. Writing music. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have been using this marvel for about a month now (both in large orchestral templates and smaller projects) and it is working without any problems whatsoever. The documentation and video demonstrations were great in helping me understand how to install and use it and Peter Schwartz has one of the best after-sales services I’ve seen to date, always willing to help, answer questions and suggest solutions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The only thing that SkiSwitcher2 can’t do for you at its current version is brew coffee. But, given that Peter is always open to suggestions and feature requests, you never know…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Oh, and at $49 it’s an absolute steal.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://outputsounds.com" target="_blank">Output</a> first came on the sample library scene nearly a year and a half ago with their groundbreaking and highly acclaimed release REV (<a title="REVIEW: REV by Output" href="../2013/11/20/review-rev-by-output" target="_blank">SCOREcast review here</a>). The library was so forward thinking with such an unorthodox concept that many have wondered how they could possibly follow up that release.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The answer comes in the form of their brand new pulse-driven sample library: <b>SIGNAL</b>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SIGNAL<b> </b>combines the warmth of analog and aggressive synthesis with an immense collection of organic, sampled instruments, but the true lure of the library rests with the inclusion of its “Pulse Engine”, which allows for up to four independent, tempo-locking rhythms across two separate sound source layers to create that “heartbeat” at the center of your track.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We will take a detailed look at the library from the ground up to see what’s included, how it operates and ultimately what it will add to your existing sample library arsenal.</span></p>
<h2>General Overview</h2>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SIGNAL<b> </b>requires Kontakt 5.3.1 or higher and is compatible with the Kontakt Free Player. The library is immense, weighing in at around 40GB. Output utilizes the <a title="Continuata Utility" href="http://www.continuata.com/" target="_blank">Continuata Connect Download Utility</a> and I personally had a smooth and swift download of the content.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The library will need to be activated within the Native Instruments Service Center before it will become available within the library pane of your Kontakt browser.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before unpacking this beast, let&#8217;s look at a quick listing of everything included in the library as well as its features:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">500 Pulse Instruments for instant playability</li>
<li class="p1">40GB of content, including analog synths, digital synths and organic instruments</li>
<li class="p1">Up to four separate pulses at one time</li>
<li class="p1">All pulses lock to tempo</li>
<li class="p1">Rhythms: Looper, Step Sequencers, Arpeggiators, LFO’s</li>
<li class="p1">Four central MACRO sliders unique to each of the 500 Pulse Instruments</li>
<li class="p1">Effects can control global parameters and individual layers</li>
<li class="p1">Convolution reverb engine</li>
<li class="p1">Advanced mode for access to all parameters</li>
<li class="p1">Copy and paste settings between layers</li>
<li class="p1">Smart tagging preset menu</li>
<li class="p1">Simple design and ease of use</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Preset Browser</h2>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><div id="attachment_2231" style="width: 399px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://outputsounds.com"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231" loading="lazy" class="  wp-image-2231 size-medium" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SIG_preset-e1427864112660-389x334.png" alt="SIG_preset" width="389" height="334" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SIG_preset-e1427864112660-389x334.png 389w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SIG_preset-e1427864112660-640x550.png 640w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SIG_preset-e1427864112660-300x258.png 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SIG_preset-e1427864112660.png 683w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2231" class="wp-caption-text">Preset Browser</p></div></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SIGNAL<b> </b>contains just one patch in the instruments folder by which all the contents of the library can be accessed, which I think it is a brilliant layout. The developer recommends (and I agree) that you access the “preset” browser page first when initially diving into the library. This can be accessed by simply clicking on any preset name (e.g. &#8220;Dark Clacks&#8221;, pictured above) from the main page. The browser is laid out in a familiar, yet very welcomed format; simply click on one (or many) of the “smart tags” in the left-side palette and the right window pane will provide a listing of compatible instruments, based on your choices.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are five hundred — That&#8217;s right… 500! — different instruments in SIGNAL<b> </b>and<b> </b>I couldn’t have asked for a better way to audition them than the way this browser is constructed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So how does it sound on a first play through?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I clicked on “Epic” and “Organic” and chose the patch “Sun King” from the browser – I played a three-note D minor triad and heard a deep, gritty, pulsating arpeggiated figure with two intersecting polyrhythms. Awesome. I proceeded to get lost over the next hour sampling various different instruments from the browser and the immediate attention to the production value and execution of the patches were very impressive.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s move over to the “Pulse Engines” page to get under the hood and see what SIGNAL reveals…</span></p>
</div>

</div>
<h2>The Pulse Engines</h2>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><div id="attachment_2233" style="width: 399px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://outputsounds.com"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2233 size-medium" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.12.10-389x374.png" alt="" width="389" height="374" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.12.10-389x374.png 389w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.12.10-640x615.png 640w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.12.10-300x288.png 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.12.10.png 649w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2233" class="wp-caption-text">Pulse Engines</p></div></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The true heart of SIGNAL rests within its “Pulse Engines” page. At first glance the layout may seem daunting and complex, but Output has made the source audio flow so intuitively that you’ll want to dig deeper and deeper at the sounds and the engine’s capability.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SIGNAL<b> </b>gives you two separate sound sources that can be loaded and played in unison. Simply clicking on the “Signal Pulse Engines” window in the middle of the page will disable the pulse engine, leaving just the sound sources by themselves. Each sound source has it’s own channel strip  and when you click on the instrument picture/name it will open the sound source browser. There is an immense collection of synths and organic instruments in the browser that can be quickly loaded into the existing patch. This is a fantastic addition as you can quickly tryout new sounds in your loaded instrument that may mesh even better to your ears than before. Don’t want the “Sub Sine”? Why not load up a deep sampled “Muted Guitar” and see how that sounds? The possibilities are endless. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Let’s focus on <em>Pulse Engine A</em> for now (<em>Pulse Engine B</em> has all the functionality identical to Pulse Engine A). You will see a tab of “Main Rhythm” and “2</span><span class="s2"><sup>nd</sup></span><span class="s1"> Rhythm”, each able to be activated or deactivated by clicking the corresponding power switch. The “Main Rhythm” is the first engine your source audio will pass through and you have multiple options to create that “pulse” from the audio. SIGNAL<b> </b>gives you access to a Wave Form (LFO), Step Sequencer, Arpeggiator or a Loop mechanism (see picture above under Engine B) to modulate the audio signal. Regardless of which option you choose, you can manipulate the time format via bars, standard signatures (1/2, 1/4, 1/16, etc.), and dotted or triplet subdivisions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The “2</span><span class="s2"><sup>nd</sup></span><span class="s1"> Rhythm” will take the carrier signal through an additional rhythmic manipulation, available to you via LFO or Step Sequencer. The level of control and audio quality of all these parameters is stunning, making it simple to create highly useable and complex rhythmic figures on the fly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As mentioned, all this can be done with Pulse Engine B as well, but with a completely separate (or same) audio source.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> SIGNAL</span> also makes it very easy for you to copy/paste one rhythm in Pulse Engine A to Pulse Engine B through an elegant transfer window. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232" style="width: 399px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://outputsounds.com"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2232" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.03.11-389x374.png" alt="Macro Sliders" width="389" height="374" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.03.11-389x374.png 389w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.03.11-640x615.png 640w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.03.11-300x288.png 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.03.11.png 649w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2232" class="wp-caption-text">Macro Sliders</p></div></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The four available macro sliders are perhaps the most flexible and intuitive feature in SIGNAL. Output meticulously crafted these macros so they are completely unique to each of the 500 instruments found in the library. I immediately assigned each macro slider to an available slider on my MIDI controller. The macros can make the sound modulate from subtle to drastic just from the flick of the slider. For instance, you can distort, widen, open/close filters, blend layers or completely change one of the four available rhythms on the fly. Moving around all four macros at the same time pull out instant inspiration and promote these patches for live performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is a Macro Page from the instrument menu that will allow you too see which particular instrument parameters are being controlled by the sliders and these can be further adjusted as well.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Fifty episodes, hundreds of topics, more than seventy hours of recorded conversation… but until now, Deane and Brian have never ventured out into the wild of a live SCOREcast event and recorded an episode. For the milestone of our 50th show, the boys host the SCOREcast NAMM Dinner in Anaheim, California – an annual event that draws dozens of composers, orchestrators, developers, performers and fans – and finally chat with the developer of ERA 2: Medieval Legends, <a href="http://www.samplelibraries.com/" target="_blank">Eduardo Tarilonte</a>; president of <a href="http://www.bestservice.de/en" target="_blank">Best Service</a>, Wolfgang Wanko; Mike Peaslee, Gregg Stephens and Chris Marshall of <a href="http://soundiron.com/" target="_blank">SoundIron</a>; cinematic vocalists <a href="http://www.uyangamusic.com/" target="_blank">Uyanga Bold</a> and <a href="http://www.aeraliebrighton.com/" target="_blank">Aeralie Brighton</a>; and Sam Estes and Michael Hobe of <a href="http://sonicsmiths.com/" target="_blank">SonicSmiths</a>. It&#8217;s a loud, margarita-fueled night, and a detailed insight into the business of creating the sample libraries that we all use on a daily basis. It&#8217;s the 50th episode of the SCOREcast Podcast Show!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ozone 6 and Ozone 6 Advanced</strong> by <a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/products/mixing-mastering/ozone/" target="_blank">iZotope</a><br />
<strong>$249.99</strong> (Ozone 6/MSRP); <strong>$999.99</strong> (Ozone 6 Advanced/MSRP)<strong><br />
</strong>Purchase Ozone 6 and get more information at <a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/products/mixing-mastering/ozone/" target="_blank">iZotope.com</a></p>
<hr />
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>I know, you see the word &#8220;Ozone&#8221;, that piece of software ubiquitous in conversations about mastering and mixing over the last decade or so, and you are probably thinking, &#8220;here we go with yet another revision…&#8221; and maybe you’ll wait to get it. I thought the same thing, too. But then I started working with it and now I want to go back and re-master all my music again, as if learning RX4 over the last few weeks wasn’t already enough. Obviously, I am a fan of iZotope’s products and have been using them nearly every day for at least the last six years, but Ozone 6 is such an advancement in already stellar technology that it warrants a full review on its own.</p>
<p>With a product like Ozone, the clarity and functionality let alone the ease of use, make this product worth a workout. And, if all that is not enough for you, iZotope provides comprehensive mastering guides and tips to their customers. Let’s face it, unless you are a full time mastering engineer, the process of mastering audio can be tricky and, for the untrained ear or even a skilled engineer, many opportunities could be missed while spinning your brilliant creation into audio gold.</p>
<p>Before you purchase, make sure you are aware of the <a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/products/mixing-mastering/ozone/comparison/" target="_blank">differences between Ozone 6 and Ozone 6 Advanced</a>.</p>
<h2>General Overview</h2>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>For the purpose of this article, I worked in Standalone mode (using the Advanced version), which has some nice advantages, especially when mixing an album or collection. For one, running this outside your DAW, you can devote all the computer’s available resources to mastering alone. This is especially helpful as you can load multiple tracks to master at the same time. They will appear in separate tabs so you can flip back and forth from one to another and retain the last position you were at on each track. I am cleaning up some old boom box recordings and, since multiple songs were recorded in the same session, they all have the same sound issues and I can clean them all together so they sound consistent.</p>
<p>A quick note on running Ozone 6 inside your DAW: it is possible to load just one of the modules at a time as a separate plugin without running the full version. This allows less CPU drainage and expands this product’s uses beyond just mastering your audio after mixing. If you have Ozone 6 Advanced, try the Dynamic EQ on your stereo drum mix!</p>
<p>In addition, with the ability to load in 3rd party plugins (or other iZotope plugins such as RX-4), having those system resources could really be the difference in the quality of the final master. This feature alone makes Ozone 6 the most versatile mastering system I have come across.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Interface</h2>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>As expected, you have a transport control system at the top with a repeat feature that comes in very handy and optional play head. Under that is the waveform you’ll be working with. You can set a looping point if there is a specific area you would like to work on. On the right, you have input and output levels to manipulate with their own adjustable meter scale. There is also an auditioning section at the bottom including a bypass, a mono mode (many mastering engineers will tell you to audition in mono as you will hear things you’ll miss in stereo), a swap and a dither. At the bottom, you can select which modules you want to use (up to six) and in what order and even add in additional plugins. Each module icon has a meter so you can see how much impact each is having at any given time, even if you aren’t working with it at that moment. The modules run in order from left to right as your signal path so the order of the modules will have a distinct effect on the mastering process. There is even a lengthy and adjustable Undo history available if you’ve gone too far with changes. I can’t recall a historic feature in any program I have worked on where I could specifically mark points in time, but you can do that here.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Since each module has a dedicated power button, if you hear a noise or sound but cannot figure out where it is coming from, you can turn on and off the modules in any combination to assist in isolating that annoying little bugger. Keep in mind that it may be a combination of modules in the process so shutting them down right to left, one at a time, seems like a good place to start.</p>
<p>A sweet additional feature is the ability to create fade-ins and fade-outs. This means you still have some flexibility without having to export your master again, allowing you additional time before you have to make that final decision. Since all the songs are in one place and, presumably, you’ve loaded them in the order they will appear on the album, you can get a feel for how one song moves into another and set your fades accordingly while trimming off noise at the beginning or end of each track.</p>
<p>Even the meters are more functional since you can switch them between standard left/right metering and mid/side metering. Perfect for those times when you adjust the EQ view to mid/side. They also have a vast variety of viewing options.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Equalizer</h2>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>This is one of my favorite modules and, most likely, the one you are going to spend the majority of your time perfecting and will be the basis of any additional modules you use. I suggest this as the first module in the chain (but always open to other ideas). With 8 bands to work with in 3 different viewing modes, you have just about all the flexibility you could ever want. Intelligent color coding allows you to make adjustment decisions quickly. Even using 2 bands to immediately put on a high and low pass filter (which is the first thing I tend to do when mastering audio), you still have 6 for more fine tuning or frequency minimizing/maximizing, which you can power off for quick and easy monitoring of the other bands and what affect they are having on your mix. As if that were not enough, you have all kinds of curve options at your disposal.</p>
<p>If you are unsure where to start, Ozone 6 and Ozone 6 Advanced come with a huge selection of templates. I often make templates based on instrumentation I use repeatedly or per film project or even per theme. Most experienced mastering engineers I speak with like to start from scratch each time. For us film composers, we tend to work under some pretty crazy deadlines so I find templates work a bit better for me in a pinch. You can always modify the layout to suit your specific needs for that piece of audio. In fact, it would be nearly impossible to find a template that worked 100% as is but it may help narrow down what you need to do. You don’t even have to make this decision at the beginning. You can change to a template at any time and hit Undo to go back if you want to compare.</p>
<p>Digital mode versus analog mode: You have the option to switch between the two. Since this is not a physical equalizer hooked up to your sound card through cables, the analog equalization is created via modeling. This option helps you identify differences in phasing as well as give you more control options. The digital mode also allows you access to surgical mode, which allows you even more precision in isolating and changing frequency issues.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>With EQ matching, you have one of the greatest features I have ever heard of. You can actually sample the EQ model of a piece you like and imprint it onto another piece. This has been greatly simplified since Ozone 5. I haven’t played with this a great deal just yet because there are so many variables but I could see this being especially useful on a mix you want to duplicate to a series of other tracks such as my boom box recording cleanup project or mastering an album or collection of songs or even as a learning tool to see how commercially released songs were EQ’d.</p>
<p>The Advanced version has 2 additional choices for equalization: Dynamic EQ and the Post Equalizer. You<img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2214" src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ozone_eq-389x174.png" alt="ozone_eq" width="389" height="174" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ozone_eq-389x174.png 389w, ../wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ozone_eq-640x286.png 640w, ../wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ozone_eq-300x134.png 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ozone_eq.png 916w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /> can use these individually or in line with each other to really narrow down frequency issues. If you need more than 6 modules to utilize these, export out what you have so far and start a new session with the additional modules but keep in mind, everything that you did to modify your mix thus far is baked in like sugar into a cookie.</p>
<p>The Dynamic EQ responds differently than a Static EQ. A Static Equalizer will respond exactly the same regardless of the incoming volume of the signal. The Dynamic Equalizer responds based on the volume of the frequencies, allowing you to keep the integrity of the overall sound and boost or cut where you need to. In addition, there is a threshold setting for maximum output. I find a multi-band equalizer like this especially useful more on the individual track, such as a mixed drum track that needs some cleanup to bring out more punch in the kick drum or a bit more snap in the snare. You can accomplish that all in one pass.</p>
<p>The Post EQ basically duplicates the main equalizer. The advantage of this is that since you cannot load a module more than one time per instance, you can add this in as a second EQ in case you want to make additional adjustments after another process has run in the signal path.</p>
<p>With 8 bands, 3 viewing modes, 5 band settings with several setting choices each, multiple monitoring options, and accurate visual representations of what is happening at that precise second with your audio and much, much more, I would be hard pressed to find an equalizer that would match it.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Dynamics</h2>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>This is where you will find your compressor and limiter, each having 4 bands. I’ve heard so many engineers talking about how the middle range needs the most compression in many types of music. Get ready for this cool feature, folks! You have the ability to make adjustments in the middle separate from the sides. This is another one of my favorite features in Ozone 6. If you are more comfortable, you can continue to work in stereo but the mid/side option allows you to get the sound you want from 3 different angles without each one being too affected by the other.</p>
<p>This module is laid out with an intelligent process flow from left to right. For most of you, I would imagine <img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2213" src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ozone6-dynamics-single-band-full-389x260.png" alt="ozone6-dynamics-single-band-full" width="389" height="260" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ozone6-dynamics-single-band-full-389x260.png 389w, ../wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ozone6-dynamics-single-band-full-640x427.png 640w, ../wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ozone6-dynamics-single-band-full-300x200.png 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ozone6-dynamics-single-band-full.png 1150w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" />you are at least familiar with the recording process and this compressor and limiter work exactly the same as you would expect, including a variable knee setting. You have the same full control you did in the equalization process with being able to bypass different sections at any time so you can hear the effect of a specific setting or group of settings.</p>

<p>The difference is the flexibility. You can switch from multiband to parallel. You can link controls for quick band setting. You can change views for ultimate accuracy. You can listen in stereo or mid/side. You can switch from analog to digital or even hybrid. You can set the bands so there is no crossover at all. If you over compress the signal and the overall volume gets too quiet, you can press the Auto button, which will automatically adjust the gain to give your signal some volume back.</p>
<p>The detection filter allows you to take frequencies and tell the compressor to ignore them. In other words, if your base frequency starts at 20 and you want to avoid anything under 100 being compressed, you can set the filter to start at 100, letting more of that low end through. You can also adjust the curve to decide where and how hard to compress.</p>
<h2>Imager</h2>

<div class="column">
<p>While I have wanted to start every section of this review with, “This is one of the most important components of mastering audio&#8230;” I saved it for this. Quite honestly, this is one of the most important components of mastering audio. Here, you have the opportunity to bring out the depth of your creation. I hope you remembered to leave some head room when you ran through the limiter. If not, go back and adjust that now and then double check all your modules between the limiter and here. That one change could have an effect on any component in the signal chain.</p>
<p>The visual meter is a great help with phasing. If the signal is in the middle, you are pretty safe. If you go too far to the sides, you may want to double check your sound and make sure things are not too crazy. There is even a balance indicator to help you keep your mix well panned and a vertical indicator to keep you aware of phasing issues.</p>
<p>When you used the limiter to boost the volume, you filled in some of the spectrum but the Imager will take it the rest of the way by widening it. You can also squeeze it as well in areas it may already be too wide. By the time you are done with this part of the process, your mix should sound rich and full and need only that final boost (unless you choose to process in a different order than I have in this example. There is no clear rule for this because there are so many variables and styles). Play around with this one a bit and really get a feel for what it can do.</p>
<h2>Maximizer</h2>

<p>Here is where you put the final touches and volume on your music. Be careful here not to clip audio anywhere while getting the most out of your levels. If you find a spot that clips, you can isolate it and work on just that spot or go back to an earlier module in the chain to fix it (remember to check everything that followed).</p>
<p>This is far more intense than it appears. Threshold and ceiling levels will be the determining factors in your final output, whether it is headed to a film, to radio or even a CD. You can control things such as the speed of the reaction and determine the final transient emphasis. These things can make the biggest difference in what your audience hears.</p>

<p>This might just be the coolest feature yet. This is run as an additional plugin (but counts as one of the 6 modules) that is solely dedicated to metering. Wonder if the overall mix is too loud or could be louder? This is the plugin for you. It includes True Peak Meters, Loudness Meters, Loudness History, Graph, Stereo Vectorscope, Surround Scope 2D/3D Spectrogram and Spectrum Analyzer. That is a lot in this one little plugin! Perfect for an additional set of digital eyes looking at your levels. Since this is opened as a separate plugin and not a module (while using one of the module slots), you can set this window off to the side while you work with the other modules, keeping this in full view.</p>
<p>One of the best features is that there are very helpful presets here for specific applications in broadcast and media. These are great for helping you stick to those important guidelines.</p>
<p>I would probably spend the extra cash just for this plugin alone and go for the Advanced version. At a current retail of $499.00 for Insight, that almost gets you there anyway.</p>
<p>Time to export you audio and start listening to it everywhere you can but, first, give your ears a rest, and maybe a good night’s sleep. Job well done!</p>

<h2>Final Observations</h2>
<div class="page" title="Page 5">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>I have heard and seen some complaints about the differences between Ozone 5 and Ozone 6, specifically, the removal of the mastering reverb. I would imagine different mastering engineers will tell you different things, but it should be rare you would need this. Effects should be set before mastering begins. That being said, if you find your overall sound does need a touch more reverb, you do have the ability to add in 3rd party plugins, so it&#8217;s really not that big a deal. If you have upgraded from Ozone 5, you may even try loading that into one of the six positions available or any other plugin you have on your system.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 6">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>When loading in multiple songs to master together, changes made to any module affect that track only and do not copy universally to all other tracks. While this can be an advantage, there is no option to modify the process. Let’s take my boom box recording example. I have five songs I am cleaning at the same time. If I dial in a sweet EQ setting and want to apply that to the hiss I hear on all tracks, I have to go into each track and do it manually, save as a preset (that you may never use on another project) or try EQ matching (which would be a bit laborious for this process). I would love to see something a little more flexible, such as a switch that allows you to turn or off an “Effect All Tracks” option. However, this may just be a feature for me but I would think there is potential for others as well.</p>
<h3>Additional Notes</h3>
<ol>
<li>One thing I noticed is that some of the options come up initially powered off and you have to switch them on. A good example is in the Imager, the Stereoizer needs to be manually turned on to be used. With the Equalizer, you only start with 1, 3, 5 and 7. You need to power up 2, 4, 6 and 8 to use them. Keep an eye open for this so you have everything running that you want running.</li>
<li>When working with the equalizers, remember that the dither is only for monitoring. When you export the audio (if in Stand Alone mode), check the Dither box to create that function. Check settings in your DAW when you bounce tracks if you would like the Dither feature to work.</li>
</ol>
<p>In closing, iZotope’s Ozone 6 Advanced is one of the most comprehensive and powerful pieces of software I have ever worked with. It is extensive in ways that very few pieces of audio software are — I have really only scratched the surface of what this beast can truly do. Just in the first couple settings, I was able to make substantial improvements to my music with very little effort and all within the confines of one program. There are so many more little details, this article could have been 5 times as long had I covered them all.</p>
<p>Since iZotope is known to make changes based on user feedback, I would imagine there is a good chance there may be an update in the future. If so, I can’t wait to see what more they could possibly do to enhance the value or functionality of this mastering suite.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Cinematic Keys</strong> by <a title="Sample Logic" href="http://samplelogic.com" target="_blank">Sample Logic</a><br />
<strong>$350</strong> (MSRP)<br />
Powered by full retail <strong>Native Instruments Kontakt</strong> or the free<strong> Kontakt Player<br />
</strong>Purchase Cinematic Keys or listen to demos at <a title="Sample Logic" href="http://samplelogic.com" target="_blank">samplelogic.com</a></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blurring the line between music and sound design&#8221; is the motto that greets you when you log onto <a title="Sample Logic" href="http://samplelogic.com" target="_blank">Sample Logic</a>&#8216;s website. An ambitious statement, but when you see the awards Sample Logic has received since the company began putting together its catalogue of interesting sound libraries back in 2006, you see how it can support this claim. <em><strong>Cinematic Keys</strong></em> offers a lot more than the title suggests, and is a perfect example of Sample Logic&#8217;s motto; it covers realistic­ sounding traditional keyboard instruments, crossing over into score­-ready, dark hybrid sound design. Sample Logic spent a great deal of time recording instruments in an orthodox way and then, quite literally, destroying the instruments with an array of power tools to create truly original and innovative sounds. Whether you are a bedroom producer or a well established composer, Cinematic Keys is great for any genre you are creating.</p>
<p>The library is available for the free Kontakt player and the retail version 5.3.1 or higher, delivered at 44.1k / 24bit. It costs US$350 and takes up a mere 8gb of hard drive space.</p>
<h2>Interface</h2>
<p>The basic layout of Cinematic Keys is clear and it is very simple to navigate through the menus. Instruments and multis are split into three main sections, with an additional three under each category. Atmospheres, instrumentals and percussives belong to the instrument section, while construction beds, instrument stacks and One­-Note Glory reside under the multi page.</p>
<p>Sample Logic has enhanced the original award winning Kontakt interface with a more aesthetically pleasing GUI. Each instrument can access eight real­time audio effects all with a user friendly tiled appearance. When you click on each tile, an additional menu will appear with more customisation at your disposal. The interface includes a bypass ArpeggiGator, Triggers with 64 preset effects, an LFO section and the powerful Step Animator engine. Cinematic Keys is the first library to have the new evolved FX animator, which allows all audio effects to be modulated and sequenced in real time, enabling brand new creative ways of writing and performing sounds.</p>
<p>With 150 presets, the modulation can be used on a per step basis, different durations for each step and synchronised to the animator engine, making Cinematic Keys one of the most innovative libraries to date.</p>
<h2>Sound</h2>
<p>Whether you prefer to work in the realms of sound design, enjoy producing slamming EDM tracks, or strive to create epic orchestral scores, Cinematic Keys offers something for everyone. Under the menu instrumentals you have the choice of pianos, harpsichords, organs and other various keyboard based instruments. The percussives feature hit ensembles, impacts, loops, transitions and sequences, while the atmospheres feature stingers and ambiences.</p>
<p>I enjoy the &#8220;Grand Strum&#8221;, as it is a timbre you don&#8217;t tend to hear in a piano library, whereas the arps and &#8220;Pianos Effectual&#8221; can really help achieve an ominous mood — something you can rely on when creating a tension based score. &#8220;Caged Animal&#8221; is just downright disgusting! It sounds like something straight out of Saw or Silent Hill, and is­ one of my personal favourites.</p>
<h2>Editing</h2>
<p>When using Cinematic Keys, you can find what you are looking for very easily, whether it’s a tone you know well, or you want to go that little bit deeper and edit various settings like the LFO or wave shape.</p>
<p>It can be a tedious process when you’re playing around and trying to create an original sound or tone with absolutely no idea what you’re doing, especially with the more technical features in sample libraries. However, customising the arps in Cinematic Keys felt effortless, and I achieved a personal sound with minimal effort. Everything is laid out in such a user friendly way, whilst still remaining easy on the eyes. I am personally a big fan of creating and implementing arps into my own tracks, and the arpeggiated sounds of &#8220;Out of the Box&#8221; work really well.<img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2205" src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-06-at-12.01.23-PM-389x285.png" alt="Cinematic Keys - SCOREcast Online" width="389" height="285" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-06-at-12.01.23-PM-389x285.png 389w, ../wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-06-at-12.01.23-PM-640x469.png 640w, ../wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-06-at-12.01.23-PM-300x220.png 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-06-at-12.01.23-PM.png 1083w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></p>
<p>When using the software, I found myself breaking out of my regular writing habits and experimenting in ways that I wouldn&#8217;t have tried before. Personally, I feel this is a good thing, especially when you hit that creative block.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The overall quality of sound and architecture of Cinematic Keys is incredibly consistent across the board. It appeals to a wide audience, and with an innovative interface, live performance capabilities and a user friendly design, the US$350 price tag is definitely money well ­spent.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, Cinematic Keys is a contemporary library and, from what I&#8217;ve experienced, it caters better to producers and sound designers rather than to composers. As with anything that is contemporary, a fair portion of it will date eventually, but I&#8217;m sure that won&#8217;t be an issue any time soon. You can achieve great sounds with the smallest amount of effort and delve in deeper with all the popular customisation tools whilst making use of Sample Logic&#8217;s original FX animator.</p>
<p>If you are on the hunt for a library that makes an impact, offers a great range of keyboard instruments, and creates sinister atmospheres with plenty of customisation tools at your fingertips, Cinematic Keys is the sample library for you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Orchestral percussion is a venture that many sample library developers have challenged throughout recent years. The availability of large recording stages &amp; halls in tandem with world class players have provided a wide range of options for the modern media composer. <em>Impact Soundworks</em>, known for their respected line of ethnic instruments, guitar (Shreddage 1 &amp; 2) and sound design (Juggernaut, Celestia) libraries, have crossed into the field with <em><strong>Rhapsody: Orchestral Percussion</strong></em>.</p>
<p>A common theme amongst modern day composers is, “You can never have too much percussion.” I certainly agree with the masses but will still ask, “What will Rhapsody add that I do not already have in my existing orchestral percussion libraries?” Let&#8217;s take a detailed look at the library from the ground up and see how Rhapsody responds to that question.</p>
<h2>At First Glance</h2>
<p>For this review, we took a look at the full version of Rhapsody ($199 intro and $249 regular MSRP), which boasts an impressively large collection of drums, auxiliary percussion, hand drums and chromatic instruments with three user-controllable mic positions. The developer also offers an &#8220;essentials&#8221; version that contains most of the core instruments at 16-bit samples with the close and hall mic positions. All instruments have been deeply sampled with up to 10X round-robin and 5X velocity layers in both the full and &#8220;essentials&#8221; versions.</p>
<p>Both versions will require the latest retail version of Kontakt 5.3. Most of the included instruments contain multiple articulations as well as dynamic rolls that can be controlled via the mod wheel.</p>
<h2>Instruments</h2>
<p>Here is a listing of all the included instruments with those underlined as being included in the ESSENTIALS package(we will look deeper into the organization of the instruments later in the review):</p>

<p>The full version comes with a choice to receive the library as a 16-Bit(4 GB) or 24-Bit(9 GB) package. Both versions are available via download delivery at <a href="http://impactsoundworks.com/rhapsody-orchestral-percussion/" target="_blank">www.impactsoundworks.com</a>. The library comes with a well-documented and comprehensive users guide that can also be downloaded via the product page on their website. I highly recommend reviewing the manual as it has a nice breakdown of all the included instruments and articulations as well as tips on how to use/mix library and conserve system resources.</p>
<h2>Interface</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2180" src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rhapsody_UI_1-389x165.jpg" alt="" width="389" height="165" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rhapsody_UI_1-389x165.jpg 389w, ../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rhapsody_UI_1-300x127.jpg 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rhapsody_UI_1.jpg 631w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></p>
<p>The GUI for Rhapsody certainly gets right to the point and provides the user with an efficient means for editing and sound sculpting the instruments from the ground level. All of the options you need for editing are provided right from the main page with no multiple menus, macros, etc. The GUI supports the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access to all 3 microphone positions — Close, Stage &amp; Far — with control over Mix, Panning and Width. Mics can also be purged from memory to save on CPU.</li>
<li>A menu to pull up a specific instrument (see All in 1 Patches) with individual volume and tuning settings.</li>
<li>Standard ADSR Envelope</li>
<li>3 Band “G” EQ</li>
<li>Access to an internal reverb with settings for wetness and size.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Patches</h2>
<p>The library organizes the patches into 2 distinct options:</p>
<h4>All-in-1 Patches</h4>
<p>Groups of instruments are all included into their respective percussion family and stretched over the range of the keyboard. For instance, ROP Aux Percussion will contain all of the auxiliary instruments into one patch. The instrument selector allows the user to make individual adjustments to all editable features for that specific instrument or articulation(the articulation is also displayed in a box each time the respective key is triggered on the keyboard). There is also an option to have any changes applied globally to all the included instruments. These patches also allow the user to split the instruments out along multiple outputs through Kontakt.</p>
<h4>Single Instruments</h4>
<p>We also have the choice of splitting each instrument into its own patch versus globally with the other instruments. This has become a common practice with many developers but completely is up to the user’s preference. I personally prefer the single instrument approach but many of my colleagues do prefer the latter. It is worth noting that all the patches in Rhapsody provide an option to save any preferred settings that can be recalled for later use.</p>
<h2>Overall Sound and Playability</h2>
<p>So lets get back to the original question and see if we can provide some insight into what may or may not set Rhapsody apart from our existing crop of Orchestral Percussion libraries. Impact Soundworks’ noted intention with the library was to provide a flexible and efficient route to Orchestral Percussion that can easily fit into whatever orchestral palette you frequent.</p>
<p>Loading up the ROP Drums and Ensembles Patch at the initialization stage has the Close Mic’s gain at the mid-point of the mix knob while the Stage Mic is gradually less and the Hall Mic ever more so. This is a recommended starting point from the developer to achieve a nice orchestral balance. The setting noted here has a more dry but no less detailed timbre than what we are used to from recent percussion libraries. Once I increased the gain on the overall patch (-6db to unity gain) as well as the gain on the Close Mic, the level of detail and body on the Bass Drum was easily more apparent.</p>
<p>The inclusion of a heavy mix on both the Stage and Hall Mics can easily push the library towards “Epic” territory (along with a boatload of processing) if that’s what the user desires. I found the core orchestral elements could suit my needs quite well. The only instrument that left me wanting a bit “more” out of this group was the Timpani. The timbre and playability responds nicely but the overall dynamic range had me wanting a bit more on the upper velocity layers. This is also a completely subjective opinion and the inclusion of an instrument of this scope in an already extensive package is a great bonus.</p>
<p>The Auxiliary Instruments along with the Cymbals, Gongs Tubular Bells and Crotales all play and sound fantastic. Lets face it, with a percussion library we want to “play” the instrument. Pounding away through the round robins at each dynamic level show a very strong attention to detail in the editing of the samples, making a realistic and fun result to playing these patches. The Hand Drums lend themselves to this extremely well and are a pleasure to play. The Marimba, Xylophone and Glockenspiel have all been captured very well and the tonality and playability is certainly on par with the rest of the library. The flexibility of the Mic Positions allow you to place these instruments in as intimate or as large a setting as needed.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts and Impressions</h2>
<p>My final thoughts on Rhapsody can be summed up into these 3 points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Impact Soundworks set out to develop an Orchestral Percussion Library that was of high quality and content but was ultimately more focused on malleability and workflow. Did they succeed? Yes.</li>
<li>The sheer amount of instruments included is impressive and with no corners cut.</li>
<li>The price point for the full library is an absolute steal and makes this an attractive option for both newcomers and more tenured users that may have already invested in another option(s). This library can no doubt add to what you may already have in your arsenal.</li>
</ul>

Deane and Brian return from a two month break to chat with acclaimed Hollywood composer and orchestrator Conrad Pope about his life in music, his long-standing working relationship with John Williams, and his experience on this summer&#8217;s monster hit, Godzilla. Conrad also offers his thoughts on the Los Angeles musicians union saga, his first ever film score job, <em>The Rocketeer</em>, and how MIDI can positively or negatively affect a film score. Deane and Brian also squeeze in a discussion on the very prickly subject of the value of your reputation as a private person versus your reputation as a professional entity.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[You ain't no Williams… and that's not such a bad thing.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>None of us are the same.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll never have to worry about competing with John Williams. I know what you are thinking: &#8220;No kidding, dude!&#8221;</p>
<p>No, I mean it. John Williams will never sound like you can. He&#8217;ll never sound like me. He&#8217;s not able. You might say, &#8220;Um, Deane, excuse me, but John Williams is arguably the single greatest composer living today. He can do anything.&#8221; To which I would respond, &#8220;Yes he is&#8230; and no he cannot.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Williams can never be Deane Ogden, or James Newton Howard, , or John Debney, or Brian Ralston, or Alexandre Desplat, or Sharon Farber, or Chris Young, or Adrian Ellis, or Hans Zimmer, or Brian Satterwhite, or Richard Bellis, or Tim Montijo, or Alan Silvestri. As long as he has written for the screen, as hard as he might try, as much as he may study, he&#8217;ll never get there. Our music flows from a place that John Williams could never understand or even come close to comprehending. He could not possibly get it and he never will.</p>
<p>Conversely, as hard as <em>we</em> try, as hard as <em>we</em> study, and as hard as <em>we</em> practice, <em>we</em> will never sound like John Williams. John Williams never has to worry you nor I. Why? Because none of us could ever fathom what John Williams had to go through to write his most recent note. We will never know the place John Williams writes from. We don&#8217;t <em>get</em> him, and we never ever will.</p>
<p>We are all different people with different lives, different sets of experiences, born of different parents, facing radically different futures. Therefore, <em>competition</em>, at least in the form by which we usually refer to it, doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>People talk about <em>competition</em> all the time. I hear constantly from players how hard it is to compete with the convenience of samples (not the <em>quality</em> of them&#8230;. the <em>convenience</em> of them!). Of course, we all have experienced competition within our own ranks, being put up against each other by our own representative agencies for projects, always with that same reassurance from them, &#8220;Hey don&#8217;t worry… this one&#8217;s got YOU written all over it!&#8221; Uh huh.</p>
<p>Professional golfers say often that there is no competition amongst their tribe, but rather only that which exists between each golfer and the golf course itself. To a pro golfer, the other golfer on the course is not the competitor, but the curve of a fairway or the placement of a hazard. I&#8217;ve always found that concept fascinating and I&#8217;ve often pondered how it might apply to our situation as music and film Creatives. There really is no one entity in the film music community that you need ever have to worry about competing with, save for one&#8230; your own <em>music</em>. Yes, the most fierce competition out there that you&#8217;ll face as a composer is the last score you wrote. Your true nemesis resides right there, in the pit of your own stomach—the drive to better yourself. To set a goal, achieve it, set a loftier goal, achieve that, and so on, and so forth. Creatives have it in their guts to up their own ante. As Creatives, we are our own fiercest competition, our own worst enemies.</p>
<p>Creatives are different than other people. It&#8217;s politically correct to say that we aren&#8217;t—that we are just like construction workers, attorneys, corporate buyers, or police officers—but when you get honest about it, we most certainly AREN&#8217;T like any of those people. We are a different animal. We don&#8217;t think, analyze, opine, or expend our energy the way non-creatives do. We also don&#8217;t rest, work, vacation, engage, or &#8220;unplug&#8221; the way that non-creatives do. We rarely ever stop creating, whether we are writing at our workstations or writing in our heads at the dinner table. We often get accused of not being &#8220;present&#8221; during conversations or engaged in our surroundings (sound familiar?). We daydream a lot. We also have a greater need for solitude and seclusion and often are told that we lean towards being &#8220;reclusive&#8221;. By all counts, we are simply <em>different</em>. And what drives us is different, also.</p>
<p>Creatives are <em>driven</em> in a way that no other human tribe is. We are driven to create, yet in that process of creating—when we are really <em>down in it</em>— composers in particular tend to lose track of something that is vital to long-term success: Self-Improvement. So many composers—even the A-listers who some view as &#8220;leading the pack&#8221; in terms of pushing the boundaries of the craft—rely on their same old bag of tricks, their tried-and-true methods of creating&#8230; the things that have always worked for them. The crutches. The old standards. The &#8220;reliables&#8221;.</p>
<p>It gets worse as you move up the ladder. I recently sat with an A-list composer friend of mine and we talked about the differences between the terraces of the film composing career. We talked about the contrasts of handling 1-2 million dollar studio budgets versus 30-90k indie budgets, managing a team of 25 versus an army of One, and working with our agencies as opposed to negotiating our own deals. But when we started talking <em>creativity</em>, I ask him what the major differences were that he saw between his A-list position and when he first started out as an indie film guy. Here&#8217;s what he said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>&#8220;Deane, when you have done this as long as I&#8217;ve been fortunate to, you develop a sound. And that sound is what you then become known for. Once you have your sound, in a strange way, it&#8217;s over for you creatively. That&#8217;s all they want. That sound. You don&#8217;t get to experiment, they don&#8217;t want you to try anything new. They just want the sound. Then it is up to you. You have to then figure out a way to manipulate that sound—the sound that is YOU—so that it evolves and changes, yet to them, it is still that sound. But to you, it becomes something else. Something different every time. And it&#8217;s always got to be better than the last time, because if it&#8217;s not, then what&#8217;s the point for you? If you aren&#8217;t doing better work each and every time you score a picture, you are cheating yourself and at that point it really is just a service job. It&#8217;s heartless, then. No life. I&#8217;m not saying that&#8217;s easy, Deane. Getting to the point of besting yourself each time out is a hard thing to do, and most composers haven&#8217;t figured out how to do it. But it is possible if you work at it. But that&#8217;s the rub—it takes a lot of patience and a lot of hard work.&#8221;<br />
</em></p>
<h1>The Passion to Be <em>You</em></h1>
<p>Finding your own voice or sound can be daunting at best and impossible at worst. Is it something you can just conjure up, or must it come to you organically, born out of doing film music for long periods of time? Who knows. It&#8217;s probably different for everybody. But certainly, the commonality exists that you must be conscious of it before you set out to be original. In doing so, however, be careful not to set out to be different from everyone else. If you do, you&#8217;ll be looking at others more than you should be. When you focus too much on outside factors, you begin to lose track of what you are trying to accomplish in your own craft.</p>
<p>Exerting effort to be better than the next person will get you nowhere. Well, that&#8217;s not entirely true; it will get you somewhere, but <em>somewhere</em> is a place that you won&#8217;t like very much. Better to concentrate instead on besting yourself. You&#8217;ll never be better than John Williams at what he does. Williams is the best Williams there is. You&#8217;ll never do Tom Newman better than Tom Newman does Tom Newman. I&#8217;m not talking about not having to &#8220;live up&#8221; to the temp, or having to create something with the same vibe as what the director has been infatuated with since the beginning of post. In fact, I believe that &#8220;temp love&#8221; is less about the music and more about the feeling of the scene. (There has never been a situation in my own career when I wasn&#8217;t able to talk the director off the steep cliff of &#8220;recreating the temp&#8221;. It&#8217;s easy to do if you can articulate how the music is not really the issue—the scene is.)</p>
<p>What am I suggesting? Am I saying that competition isn&#8217;t productive? Of course not. What I&#8217;m saying is that competing against <em>yourself</em>, allowing your <em>own</em> brand of greatness to slowly unfold, is better than buzzing harder to keep up with the swarm.</p>
<p>Allow <em>your</em> music to do the talking. <!-- WP Biographia v4.0.0 --></p>

In our 43rd episode, Deane and Brian hold court during a 90-minute discussion with guest composers Panos Kolias and Oliver Sadie on achieving a healthy balance between composing, raising kids, being around for the family and having a life of your own. Also, in a rare unhinging, Deane lets the expletives fly as he collides with Brian over a controversial composing contest that has had the Internet trolls spitting and frothing for weeks. Finally, at the top of the show, David Saunders (Director of Global Community for SCOREcast) announces the details on the new <em>SCOREcast: TORONTO</em> Community Chapter!</p>
<p><strong>WARNING: We believe this episode on family issues and work/life balance to be one of the best in the history of our show. We also realized in editing that it&#8217;s probably our most R-rated. So, consider yourselves warned — we don&#8217;t edit for language. If you have children within earshot, we recommend waiting until you can strap on the cans before listening to this particular episode. Thanks! — D&amp;B</strong></p>

In the first episode of 2014, Deane and Brian sit down with orchestrator, music programmer and overall technical guru James Sizemore, who has been Howard Shore&#8217;s right-hand man since 2008. The boys delve into how James and Shore worked with visionary director Peter Jackson to bring the Hobbit films to the screen and what goes into collaborating on a cultural phenomenon that, when finished, will occupy the better part of five years for all involved. Additionally, the guys call BS on an article that appeared in The Guardian wherein a claim was made that &#8220;synths are killing&#8221; the film industry, as well as a discussion of a roundtable which focussed on having a &#8220;voice&#8221; as a composer and dealing with difficult directors.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A library in reverse? The description may raise a skeptical eyebrow or two, but REV turns out to be an extraordinary library from a new kid on the block who instantly acquires respect. Guy Rowland takes you through the particulars.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>REV</strong> by <a title="Output" href="http://outputsounds.com" target="_blank">Output</a><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit I was skeptical. An entire library based around the concept of reversing stuff? <em>Gimmicky, one trick pony and probably redundant anyway</em>, I mumbled to myself. It&#8217;s not hard to reverse stuff, and you only need it for a few odd bits of effects anyway. Just a bit of PR spin and some flashy graphic design, I thought. Sheesh.</p>
<p>And then I played it.</p>
<p>What an extraordinary library it has turned out to be, from a brand new developer who instantly acquires respect and admiration. This is a library that has arrived from apparently nowhere, fully formed, is highly useful and also beautifully produced and engineered. I can barely level a criticism at it, in fact, and far from it being good only for occasional effects, it&#8217;s somehow managed to make itself very broad and genuinely useful on a day to day basis. The real question is – how did they make it so good from such an unpromising concept?</p>
<h2>ENGINE</h2>
<p>REV is a Kontakt Player library and it requires 5.3 to run (the library won&#8217;t work on 5.2.x). Download and installation is via Continuata – I&#8217;ve had more than my fair share of problems with Continuata in the past, but it downloaded the 6.5gb library hitch-free. Not the fastest on the block, but no slouch either.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2130" src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/REV-Timed_Instruments_02.png" alt="REV-Timed_Instruments_02" width="632" height="416" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/REV-Timed_Instruments_02.png 632w, ../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/REV-Timed_Instruments_02-389x256.png 389w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" /></p>
<h2>PATCHES</h2>
<p>The first thing that strikes you is the apparent lack of patches – <em>four</em>, to be precise. But as their names suggest, this is very much the tip of the iceberg, since each nki is actually a core container for literally hundreds of different patches. There are Instruments, Loops, Rises and Timed Instruments (a variation on basic Instruments where samples are loaded into RAM for smooth time-stretching).</p>
<p>Starting with Instruments, the first place to go is the instrument browser, which has subfolders for Fundamentals, Simple and Complex Pads, Pulses, Swells, Plucked, ReTron, Simple (basic reverses), Sling, Sound Design, Stutter One Shots, Aggressive, Percussive and User Presets. Each of these contain dozens of patches, so you quickly realize that this is a vast library indeed.</p>
<p>Things start off much as you might expect – some cool, very well executed reverse patches that evoke modern soundtracks like Breaking Bad or quality documentaries (er, not the Discovery Channel kind!). Then quickly you realize that the reversed angle can be very subtle, even not really noticeable in many cases. There&#8217;s an organic quality to a lot of the sounds, which is very pleasing – it has one foot in the land of the real, and it rarely sounds electronic (except for the pulses, which are deliberately not organic). The simple pads are instantly playable  and mostly based around real instruments (piano, guitars, cello, clarinet etc). They typically evoke the instrument that they are derived from, but its staggering how far the basic reverse concept appears to take things. Often it sounds more frozen than reversed – there&#8217;s plenty of patches without that distinctive sharp reversed end. And yet they always sound lifelike, with movement that makes it sound real if slightly other-worldly. The ReTron section takes it further, with a sharp attack and no release, while the slings play tricks such as starting forwards and then reversing at the mid-point.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2131" src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/REV-Rises_01.png" alt="REV-Rises_01" width="632" height="416" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/REV-Rises_01.png 632w, ../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/REV-Rises_01-389x256.png 389w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" /></p>
<h2>USER INTERFACE</h2>
<p>With any patch loaded, you&#8217;ll now be able to manipulate it using the excellent and intuitive interface. There are on/off switches for lo-fi, rage (distortion), stack (amp sim), filter, delay, reverb and EQ, and clicking on the names gives you access to the controls. The instrument patches are made up of two layers, each with stutter (volume and pitch) sections, the overall filter and envelope ADSR along with layer volume, pitch and pan, while loops and rises have just the one layer (with the same controls). It&#8217;s staggeringly easy to just dive and and tweak a sound beyond all recognition – the controls are all well chosen.</p>
<h2>LOOPS AND RISERS</h2>
<p>Reversed sounds and riser effects typically arrive with a bunch of problems that get slapped in your lap. If you&#8217;re playing a chord with that classic reversed end of note, the tails will typically end at different times for each note, resulting in an ugly mess which destroys the effect. Not so here – the library has been painstakingly designed to eliminate this nastiness completely – all the notes time themselves to end at the right point. And as for rises, which might be hit and miss to get to end at a hit point, the best solution until now is to find the source WAV and plonk it onto the timeline, lining it up by eye. This isn&#8217;t possible here, as the samples are contained in locked monoliths, but they go one better: You can chose how many bars you want your riser to stretch across, with or without a tail. Brilliant – no more endless juggling around the piano roll making your riser time correctly. Also useful, there&#8217;s also half/double-speed options for the loops and risers.</p>
<p>Speaking of loops and risers, these sections are every bit as versatile as the instruments. The same acoustic instrument-based stuff is there and complemented with high, mid and low pulses, percussion, cymbals, shakers etc. In all of these, the keyboard is split, with the lower part controlling pitch and the upper 2 octave&#8217;s worth of variations which can be performed, combined and layered.</p>
<p>Kudos to Output for  knocking their debut release way, way out of the park. Admittedly I&#8217;ve only scratched the surface of the huge treasure trove it contains, but honestly there&#8217;s nothing I can find fault with. Nothing. The library is vast, top quality, diverse, inspiring, usable and tweakable. Often you find yourself waiting for a 1.1 of the library to get the gremlins ironed out or expand on the range of options – in this case I find myself realizing that 1.0 just works brilliantly and instead I take to wondering how on earth they can top it for whatever they library release next.</p>

<p>What kind of &#8220;professional&#8221; walks out on a film set to start production in less than two weeks?James Franco does, that&#8217;s who. That&#8217;s right. After already spending half a million on pre-production just weeks away from shooting, James Franco pulled out of GARDEN OF LAST DAYS, a film he was directing and starring in. The reason? According to Mike Flemming at <em>Deadline Hollywood:</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Franco’s exit had to do with a disagreement with financier Millennium over the crew he wanted to hire. Basically, Franco put together a crew that didn’t &#8220;have the experience&#8221; to get approval from the bond company. Millennium wouldn’t approve his choices.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>There are a couple different ways to interpret what happened. I realize we are armchair quarterbacking this and not privy to exactly what happened. But think about it with me for a moment. One possible scenario is that Millennium just did not want to do the project any more out of their fear it would lose money and they quietly, under the table, told the bond company to not approve the crew. This would allow them to save the relationship with their star Franco and blame the film not happening on the faceless bond company. That is a possibility. Also&#8230;I am told the bond company does not really care if the film is good&#8230;just if the film can be done on the budget laid out. It is possible the $3M budgeted was certain to go way over budget and the crew assembled did not have the experience to navigate a tight budget. They most likely met with everyone they would have been concerned about&#8230; and discovered the way they are wanting to shoot, there would be no way they were going to only spend $3M. The bond company estimation could have been much higher to finish the film Franco wanted to make and so determined his crew didn&#8217;t know how to be efficient with their choices. That is also possible for sure. But part of me thinks something else may be going on.</p>
<p>James Franco is a rather talented guy who has shown his talent both in front of and behind the camera. He also is someone in this industry who I would consider to be a true &#8220;artist&#8221;. I have always felt he is creating art when he works. He takes chances. He works on both indies and Blockbusters. He breaks barriers. And he has also finally earned the respect of many in Hollywood as an &#8220;A-list&#8221; actor. There is little doubt he knows what he is doing when it comes to making a successful film. So why would a studio/bond company trust him enough to hire him as a director, but not trust his choices for his crew?</p>
<p>I was speaking with a director/producer friend of mine.  He is an active AMPAS member, respected by his peers, and use to be a studio executive in addition to his producing work. So he has been on both sides of the process of making and releasing a film. He knows what he is talking about. He shared with me a profound concept that explains how to interpret what is going on in Hollywood here. And he learned it from Hal Prince, an American theatrical producer and director who has worked on many of the best-known Broadway musical productions of the past 50 years. Hal has garnered twenty-one Tony Awards, more than any other individual, including eight for directing, eight for producing the year&#8217;s Best Musical, two as Best Producer of a Musical and three special awards. Cabaret, West Side Story, Cats, Evite, Phantom Of The Opera. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Hal said there is a difference between a &#8220;Hit&#8221; &amp; a &#8220;Flop&#8221; and a &#8220;Success&#8221; &amp; a &#8220;Failure.&#8221; One set of terms has to do with money&#8230;the other does not.</p>
<p>A <em><strong>hit</strong></em> makes money. Lots of money.<br />
A <em><strong>flop</strong></em> does not.</p>
<p>A <em><strong>success</strong></em> is not tied to money but whether if it is successful in what it set out to do. (Tell a compelling story, entertain, etc&#8230;)<br />
A <em><strong>failure</strong></em> is unsuccessful in completing its goals.</p>
<p>How does this apply to Hollywood today? Many might argue that Hollywood is more concerned these days about having &#8220;hit films&#8221; than it is about creating film successes. A hit does not necessarily have to be a successful film. In fact, I would argue many hits today are not very successful films. How many times have you gone to see the latest blockbuster film and left the theater saying to yourself, &#8220;that was just not a good film.&#8221; And yet it made millions at the box office opening weekend. It was a hit. But as a film&#8230;it was a failure. Disney&#8217;s <em>John Carter</em> is a recent example many considered to be in the flop category. They did take a $200M write down on the film after all and Rich Ross resigned from his position at Disney over it.</p>
<p>On the contrary, there are many films that were extremely successful, but flops at the box office. Going back a bit into the 90&#8217;s, <em>Pleasantville</em> completely changed how the industry worked in Post-Production. A change still in effect today.  It was the first film to use a Digital Intermediate throughout the entire Post process for its groundbreaking color effects. Previous to this, the digital intermediate was used sparingly for FX shots only. Most people I know love the film and all of those associated with the film are very well-respected in Hollywood for their work on that film. It was truly a success in everything it set out to do and changed Hollywood for the better. But financially at the box office it was actually a flop.</p>
<h2>A New Paradigm</h2>
<p>We have to recognize that the financiers and studios today are much more interested in hits than successes. Despite his proven track record of success in film, Franco still could not get his chosen crew to get approved on this little $3 million dollar indie film. This is not hundreds of millions of dollars we are talking about here, but a very low budgeted $3M indie. And Millennium Films, according Deadline Hollywood, would apparently not approve his flop of a crew. Reading between the lines, I keep coming back to the thought that just because some on the crew had not made a $100M dollar hit film, does that necessarily mean they don&#8217;t know what they are doing on a $3M indie film? No. It doesn&#8217;t. The next Tariq Anwar (Editor &#8211; <em>The King&#8217;s Speech, American Beauty</em>), Freddie Young (Cinematographer &#8211; <em>Lawrence Of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago</em>) or Jerry Goldsmith could be among that young crew.</p>
<p>I continue to speculate here, but does anyone really think James Franco would be putting a crew together for a film he was reportedly passionate about that could not pull off what he wanted to do with this little indie? I don&#8217;t. I think the true artist in James was putting together the exact crew perfect to make THAT film&#8230;and yet because some of them were not on the Millennium short list of dept. heads in town, the financiers and bond company (who are experts at the numbers game and not artists and filmmakers) got nervous and began to butt heads with Franco. They did not trust him and his directing choices and probably lost interest in the project and were concerned it would be a flop.  Whether Millennium put the bond company up to not approving the project or not, we will never know. But Franco, out of true loyalty to his film&#8217;s vision and his chosen crew that he believed in, simply walked away. Proving to those around him that there is more to this business than making a hit.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong: The hits <em>are</em> important. They help the studio&#8217;s fund other productions. They <em>must</em> have hits. But if Hollywood is going to start making successful original films again, the films that will become iconic and remembered for generations to come, it is going to have to stop putting a &#8220;hit requirement&#8221; on everything it produces and take more chances across the board on both original stories and young, talented people. Especially the $3M indies like Franco&#8217;s GARDEN OF LAST DAYS and other &#8220;entry-level films&#8221; that are the proving grounds for the future generation of filmmakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&#8230;as composers..how does this apply to us,&#8221; you ask? Well, if you have never had a &#8220;hit&#8221; film&#8230;that does not mean you are not a successful composer. It does not mean you don&#8217;t know what you are doing or talking about. It means the folks out there that may be saying that are confused about the difference between a hit &amp; a flop and a success &amp; a failure. They are not the same. They are exclusive of one another. As a composer, you need to simply focus on making every film score you work on a success and stop worrying about whether it is attached to a hit. Does your music make the film better? Does it do its job well? Did you write a successful score? That is what you should be focusing on.</p>
<p>Hal Prince had it right.</p>
