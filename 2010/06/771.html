Instead of emailing my answer, I thought it would be a great topic to bring up here at SCOREcast:</p>
<blockquote><p>“With all of the commitments you have pulling at you, how do you decide which projects to work on and which to leave on the table?”</p></blockquote>
<p>GREAT question. Not an easy one to answer—because everyone is different—but an important one to answer, nonetheless. I’ll give it a shot.</p>
<p>We are all busy people. Some of us have two, three, four, ten, thirty things going at once. I’m scoring three movies simultaneously right now, I oversee SCOREcastOnline.com, I lead a successful, healthy, and happy team at Deane Ogden Music, my home life kicks ass, I rarely miss lunch with the woman of my dreams, and I still have plenty of time to play drums on people’s records. You all have your set of plates to spin as well, and somehow, we all find the time to make it happen. Many of you have children at home, and that pushes the time management into a whole other stratosphere that those of us who are kid-less can’t even imagine.</p>
<p>So, what happens when you are offered that gig that will tip the scales? You want to take it, but you know if you do, your carefully balanced life will come crashing down around you in the form of unhappy family members, unfulfilled obligations, and sometimes, music that is not up to your quality standard. Do you take that gig and just figure out a way to fit it in with all the other things that you have going? Do you drop one thing for a while to make room for the new one? Maybe the one that is the most financially rewarding should take pole position in your schedule. After all, it’s all about earning, right?</p>
<p>Well… hang on a sec.</p>
<p>Here is how I’ll tackle this: I’ll start by telling you what I’ve heard *other people* say when I have asked this question. Some of these answers I agree with, and others I do not. However, all of them speak to something important about creativity and how you should spend your time, and I think there are valuable kernels of truth wrapped in each one. Then I’ll give you my personal take on how to spend that all-too-precious and under-abundant creative capital.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT OTHERS DO</strong><br />
Over the years, I&#8217;ve posed the above mentioned question to many of my own mentors. There seems to be two distinct answers that are popular with almost all of the composers I have asked: <em>&#8220;Take Every Gig&#8221;</em> followed quickly with, <em>&#8220;&#8230;Unless It Doesn&#8217;t Pay!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s examine the benefits and drawbacks of both of these suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>“Take Every Gig”</strong><br />
We’ve *all* heard this from a lot of composers who know what’s up.</p>
<p><em>ADVANTAGES</em>: You never truly know where any gig will lead—larger gigs with that person in the future, connections you’ll meet on that gig that will benefit you later, or accolades the gig will bring either as a result of your direct involvement (your music) or as a result of the finished product (the show). The cornerstone concept of “taking every gig” is that this business is , at its most basic, a numbers game. The more shows you work on, the better chance your work has of being heard/seen, which heightens community awareness and helps to build your reputation of kicking ass, as well as your personal brand. If you take this tact, you’ll probably work more often than if you didn&#8217;t. In addition, it’s probably the best way to connect with others quickly who are looking to hire a composer for their show.</p>
<p><em>DISADVANTAGES</em>: You’ll work on a lot of crappy projects. The bad part of “the numbers game” is that you get what you get, beggars can’t be choosers… all that stuff. Yes, you’ll get known, but who wants to be “known” for shitty films that look like they were made by idiots? While it’s true that the director usually takes the fall for the final product, you still don’t want to be known as the person who works on clunkers. Having said that, for every homer Babe Ruth hit, he struck out twice… so in the long run, <em>taking every gig</em> could be the winning strategy.</p>
<p><strong>“…Unless It Doesn’t Pay!”</strong><br />
<em>Not</em> doing a gig unless it pays is an extremely popular approach… but mostly with the top 10% earning film composers. Go figure. The other thing about this mantra is that the person who shouts it the loudest is also usually the same person who will take the call right after yours for a non-paying gig. It’s sort of a double standard. Like, the principle of getting paid is important, but does anybody *really* follow that principle? Not really.</p>
<p>The problems inherent in this philosophy are immediately obvious. Whether it&#8217;s filet mignon or hot dogs, you have to eat. On the other hand, who would pass up an opportunity to work on something that has alternative long-range benefits? Are you going to tell USC&#8217;s next Spielberg to &#8220;bite you&#8221; if he has no money? Exactly… me neither.</p>
<p><em>ADVANTAGES</em>: When you charge for your work, you quickly establish a “perceived value” on your work AND your time. People will begin to say, “He/she is amazing&#8230; and worth every penny.” Being <em>worth</em> hiring for the price you command is NEVER a bad thing. If you stick to your guns, you’ll almost automatically put yourself in a higher tier than most composers, because, let’s face it…. most composers will do anything for any price these days. If you manage to build a reputation for being known as someone who does killer, top-quality work with zero hassles… but you cost a little more… most producers worth their salt are willing to at least hear you out. At that point, it’s up to you and your sales skills to close the deal on why spending a little more to get a LOT more is the better way for them to go.</p>
<p><em>DISADVANTAGES</em>: The veritable glut of composers who are willing to work for no compensation at all completely screws you in a high-demand market. I’ve never been a believer in the idea that there are more composers than there is work. I just don’t buy that in our day and age of new media. The aforementioned problem of composers being willing to do things for free far outweighs the amount of them that are employable in this town. On the other hand, there are producers out there that only value film music as a commodity, and therefore will settle for a &#8220;score&#8221; that is mediocre at best. In that case, holding out for payment could make you more of a <em>pain in the ass</em> than a <em>team player</em> in the eyes of some producers.</p>
<p>But here is my take on it: We work in what I like to refer to as a “tiered system”. The kind of filmmaker I like to work with is not the person who is looking to skimp on a score. In every job I’ve ever held, it has been important for me to be able to respect the person that was my overseer. I could never have respect for someone who doesn’t appreciate what we do, yet calls themselves a filmmaker. A director’s or producer’s sense of what is valuable speaks volumes to me and will be a huge determining factor in whether I even take the job or not. Conversely, there are composers out there (you might be one of them) who are willing to work for someone who places little-to-no value on their work. If that’s you&#8230; good luck with all that.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT I DO</strong><br />
Before I tell you what my own personal guidelines are for picking and choosing projects, let me give you a slightly different take on the above two &#8220;Golden Rules&#8221;. I believe, to a point, that each of those rules hold merit, but I also think there is a better way to execute them. Said differently, I have some &#8220;funk of my own&#8221; to dress them up with:</p>
<p><strong>“<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Take</span> Consider Every Gig”</strong><br />
I don’t take everything, but I certainly *consider* everything.</p>
<p>Last Friday, I received an email from a producer who is shooting a film in London this summer, and he likes my work. He’s sending me the script to read, and he wants to know my thoughts on it. (A note about scripts: In general, I don&#8217;t place a lot of value on scripts. I&#8217;ve found that scripts become more and more meaningless to a composer once a director gets involved, since that person is going to inevitably bring fresh vision and make it his or her own anyway.) I agreed to read this one because the idea is so unique.</p>
<p>The point? I may not take this film… but I&#8217;m certainly going to review it, read it, talk with the principals, and then make the decision. I CONSIDER EVERYTHING.</p>
<p>Am I in a unique position to pick and chose projects as I please? Am I so successful that I have that luxury? The answer to that is the same as it is for everyone else… sometimes yes, sometimes no. It just so happens that this summer, I can be a little choosy. But regardless of that, even if I couldn&#8217;t possibly shoehorn one more thing into my schedule, I&#8217;ll consider it anyway. Why? Because you never know what is going to happen in this business. Movies start up strong, and die with a whimper all the time. Schedules move, re-shoots happen, plans get scraped, post-production gets moved to freaking Ireland… whatever.</p>
<p>My point is that nothing is ever set in stone. I mean, my God&#8230; we are talking about “movies”!! For you to put all of your eggs in one basket is not only stupid, it’s just poor business. You wouldn’t do that if you were a construction worker, attorney, doctor, athlete, food service worker, or retail manager… so why do it as a composer?</p>
<p>Talk to EVERYONE. Read EVERY SCRIPT. Follow up on EVERY LEAD. Consider EVERYTHING, no matter how small it is. You just never know.</p>
<p><strong>“<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Unless It Doesn’t Pay!</span> &#8230;Unless It Doesn&#8217;t Pay SOMETHING!”</strong><br />
Most people think of the word “payment” purely in monetary terms. They need money, so they view every possible project as a cash-in-pocket opportunity. This is where I think most emerging film music professionals go horribly wrong.</p>
<p>When I lecture to film music students at universities, I do an entire segment on “Getting Paid”, but I don’t mention *money* one time throughout the presentation. Why? Because money is only one in a thousand ways to get compensated for scoring a film. Granted, it is still THE BEST way, but it certainly isn’t the <em>only</em> way.</p>
<p>When you are first getting started, your level of participation in this game is most likely to be on par with the same level at which your director and producer are participating. Translation: If you have eight roommates and thrive on ramen noodles, chances are the kinds of people that you’ll soon be working with do too. It’s not really fair to participate at a level where there is no money to be made, yet expect a large payment anyway. The first realization you need to come to when starting out is that you are at a level of the game that requires you to be VERY honest with yourself and not get your expectations too high. Mark my words: You will not get rich quickly doing this. It is utterly impossible at the level you are operating at. To go a bit further, you aren’t even going to be making enough to be <em>comfortable</em>, let alone <em>rich</em>, so just do yourself a favor and get that out of your head right now. Accept that that is where you are on the ladder of the business, and work towards climbing higher with every opportunity.</p>
<p>Any good financial analyst will tell you that the true measure of a person’s wealth is not their cash-flow—it is, rather, measured by their liquid and non-liquid <em>assets</em>. <em>Assets</em>, in the world of high-finance, are &#8220;Any item of economic value owned by an individual or corporation, especially that which could be <em>converted to cash</em>.&#8221; In film composer terms, you need certain assets to get this job done. Since many of those assets are essential for the work we do, you’d be a long shot for the job at all if you don’t have them in place. Examples include, but are not limited to, reliable transportation, a functional computer, sound sources (sample libraries, instruments, etc.), an internet connection, a place to work (home or offsite studio), method of communication (cell phone, home phone, email, Skype, etc.), software (DAW, mixing set-up, plugins, utilities, etc.)… this list could go on and on, depending on your particular needs and goals.</p>
<p>Each of the things I mentioned above are parts of your asset portfolio, and they are what make up your true wealth. Best case scenario, when you need to acquire an additional asset to fulfill your duties as a composer, you simply go out and buy whatever that asset is. However, when you have no money, this becomes impossible. If you have no money coming in, but you have a lot of product (read: music) going out, then your business is operating at a loss. The deeper that loss gets, the tougher it is getting to the point of a return profit.</p>
<p>This is where I believe your ability to negotiate comes into play. The truth is that no matter WHAT they say to you, if someone just made a movie… THEY HAVE RESOURCES. Making a movie only works if you are able to wrangle the resources to pull it off. In fact, that is the definition of <em>producer</em>—“One who produces.” If a producer fails to produce compensation for the composer, then, essentially, they are not <em>producing</em>. It is by that rational that when a producer tells you they have no money, your response should always be, “What <em>do</em> you have?” If they are the producer, then they have <em>something</em>. And probably <em>multiple somethings</em>, at that! They might have a Mac Pro that was used in editing that nobody needs now. They might have a family member that runs Fry’s Electronics (God… wouldn’t *that* be great!).</p>
<p>Aside from spec’ing a cue here and there to audition for something (which I have zero problem doing, by the way… what the hell <em>else</em> would I be doing?), I’ve never <strong><em>not</em></strong> gotten something for my work. One time, I was tapped to score an animated visual presentation for a Warner Bros. feature film. Of course, since the producers were pitching the project independently, funds were low, if not non-existent, and I was asked if I would consider the project if they promised to take me with them if the film found funding.</p>
<p>Having heard that story before, I asked the executive producer over lunch, “Okay, well, if you do not have a budget for music, what <em>do</em> you have?”</p>
<p>After a moment of confused silence, the producer said, “Umm… what do you mean? I told you… we don’t have anything.”</p>
<p>I said, “Who’s buying lunch? You or me?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I got lunch,” he replied.</p>
<p>I said, “So you <em>do</em> have money&#8230; you just don’t have <em>much</em> of it.”</p>
<p>He smiled that smile that I flash at my girlfriend when she catches me eating chocolate when I’m supposed to be on a diet, and said, “Okay, man. You got me!”</p>
<p>Turns out that upon further investigation, this guy’s brother was the West Coast regional manager for Samsung. For months, I had been working in my studio with 17” screens, and drooling over some that had a little more pixel real estate. At $469 a pop, however, my drool didn’t line up with my discretionary income.</p>
<p>I told this producer, “Okay, look… if you can get your brother to float me two 32” Samsung flat-screens, I’ll do this presentation with you guys.”</p>
<p>His eyes lit up, and with the most confident tone I’d heard from him yet, he stuck out his hand and enthusiastically said, “It’s a deal!”</p>
<p>Always, always, ALWAYS get <em>something</em> for every job you do. It doesn’t have to be cash—it would be great if it was—but don’t close your mind to an opportunity just because someone’s dream engine is running on fumes and they are hoping you can help it spark some horsepower.</p>
<p>There are sooo many ways to get paid. Back in the day, I did a thesis film gig for a USC student that thought film music was something he could handle himself. After buying a DAW and an extra computer to dedicate to the scoring process, he failed miserably and decided to get some help. For free, of course. We met, and when he told me he had no money, I asked him where the gear went that he had to buy in order to start scoring.</p>
<p>You can see where this is going, I’m sure. By the end of the day, I was going home with all his notes about the music, a few great ideas in my head, and a two-month-old MacBook Pro with all the fixins!</p>
<p><strong>GUIDELINES FOR TAKING GIGS</strong><br />
After I consider the potential gig and make the decision to pursue a meeting with the principals, my manager gets busy gathering info on the compensation package. While she’s doing that, I also start thinking about a few other things… things that have become my own personal “Ogden-isms” for taking or leaving gigs.</p>
<p>Here are three things I weigh out in my head and heart on EVERY potential project:</p>
<p><em><strong>Is It Cool?</strong><br />
</em>Is the project going to be cool? Is it something that really gets me lit up? Because if it is not something that I instantly get excited about, that means the project would be better served by someone else. I’ve scored enough films to build up an internal compass that tells me whether something is going to be a lot of fun, or a frigging nightmare. Granted, sometimes a project is a lot of fun <em>AND</em> a frigging nightmare, but for me that is a combo I can personally deal with. If I’m having fun, I’m pretty much unstoppable.</p>
<p>I hate short films. They just aren’t my bag. I haven’t scored one since 2006. I think it is because I find it difficult to invest emotionally in characters when I only know them for two minutes. Having said that, one of the projects that’s all-systems-go in my studio at the moment is a short film called “Wolfsbane” for Seattle-based director Matt Wilson. I cannot tell you how FREAKING COOL this short film is and how much I wanted to do it after I saw it. Matt and are having a blast working together, and he’s as much in love with my music as I am with his film, so it’s amazing for all of us.</p>
<p>That coolness factor—the thing that makes you wanna… uuuhh!—is what is key in everything you put your hand to. If it’s not cool, and you are not into the material, it’s going to be a miserable ride.</p>
<p><em><strong>Does It Push Me Creatively?</strong><br />
</em>I know people who work on the same kinds of things over and over and over again. Consequently, their music sounds the same… over and over and over again. I want to always do things that are better or different from what I’ve done before. I will do 100 action films, because I think action films are COOL, but if they do not push me creatively, I’m not interested. We’ve all seen a ton of horror films, and no matter what you think of horror, I’m sure we all agree that when it is done right, it’s a kick in the ass. But boy—when it’s done wrong—there’s nothing worse!</p>
<p>I would work on a great horror flick if one came my way. I’ve turned down more than my fair share of stupid ones, though, and I’ll continue to do so. I want to make films I can stand behind. Not only from a conscience creative perspective, but also in our day and age of the 24-Hour News Cycle, who wants to have something out there that they knew going in was a piece of crap when they signed on?</p>
<p>The real secret behind this is that in order to find projects that push you creatively, you have to find <em>people</em> who push you creatively. More on that <a href="../01/gigs-dont-exist.html" target="_self">here</a>.</p>
<p>And finally,</p>
<p><em><strong>Does It Make Sense for My Career?</strong><br />
</em>Some projects are cool ideas, they look like something that might push me to a new place in my writing that I’ve not gone before&#8230; but they just don’t make sense for my career. More often than not, these kinds of pictures tend to be independent productions. By that I mean something that might be independent at the core, but lacks any oversight at all by a studio or distributor. Often, the level of production on an indie pic doesn’t bury the needle as it should or could without the chutzpah of a studio, and therefore, I’m able to be easily confident about bowing out.</p>
<p>On the other hand, while a project may not make sense for <em>my</em> career, that doesn’t necessarily mean that I’ll let it go. I like to keep things in the family. I have a terrific support staff that works with me here in my Musicave. Part of my personal mission is to successfully mentor and lead the team that works hard for me day in and day out. That includes using my position and resources to help them along on their journey every chance I get.</p>
<p>If a project doesn’t make sense for <em>me</em>—maybe it’s too small, underfunded, or just plain <em>wrong</em> for me creatively—it might fit the aesthetics of my assistant or one of my interns. They are all constantly looking for ways into the business other than carving stems on my cues, and what better way for them to gain entrance than for me to hand them a gig that they can take full credit and payment on.</p>
<p>Being a leader is about empowering your people, and removing obstacles that keep them from being at their best. Whatever you have to do to do that is what you <em>have</em> to do to do that. Consider your team when you make choices about projects. They are looking to you for help as much as you are relying on theirs.</p>
<p>—————</p>
<p>In closing, deciding where to spend your creative capital can be a delicate balance of needs versus wants. I’ve written close to 4,000 words here, and yet I’ve really only scratched the surface of what one could consider on this topic. I’d love to hear YOUR thoughts on how you decide what to work on and what not to work on. I’ll be following this thread over the next few weeks. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>COMMENTS are open below</em></span>. Let’s hug it out!!</p>

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-57453775" class="dsq-comment-message">Hey everyone!<br><br>Taking an ear break this AM to check in here and see where the discussion has gone. :oP<br><br>@Ryan—On deferred payment... I, too, have never seen a penny from either deferred payment arrangements or from the well-intentioned yet misguided "percentage of sale" promises that some filmmakers will use to entice you into a partnership. In the indie world especially, the chances of a filmmaker seeing a return on their investment (unless that initial investment is EXTREMELY low) is pretty slim, let alone any leftovers for cast or crew. I find that a better alternative to these types of arrangements (since they basically translate to, "Can you just GIVE me some free music?") is what I suggested in the article: Negotiate something up front, whether material or monetary—preferably monetary.... but if there is no other choice, and the project is calling you, then there has to be SOMETHING that can be worked out.<br><br>@Deb—Hey! Soooo great to see you here! I follow your Tweets religiously. Welcome to the SCO club!<br><br>@David—Hey, man! Thanks for reading and posting... AND for the great email the other day! On your question about "rates"... There are two things I&#39;d consider on this:<br><br>1) First, let&#39;s separate worlds: Indie from Studio. In the Studio world, you never get "asked" what your rate is. The studio let&#39;s your rep know what the package deal budget is, and then you determine from there whether or not you can deliver on that budget. Period. The only time there is any form of "haggling" is if your agent/manager feels like they can squeeze more profit for you from the studio budget and the relationship is there to ask for it. Otherwise, you take it or you leave it. There are plenty of composers.<br><br>In the Indie world, producers are often highly uneducated about what it is we can do for them, not to mention how much it costs to get it done right. It has been my experience that the question "What is your rate?" is one that is usually asked only by first-timers, since seasoned folks know what&#39;s up from the last time they did this. I believe that "What&#39;s your budget?" is not only a completely appropriate question to ask in these situations, but might be the only way to really get even close to what you are worth as the composer.<br><br>On the "10% rule"... again, we have to separate worlds. On studio projects, 10% used to be the rule of thumb for the *entire package*: your fee, recording costs, music prep, orchestration, hall rental, contractor, musicians, conductor... whatever it took for you to deliver the music in finished form at the end of the schedule. So, if a film was a 150-million dollar-budgeted picture, the package would have been 10% of that ($15,000,000). As you can see, 10% of *that* total budget is sort of ridiculous in the day and age of digital music creation. And the studios agree, wholeheartedly, I&#39;m sure. (I&#39;m confirming with a studio exec whether or not the 10% rule was ever *really* a true thing to begin with, or just an old wives&#39; tale... More soon on this, which will clear a lot of this up.)<br><br>In the Indie world, it gets even more silly to assume 10% of the overall budget goes to scoring the film. 10% of what... $500,000? I don&#39;t know an indie filmmaker on earth that would dish out $50k for their score, let alone PLAN to save that much for *anything* in post-production. I would say $5,000 is more likely. Not reasonable... but likely. ;o)<br><br>@Violincaddy—GREAT to see you here! Keep yourself in the convo. It&#39;s an amazing community!</div>

Very instructive, especially regarding the alternate means of "payment."<br><br>I&#39;ve been wondering though, if a director asks you for your "rate" and you reply with "well, what&#39;s your budget," is that something that has the potential to offend or bother them, or is it considered a normal thing to disclose upfront, before your fee is set? If the music budget is generally supposed to be around 10% of the total budget, then being armed with the total figure seems to be a good way to make sure you don&#39;t under or over-sell yourself.</div>

Your idea to ask for real compensation besides money is great and something I will keep in mind for future meetings.<br><br>The first film I ever scored was for deferred payment, and I naively thought that I would magically receive a check in the mail one day.
