				<description><![CDATA[Contemplating moving to Los Angeles for a career in film music? Here are composer Mark Smythe's observations...]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been in Los Angeles since early March 2013 on an Australia Council-funded mentorship program, absorbing all things film music and SoCal: The Good, The Bad and The Bellicose. These are my reflections so far.</p>
<h2>Transit Tantrums</h2>
<p>LA traffic on Thursday afternoon is slower than a George R. R. Martin novel&#8230;and in my case on a shuttle ride, just as gob-smacking when something finally happened. Two young girls in front were chatting excitedly about their impending adventure. Now, they weren&#8217;t exactly shrill but the conversation was audible to all. 40 minutes in, a baby-boomer businessman had an explosive outburst: &#8220;We DON&#8217;T CARE about your banal existence!&#8221;&#8230;stunned silence. A whimpered response. Simmering tension until they were dropped off&#8230;at the same hotel as Mr Explosion and his embarrassed wife. Welcome to Hollywood, girls!</p>
<p>I went to <a href="http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/bmi_participates_in_first_southeast_film_music_symposium" target="_blank">Chattanooga</a> for a weekend, as you do. I had a dawn flight out of LAX so stayed at an airport hotel the night before. Passed the concierge as a man was SCREAMING HIS HEAD OFF at a cab driver for apparently ripping him off all of $9. He kept threatening to call the cops but finally backed down.</p>
<p>On LAX-CHA flight 1, the overhead lockers filled up and a bunch of people had to check their bags through to final destinations, including myself. I didn&#8217;t care; all I needed was my iPad and headphones. Others <em>did care</em> &#8211; airline staff were hammered by well-heeled women with an inflated sense of entitlement, indignant that they wouldn&#8217;t have access to their L&#8217;Oreal travel kits and Xanax.</p>
<p>Then there was the 4-hour delay in Charlotte due to the incoming plane having &#8216;mechanical issues&#8217;. Initially it was 1 hour, then 2&#8230;etc. Was it annoying? Yes. Did it warrant the ageing rocker with a gig that night having an absolute meltdown at the check-in girl, to the point that once again the police were mentioned? NO. I wasn&#8217;t overly happy myself, but would much rather be delayed than fall out of the sky. And for a while there it did feel like the precursor to an episode of &#8216;Air Crash Investigations&#8217;.</p>
<p>SO &#8211; my point is, this was very early into my visit and I was thinking &#8216;holy crap, is this REALLY what Americans are like?&#8217; NO IT ISN&#8217;T. The symposium was FANTASTIC and when I returned to LA, the perpetually warm glow of Angelenos restored my societal faith. I guess travel brings out the best/worst in anyone and I saw some doozies of the latter kind. 99.9% of Americans are nice, genuinely interested in foreigners and usually mean it when they say &#8220;what can I do to help?&#8221;. Embrace that percentile.</p>
<h2>Location/Vehiculation</h2>
<p>Something anyone new to to town should consider carefully, well before landing. Unlike Melbourne, where I could walk 5 minutes to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Fawkner Park or my local cafe strip, LA isn&#8217;t <em>really</em> a city. Rather, it&#8217;s a vast sprawl of mini-cities connected by a web of freeways, each enclave having a unique flavour that may or may not suit your taste. Santa Monica and Venice are renowned for their beach lifestyle and slightly cooler air, but if most of your stuff&#8217;s happening Downtown or in The Valley, you&#8217;ll spend an awful lot of time on the road if you&#8217;re based out west. I knew I&#8217;d be hanging in Studio City/ Hollywood a lot, so took the time to find and pre-book the perfect AirBNB rental, smack in the middle. Slightly pricey but the location definitely saved me time and money. If AirBNB-style pads are beyond your budget, the ubiquitous CRAIGSLIST is a great place to find sub-lets, especially during summer holidays.</p>
<p>Mode of transport is a no-brainer. Unless you have incredibly helpful friends going to Point B (which I actually often do) or don&#8217;t mind spending hours traversing multi Metro routes, <em><strong>you need a car</strong></em>. If you have no choice but to get a cab somewhere, KNOW THIS: They&#8217;ll take at least 20 minutes to turn up, cost a lot and woe betide the passenger that dares to pay by credit card – even if your cab-finder app says it&#8217;s cool. I had a heated argument with a driver about this very point; in the end he was only placated when I tipped cash. If you don&#8217;t want to drive on a night out, a far better option is <a href="http://www.lyft.me" target="_blank">LYFT</a>: a smartphone app that uses your location to find and order a driver in minutes, is 20% cheaper, 100% friendlier and automatically calculates a tip-inclusive fare – ONLY from your credit card. Ok, so they have weird pink moustaches on the cars, but most drivers also stock water and snack treats : )</p>
<h2>LA Flakers — A Few Bad Players or a Team Malaise?</h2>
<p>Much has been said and written about the notoriously slow/complete lack of follow through here in Tinseltown; one friend even suggested that &#8216;yes means maybe, maybe means no and people never say no&#8217;. Hackneyed phrases are quoted with mirth by the cheerfully cynical: “let&#8217;s do lunch” &#8211; ”we&#8217;ll talk” &#8211; etc. Well. I made a conscious decision to ignore the cliché and decide for myself what the deal is. Consequently, I&#8217;ve been very surprised by the reality:</p>
<h3>Those Who&#8217;ve Flaked:</h3>
<p>&#8211; Old Aussie friends now based here, who wanted things from me on a social/industry/material level (they got 2 of the 3) but gave nothing back. Even after I said “You&#8217;re not going to flake on me are you, we will catch up?” I tried to follow up. Twice. We never caught up, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if I suddenly hear from them just before their next gig.<br />
&#8211; Potential new LA friends via Bookface; they were going to &#8216;reach out&#8217; one weekend&#8230;back in March. I tried to follow up. Twice. They de-friended me. Maybe my dry humour was misconstrued when I sent a link to that Four Tops track.</p>
<h3>Those Who Haven&#8217;t Flaked:</h3>
<p>&#8211; New composer friends, including very busy ones working on high-rating shows.<br />
&#8211; Everyone in the industry I&#8217;ve emailed/left a message for, including those I don&#8217;t know that well or haven&#8217;t met yet. I did wait 3 weeks for one reply, but this was a new contact and I time-budgeted accordingly.</p>
<p>So – I&#8217;ve been mildly affected by flakelenos at social level, but industry/music folks have treated me with more than a modicum of politeness and respect. Maybe because I haven&#8217;t burdened myself with unrealistic expectations or exuded the desperate &#8216;I want something from you&#8217; vibe that you can smell a mile away from so many young aspirants. If you come here thinking you&#8217;ll reach the summit straight away, THAT is flakey. Ed Hilary completed his first major climb 13 YEARS before scaling Everest. Patience, persistence and prudence, my friends&#8230;</p>
<h2>Event Etiquette</h2>
<p>Outside of my mentorship with <a href="http://jeffcardoni.com" target="_blank">Jeff Cardoni</a> (CSI:Miami, Wilfred) I&#8217;ve attended a swag (Australian vernacular) of workshops, screenings, seminars and masterclasses. Each event has featured high calibre composers, orchestrators, conductors, directors, or moderators and has been well conceived. Sadly, I can&#8217;t say the same for some of the <em>questions</em> that inevitably slip through the relevance cordon at these things. IT&#8217;S NOT ABOUT YOU! Do you really think that standing up so that everyone can see you when you say &#8220;Hi, my name&#8217;s [wannabe composer X] and I&#8217;ve been working on/done a lot of [gratuitous promo Y] and I work in [DAW Z],&#8221; will make them think <em>&#8220;Wow, I&#8217;m really interested in this guy and what he does, he must write like me because he uses DAW Z&#8221;</em>&#8230;? Truth is, by the time you&#8217;ve got to the actual question, half the room has tuned out (or in my case, head in hands) and the A-lister will remember your face for all the wrong reasons when you push your way through the post-event throng. Then there are those that ask questions just to be &#8216;involved&#8217; and &#8216;seen&#8217;, even if they&#8217;re &#8220;just a songwriter&#8221;&#8230;and you seriously want to punch them when they ask Thomas Newman if he &#8220;scores to picture&#8221;. Or the guy that asked Aaron Zigman if he &#8220;hums ideas in the shower&#8221;. Come on people! Be enthusiastic, but don&#8217;t be a wanker.</p>
<h2>Weeding Out the Tall Poppy</h2>
<p>Australians and New Zealanders are not known for overt self-promotion. In fact, those that say &#8220;I&#8217;m a big deal&#8221; are more often than not regarded as wankers and ostracised by their peers. This is the <strong><em>Tall Poppy Syndrome</em></strong> at work – a &#8216;cut them down&#8217; attitude towards high achievers that is uniquely endemic to Australasia. When I was younger and just out of film music school, I was brimming with enthusiasm; thrilled with any work I could get and any composer I met. Said enthusiasm combined with the mild hero-worship of a composer I spent time with somehow lead to me being perceived as a &#8216;name-dropper&#8217; by a high-ranking person in the Australian film music world. Fast forward four years to the Australian Screen Music Awards, which I was invited to by the organisation this person works for. At an industry lunch prior to the ceremony I made a concerted effort to have a pleasant conversation with this person. But when I told her I was looking forward to the awards, she asked “Are you attending legitimately?”</p>
<p>Happily, my experiences in LA have been the complete opposite. Here, it&#8217;s okay to talk about what you&#8217;ve done, what you&#8217;re doing, who you&#8217;ve connected with and what your aims are. I&#8217;ve been doing so with complete openness and honesty over the last 3 months and have been treated with more respect than I ever was in Australia. In fact, one delightful Executive Director (who holds a comparable position to my antipodean nemesis) now refers to me as her &#8216;favourite Kiwi&#8217;. And you know what? I can write about my awesome night at <a href="http://www.jeffbeal.com" target="_blank">Jeff Beal</a>&#8216;s place without fear of someone telling everybody I&#8217;ve been blowing my own trumpet. I can mention the <a href="http://www.hmmawards.org" target="_blank">Hollywood Music in Media Awards</a> competition I won &#8211; a scoring session with Mr. Beal; helping him record a 25-piece string orchestra. I can say that we exchanged CDs and that he particularly likes my choral stuff.</p>
<p>Los Angeles certainly takes some getting used to, but it&#8217;s so worth it. The top film music people I&#8217;ve met genuinely embrace talent, passion and commitment when they see it.</p>
<p>This, above all, makes me want to stick around.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Your artistic quality has been called into question. And it hurts. Might be true, might not be... but from time to time every artist, no matter the discipline, needs to check the 'ol barometer.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The film music culture over the years has a developed a bit of an elitist complex in the way we talk about the artform, leading some to believe that if you don&#8217;t have little black dots as prevalent as you have red blood cells in your veins then you must not be trying very hard. After all, we were born with this, right? It&#8217;s in our DNA.</p>
<p>Arguable, at best. A lot of people say we were born with certain aptitudes toward this gig but I would argue that while that might be true about musical intuition and a predisposition toward cognitive retention of scales  and other functional repeating mathematical sequences, quality skilled composition only comes out of tireless practice, varied experience and loads of trial and error. It&#8217;s not a far-flung theory then to assume that there could be a serious self-esteem issue working against emerging composers, dare I say even veteran ones who are willing to admit the ugly truth. Are we <em>Weenies</em>? <em>Wimps</em>? <em>Candie-asses</em>? I don&#8217;t think so. But we <em>are</em> human beings and from time to time every artist, no matter the discipline, needs to check the &#8216;ol barometer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>You&#8217;re Not a Bad Composer</h1>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you can&#8217;t seem to write anything today.</strong></h3>
<p>Writer&#8217;s block sucks. But even though the cool thing to say is &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time for that&#8221;, that still doesn&#8217;t mean it never happens. The truth is that it does happen&#8230; to everybody. You aren&#8217;t a bad composer if you are not able to write for whatever reason. You might be a <em>late</em> composer, but you aren&#8217;t a bad one.</p>
<p>How to get rid of it? Studies show that stress is the leading cause of &#8220;mental blocking&#8221; and that eliminating stress-related activities or events in your life can also lower your chances of stalling out creatively. Want to drill down further? Those same studies show that the number one cause of stress, at least among Americans, is <em>finances</em>. If that means something to you&#8230; get on it. Scale back, pare down, save more, spend less, slash and burn, budget hard, charge more — whatever you need to do, but get that financial monkey off your back, and fast. It&#8217;s a killer. Literally.</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you don&#8217;t understand the theories behind music in film.</strong></h3>
<p>It just means you have a few things to learn if you are to be as effective a film music writer as you can be. You might already be an effective composer, but as a film composer you have to intimately understand the marriage of music and drama. If you don&#8217;t, then you are missing a huge piece of the puzzle as a talented composer looking to crack this particular medium. Obviously you aren&#8217;t a bad composer if this skill still eludes you, but I&#8217;ll warn you that without it you are always going to be composing from a <em>defensive</em> posture — meaning that whatever is thrown at you, you&#8217;ll either need to be lucky enough to intuitively feel it and magically hit that bullseye on the first dart throw or you&#8217;ll need to study up every time out, whether that&#8217;s through asking seasoned vets or &#8220;listening&#8221; to seasoned vets via Netflix streaming. Point being, you&#8217;ll always be playing &#8220;catch up&#8221;. That game gets old fast, slows you down, and eventually begins to erode your confidence.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t worry&#8230; it&#8217;s an easy fix. All you have to do is find a way to absorb the principles and theories behind drama. Extended viewing and note-taking can do it, but so will auditing a few film appreciation courses at the local community college. Or reading a stack of good books on the subject. I&#8217;d recommend starting with Earle Hagen&#8217;s <a href="http://amzn.com/0882844474" target="_blank"><em>Advanced Techniques for Film Scoring</em></a>. Hagen&#8217;s book is grossly outdated in its purview of technology, but the score analysis and score/script interaction is second to none. If you really want to steam your head, pick up Fred Karlin&#8217;s classic brick of a book <a href="http://amzn.com/0415941369" target="_blank"><em>On the Track</em></a>. Often referred to as &#8220;the film scoring bible&#8221;, <em>On the Track</em> offers probably the most extensive perspective on various approaches to dramatic writing for the medium of film.</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you&#8217;ve been rejected, fired or ignored. A lot.</strong></h3>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean you suck. Not necessarily, anyway. Although, a case could be made that if you got so far as to pitch for the gig it won&#8217;t matter if you suck anyway because you obviously have what it takes to get through the door. Any well-heeled major player knows <em>that ain&#8217;t easy</em>. But being told that &#8220;your music just isn&#8217;t what we&#8217;re looking for&#8221; is tough. What&#8217;s tougher, though, is hearing that time and again. And even still, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you are a bad composer. You&#8217;ll have to gauge this one for yourself and use your best and most honest evaluations of your output, but there have been plenty of people — hundreds — who&#8217;ve been turned down dozens upon dozens of times before they ever scored a note to picture and even more than that who&#8217;ve been successful and then been told they were washed up, irrelevant, too old, too young, too inexperienced, too expensive, too high-profile, not high-profile enough&#8230; you name it. Point being: Rejection happens and you have to learn to accept it and deal with it appropriately.</p>
<p>There are many ways to face rejection, accept whatever truths come with it, and then discard the parts that don&#8217;t matter. One way is to be sure that you have the most healthy self-esteem you can have outside of your role as a creative person. I married a wonderful woman whom my every heartbeat pounds for. So, I don&#8217;t live every moment to be a composer or to even be a musician. It&#8217;s certainly a gigantic part of who I am at my core, but there are things and people in my life who are more important than any of this will ever be. I&#8217;m not alone in this feeling. Ask anyone who is creative and probably over the age of thirty. The secondary things in life, you realize over time, matter very little. Success takes on a whole new definition when love, children, family, and even the closest friends take root in your life as a middle-aged person. I spend a huge majority of my time trying to hip younger people who are ready to jump off the cliff of career suicide to this fact. When you get rejected, it&#8217;s not a rejection of <em>you as a person</em>, it&#8217;s simply that the timing of your artistic expression and that of the source material don&#8217;t align. That&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s the wrinkle of cosmic scheduling. You could bring the same set of demo cues to the next meeting and have the biggest film in history on your hands. Nobody knows. But whatever the case, rejection should only hit your art, not your heart. It&#8217;s just not worth it and it never ever lasts anyway, so why devote the emotional bandwidth?</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you don&#8217;t know how to read music.</strong></h3>
<p>Clearly, you will be at major and immediate disadvantage if you don&#8217;t read music and you are trying to break into the scene. Not only does this hamper your speed and agility as the point person for the music department on a production, but it will also hurt you as a potential candidate for an apprenticeship — the avenue by which a lot of film composers get their start. Like it or not, and argue all you want, but the film music business still thrives and depends on people who can read dots on a page. Period. Whether you are a musician at a session, an orchestrator sorting out lines for the composer, a copyist handling last-minute changes, or the composer yourself, you will need to read often. Written music comprehension is to a composer what the interpreting of blueprints is to an architect. Not knowing how to read the architectural drawings on the house you are building will be an unmitigated disaster. Imagine being a non-reading composer on the scoring stage and having to quickly change a lead-line for your director, transpose it in your head, and rattle it off to your 1st chair trumpet or clarinetist. Can you imagine? Well, please do&#8230; because that exact scenario is not a rare experience for the in-the-trenches film composer.</p>
<p>Does not reading make you a <em>bad</em> composer? Of course not. Even a few top-tier composers in the game started out just humming their melodies to an orchestrator. But before long, almost all of them learned to read and write at least functionally. Need to brush up? Take some private lessons; there are hundreds of teachers in LA, NYC, and London who will take you on as a private student and bring you up to functional and workable levels in no time. Don&#8217;t be embarrassed by your inability to read notes; not all composers who are working today are ace readers, either, and no matter how good you are, I promise you your musicians will always be ten times better anyway. But even still, having that very basic ability in your skill set will remove what is probably the biggest hurdle to self-confidence as a composer. It is your job as the captain of this ship to have a solid grasp of the fundamentals. This is as fundamental as it gets.</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you don&#8217;t live in a music mecca.</strong></h3>
<p>There you are&#8230; in Delaware. Don&#8217;t worry. Geographical misfortune does not a bad composer make. There&#8217;s been a lot of talk in the last decade about geography and how it correlates to the level of sophistication of a composer, implying that the farther away you are from a major music center the less &#8220;dedicated&#8221; you must be to your craft. Obviously that&#8217;s bullshit. It doesn&#8217;t matter where you live, your talents are your talents. Now, how accessible your talents are to those who need them&#8230; well, that&#8217;s another matter entirely.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re not a <em>bad</em> composer if you live in Cornwall. Still living with the folks in Texarkana? No problem. Never underestimate the powerful combo of a gigabit Internet connection and a fair amount of good old-fashioned hustle. You can accomplish a lot with an IMDbPro account, a well thought-out demo reel and a cell phone. But if you are determined to be in the thick of the film world, the brick and mortar studios are all still standing in Los Angeles. Film and TV seem to be the only industries who haven&#8217;t figured out that the world is flat like the video game industry has. They are making strides in that direction, but they aren&#8217;t there yet. Post-production on films and shows happens in LA.</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; just because somebody says you are.</strong></h3>
<p>Human beings are strange creatures. We love to kick our wounded. I don&#8217;t know what it is, but people will love you when it&#8217;s easy to and hate you when it&#8217;s easier. There is nothing that will take the wind out of your sails more than negative feedback from colleagues. Complete strangers? Whatevs. But colleagues&#8230; That&#8217;s a tough knife in the gut. And there are those out there who are self-loathing enough to let you have it. Believe me. As I&#8217;ve just finished a very personal project, the barbs from the people I figured would lob them last have found their mark. And for a while, I internalized every one, taking it apart and searching for where I&#8217;d gone wrong. But then I realized that those people are not my audience. Do you make music for other musicians? I sure don&#8217;t. So what was I worried about?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: The people who love what you do love it because it does something for them. It fills something in them. It cures what&#8217;s ailing, if only for five minutes. That is your <em>audience</em>. <em>The</em> <em>fans</em>. Not the freaks&#8230; <em>the fans</em>. The freaks are just freaking. They need something to freak about so that they don&#8217;t have to keep staring at their own work. There will be people who &#8220;get&#8221; what you do and there will be people who just don&#8217;t and never will. Just accept that those people aren&#8217;t the people you are doing this for and they likely never will be. Don&#8217;t read your comment feed. Never punch down. Even the biggest stars in entertainment get railed by the folks who are sitting at home doing nothing. If you happen to convert a non-believer through consistent output that ultimately changes their mind, awesome&#8230; You&#8217;re lucky. That doesn&#8217;t happen often. Take great care of them and don&#8217;t abuse their commitment to your art by following up with a piece of crap. But if you never do, remember who you are playing to: <em>Your fans</em>. The dedicated few. Your niche. Your tribe. Your supporters. The people who will join your mailing list, share your content in their social circles, attend your panel discussions, and email occasionally to tell you they &#8220;enjoyed this last one&#8221;. That is the person you are working for. That is where your mental bandwidth deserves allocation. Not thinking about how to <em>get new fans</em>&#8230;. but thinking about how to care for the ones who are here already. That&#8217;s an endgame that matters.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Composer Brian Ralston puts a different spin on how you sell yourself as a composer in today's over-saturated market.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was talking with a friend, who, on behalf of his brother, was asking for advice on getting into the industry.  Specifically, his brother is the musician in the family while my friend is a more traditional businessman who sells product. My pal asked me, &#8220;How do you determine what to charge? I know that in my industry I have to do an analysis of what a product costs me to produce and how much profit margin I need to make to survive. If a music mix takes a certain number of hours and you can determine its cost to show the client, why can you not get people to pay for that?&#8221; This inevitably led to the train of thought that <em>you charge what you are worth </em>— a topic we have discussed here at SCOREcast many times in the past. But upon further discussion, I determined that in advising his brother on how to charge for his work, there was a fundamental problem in their approach. They were focused on selling the wrong product.</p>
<p>What Are You Selling?</p>
<p>Answer this question for yourself. As a composer, what product are you selling? Think about it. Answer honestly in your head before you read on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&#8230;(Queue Merv Griffin&#8217;s &#8220;Jeopardy&#8221; theme)&#8230;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you answer &#8220;music?&#8221; Did you answer &#8220;a film score?&#8221; Did you answer &#8220;fully produced tracks?&#8221; &#8220;Original compositions?&#8221; Well&#8230; you are wrong on all accounts. What is the product you are selling? The product you are selling is YOU!</p>
<p>It is a fundamental shift in how you look at your business. It&#8217;s why some composers can charge seven figures and perhaps you can not — those composers are worth more. But if you are frustrated because you feel the fully produced tracks on your demo are just as polished and unique as those composer&#8217;s then you are taking your eye off the ball. It is NOT about your music. It is about <em>YOU</em>. <em>You</em> are the product. ALL of <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>Of course you produce music, but that is only part of it. You also make the director feel like his or her movie was the best thing made this year. You also solve problems with a positive and professional approach that makes people want to be around you for months at a time on a project. You also communicate well and deliver on time and on budget. There is so much more to it.</p>
<p>The challenge in setting a price for your music is really just determining what <em>YOU</em> are worth to the client, rather than what your <em>music</em> is worth. A Blu-Ray can be purchased at the nearest store for about $15-$20 USD. There is a value assessment to that product that the market has determined and can sustain. But with us, our value changes — sometimes overnight. If your movie hits #1 in the country, all of a sudden you&#8217;ll be worth more. It is not like your music is any different today than it was yesterday before your film hit number one at the box office, but the value of having you on a future project is now much more valuable to a producer or director. It has nothing to do with your music.</p>
<p>The honest truth: If you are having a hard time getting your fee up it is because the industry does not feel <em>YOU</em> are worth that. If they felt you were worth the money, they would find the money to cover your fee. It also plays into <a title="Deane Ogden: Founder of SCOREcast" href="http://www.deaneogden.com/" target="_blank">Deane Ogden</a>&#8216;s frequent posts about the <em><a title="DeaneOgden.com | The Culture of Free" href="http://www.deaneogden.com/2012/02/23/the-culture-of-free/" target="_blank">culture of free</a></em>. If we agree to free gigs, we are simply affirming to the industry that we are worth&#8230; nothing.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the next time you re-evaluate your business plan and try to determine what your fee is, remember what it is that you are actually trying to sell. Also remember that you are not a <em>composer looking for a job</em>, you are a <em>business looking for clients</em>. It is a subtle distinction but an important one. It shifts the dynamic of where you sit on the ladder with your clients.</p>
<p>The product is not your music — the product is <em>YOU!</em></p>
<p>[sncallout type=&#8221;announcement&#8221;]<em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Leave your thoughts on this below. I would love to hear your take on what makes YOU a valuable product to your clients.</span> — Brian</strong></em>[/sncallout]</p>

				<description><![CDATA[SoundCloud is a versatile platform for composers and sound content creators of all kinds. Oliver Sadie goes inside to bring you the low-down.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1354" title="SoundCloud_logo-800x500_orange" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/01/800x500_orange-640x400.png" alt="" width="640" height="400" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/01/800x500_orange-640x400.png 640w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/01/800x500_orange-389x243.png 389w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/01/800x500_orange.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><a href="http://soundcloud.com/" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a> is a versatile and effective platform for composers and sound content creators of all kinds, and is arguably the next big thing in online audio. Over the last year and a half I have invested hundreds of hours on SoundCloud and would like to spend a few minutes with you to share a few nuggets I&#8217;ve picked up along the way, that may help you as a composer, and that may shed some light on the community aspects of the service, as well.</p>
<h3>Ten Point Briefing</h3>
<ol>
<li>SoundCloud is an audio platform for sharing, promotion and collaboration, with its own social networking framework.</li>
<li>SoundCloud is accessed via desktop web browsers, embedded webpage widgets and smartphone apps.</li>
<li>SoundCloud began as a music file sharing service in Berlin in 2007, by Alexander Ljung and Eric Wahlforss, growing from 1 million members in May 2010 to 9 million members in December 2011.</li>
<li>Members can upload sound files in all common formats, with public or limited visibility, downloadability and all common licensing options, Buy links and a vanity URL, for example soundcloud.com/the-chemical-brothers.</li>
<li>Tracks can have players embedded on external websites with flexible appearance and browser compatibility options.</li>
<li>Members can follow other members, provide feedback via timed comments, mark tracks as favourites, keep abreast of other member activity on a dashboard, and create and join groups.</li>
<li>Detailed stats are available, showing who played your track, where, when, how often, and who downloaded or saved your track to their favourites list.</li>
<li>SoundCloud is well integrated with Twitter, Facebook and other online social networks. At the Facebook f8 conference in September 2011, Facebook announced a strategic technology partnership with SoundCloud, effectively providing SoundCloud embedded exposure to over 800 million Facebook users.</li>
<li>Membership is free but there are premium accounts ranging from €29 to €500 offering various levels of storage, stats, widgets, support and other options.</li>
<li>Finally, and crucially, SoundCloud is a community.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Who Uses SoundCloud?</h3>
<p>Essentially, sound content creators of all types, and listeners of all tastes. From dance music producers like Deadmau5, Skrillex and Swedish House Mafia to A-list pop stars like Lady Gaga, Radiohead and Bjork, from indie singer/songwriters to podcasters, comedians and even newspapers like The Economist, and of course composers.</p>
<p>I asked a handful of film and television composers to share their experiences of SoundCloud, starting with LA-based Kerry Muzzey, who enjoys the community-oriented learning and social aspects of SoundCloud:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I have fallen in love with SoundCloud. I&#8217;ve enjoyed it not only for the many musical discoveries I&#8217;ve made but also for the ability to interact with other composers. I love that so many have been willing to share their tech tips and secret recipes. Sure, it&#8217;s a really simple and slick demo-hosting site: but take some time to go a little deeper and you&#8217;ll be surprised at the community you&#8217;ll discover: these are people who are passionate about music and about the beauty of sound.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Sean Beeson from Ohio has over 400,000 track plays on SoundCloud and gains from the marketing aspects it offers:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I use SoundCloud to gauge the success of my online marketing campaigns. I can see what sites people are accessing my music from, where in the world they are listening from, and what music the are listening to. It helps me to cater my sets to what music is most listened to in the hopes that I can gain greater exposure for my work.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Geographically, members are spread across the world in roughly the following order: US, UK, Germany, rest of Europe, Canada, Russia, Australia, Japan, rest of world.</p>
<p>UK-based Marie-Anne Fischer, film and television composer and chapter director of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/composium/" target="_blank">SCOREcast: London</a>, has experience with a number of online music platforms including ReverbNation. Marie-Anne shared a little about using SoundCloud for professional showreel and private sharing purposes:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I discovered SoundCloud <em>about 10 months ago </em>when I started writing demos for Sonokinetic because they use SoundCloud to post their demos. I like the direct connection and simplicity. SoundCloud is becoming more interesting to me as I have found more film and media composers on SoundCloud than I had on ReverbNation. I like the group features on SoundCloud where there is no clutter. I tend to be using SoundCloud more recently to link prospective clients to my showreel and being able to share private tracks is a great feature.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Given the fact that there are over 9 million members, of course not all members are professionals in the line of work they present on SoundCloud and membership is arguably weighted towards amateur enthusiasts, but that does not detract from its usefulness in professional spheres.</p>
<h3>Can SoundCloud Help Your Career?</h3>
<p>SCOREcast: London&#8217;s own Dominik Johnson, world music production specialist:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>SoundCloud, for me, is one of the best community music tools online at the moment for the pro musician / composer / producer. I know the audio quality on my music (typically 48kHz/24bit) can be lost with some of the upload compression, but to me, that’s a price worth paying. A few months ago an independent film director from Berlin got in touch after hearing a few of my works on there, we got chatting on there, then we starting having Skype calls – and BOOM! I’ve been commissioned to write some tracks for his upcoming feature documentary – and yes, his production team does have a budget for the music.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Dominik touched on a point above with regards to upload/playback quality, which I&#8217;ll explore in the Technical section further below.</p>
<p>I know of one case where the SoundCloud user was not necessarily the <em>beneficiary</em> of a career opportunity. LA-based film composer, orchestrator and conductor Deon Vozov has this story:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>For me as a composer, no, there&#8217;s nothing that&#8217;s happened on SoundCloud without my initiation that&#8217;s led to a contract. However, because I also do some small music supervision work, I have FOUND tracks on SoundCloud and gotten them placed in projects. The first few were free, but there are starting to be licensing gigs that pay a little something, help build reels, and feel more dignified. And believe me, it is much more fun to approach people with money than with &#8220;it&#8217;ll be good for your reel&#8221; statements of questionable accuracy.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Deon continues with an interesting point about the depth of SoundCloud&#8217;s penetration into the upper echelons of film-making:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>My clients seem to fall into two categories: producers and directors who are very, or at least comfortably, familiar with SoundCloud but not very well-funded yet, and producers and directors who’ve never heard of SoundCloud but can cut those juicy checks we all love to then spend getting the job done.</em></p>
<p><em> In other words, my experience has been that it&#8217;s still not an industry standard in audio post production. By gently guiding clients towards it, however, I think it will become more so.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Offering more insights than I could ever have hoped for, Deon goes on to make a point about visual versus audio impact of a demo reel:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>That said, it&#8217;s not selfless support of SoundCloud that has led me to steer clients to the site. Rather, I like to link even initially skittish clients, and potential clients, to private sets here because <strong>it gets them focused on listening with their ears rather than their eyes </strong>[emphasis mine]. </em></p>
<p><em>Everyone wants video links, and they will tell you with a straight face that they&#8217;re really listening to the music, and they really do believe that they&#8217;re telling the truth when they say that. But the reality is that these are highly visual, highly visually sensitive, and highly visually creative people experiencing audio tracks by way of how they feel about picture. </em></p>
<p><em>It is possible to separate picture from music, of course, but difficult, and it will always imprint indelibly upon the track. That can work in one&#8217;s favor (an expensive car spot, for example) or against it (a feature that suffers a malaise of some kind or other). By sending clients to a simple, easy-to-navigate, custom-built set, they have an interactive experience and can jump around in the set to find what they want to discuss and, if they&#8217;re bold enough to create an account, they can even leave timed comments for us to discuss in relation to their project.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Many of the responses in this section came to me as a result of engaging with the community on SoundCloud directly by publishing a track inviting my followers to share their stories as timed comments. Here&#8217;s a handful of other stories, in brief:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Uploaded 1st track, surprised by response. Uploaded more. Got made Soundclouder of the Day and then featured on SoundCloud <a title="SoundCloud Tour Page" href="http://soundcloud.com/tour" target="_blank">tour page</a>. Label emailed me and now I have two releases out.<br />
— Russell Knight, London</em></p>
<p><em>A few months ago Norwegian Landscape photographer Ole Salomonsen approached me via SoundCloud, asking if he could use my track &#8216;Counting Stars&#8217; on his latest vid of the Northern Lights. My first piece of paid work.<br />
</em><em>— Mei-Ling Grey, London</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Amidst the success stories, two cautionary tales emerged:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I believe I did *not* get a gig because of the music in my SoundCloud profile. I was considered during the final round of applicants, and <em>when asked for a portfolio I </em>directed them to my SoundCloud profile. Something like two days later I found out they gave the job to someone else. </em><em>This has led me to reassess the quality of the work I upload to SoundCloud, even though it could be that the work I have on my SoundCloud is quite different from the piece I made for that job.<br />
</em><em>— Rodrigo Hernández, Mexico City</em></p>
<p><em>I signed a contract with a company called [redacted] who have a group here on SoundCloud about three months ago. I had to go to a notary and everything, alas I have not heard from them since and they don&#8217;t reply to my emails.</em><br />
<em>— Andy Carter, Cornwall, UK</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The insights I&#8217;ve gained from these last two are to keep one&#8217;s SoundCloud profile tidy and focused on the target market, and to know who you&#8217;re dealing with.</p>
<p>One reason I&#8217;m able to share this article with you today is that my own case is potentially one more success story to emerge from SoundCloud, but this is not about me so I&#8217;ll save that for the end.</p>
<h3>How SoundCloud Compares to Other Audio Platforms</h3>
<p>In the user content audio hosting space, SoundCloud competes with, among others, BandCamp, ReverbNation and Myspace.</p>
<p><strong>BandCamp</strong> is mainly focused on allowing independent artists to sell their work, and are funded in part on a commission basis. Users can customise the look and feel of their music pages and have their tracks downloadable in many formats. BandCamp has attracted some commercially established artists including Amanda Palmer to abandon their labels and self-promote (interestingly, Amanda Palmer also has a <a title="SoundCloud: Amanda Palmer" href="http://soundcloud.com/amandapalmer">SoundCloud account</a>).</p>
<p>Jeremiah Pena, SCOREcaster, says:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I like Bandcamp. I don&#8217;t get as many track plays as Soundcloud, but it&#8217;s my main method of selling music to the general public, which SoundCloud doesn&#8217;t seem to do very well. It&#8217;s also very useful for building email lists, since you can have people supply an email address for free downloads. And it&#8217;s free, with no major limits like the free version of SoundCloud. I&#8217;m able to put a lot more music than I could there.</em></p>
<p><em>I do find SoundCloud much better for getting feedback and it has very good community features (commenting, groups, etc.) that Bandcamp doesn&#8217;t have.</em></p>
<p><em>— Jeremiah Pena, Film Composer, Utah</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In terms of usefulness to composers, BandCamp may serve a function to sell original soundtracks if the production licensing terms permit, but since BandCamp does not offer embedded players, the composer would have to set up a specific BandCamp page outside their main website, which may not be a desirable solution for those who like a one-stop-shop approach to their web presence.</p>
<p><strong>ReverbNation </strong>aims to provide a collaboration and communication platform as well as music hosting for independent artists, and have an embeddable player.</p>
<p>SCOREcast&#8217;s Marie-Anne Fischer knows ReverbNation well, having ruled the London and UK Classical charts with a regular #1 spot. In her words:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I started using ReverbNation in 2009 because I was able to link my playlist to my Facebook profile as an app. I wasn&#8217;t particularly interested at the time in having a Facebook fan page, so this was a great alternative. Unfortunately Facebook subsequently took away the ReverbNation band playlist feature from personal Facebook pages. &#8216;My Band&#8217; feature could only feature in a fan or group page but I was still able to use the widgets and apps for posting new tracks.</em></p>
<p><em>ReverbNation has been great for meeting musicians and I have already collaborated with a couple of them. During 2009 and 2010 I made great use of my ReverbNation site, my website is linked to my profile which I pay for annually.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Marie-Anne also offers us a comparison with her SoundCloud experience:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You can personalise ReverbNation&#8217;s profile which you can&#8217;t on SoundCloud but that hasn&#8217;t stopped me from using SoundCloud.</em></p>
<p><em>I like the statistics SoundCloud collects and provides me and also their feature where people can favour a track and leave a comment.</em></p>
<p><em>The great big difference between SoundCloud and ReverbNation is that SoundCloud is purely functional and works well where as on ReverbNation you can add your personal touch to your profile, link music to multiple stores, integrate with other websites, create newsletters, blogs and apps are only but a few of their features.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Marie-Anne is right about SoundCloud being less customisable than ReverbNation, which takes a modular approach to the profile page with a lot of control over content and branding. On SoundCloud, personalisation can be applied to player widgets for website-matching style and colour scheme, for user dropbox page branding, for linking other profiles like Twitter, Facebook etc. and for essential items like profile image and an HTML-enabled description area.</p>
<p>In terms of how that translates into commercial opportunities, I would argue that for a composer it is the presentation of your professional website that is more important than the presentation of your profile on the audio hosting website, but that can be debated in the comments below.</p>
<p>One other factor to consider is the service value available to non-paying customers. Although ReverbNation&#8217;s free account allows more tracks to be hosted than SoundCloud&#8217;s free account, the size of each track is limited to 8MB which forces lossy upload format; the longer the track the lossier it has to be to fit into 8MB.</p>
<p><strong>Myspace</strong> does not make for great headlines these days, having been sold to News Corporation for $580 million in 2005 and then bought by Specific Media and Justin Timberlake in 2011 for $35 million. But as a music hosting social networking site with 33 million unique US visitors in August 2011, it cannot be ignored in this comparison.</p>
<p>Oxford-based soundtrack composer, electronica producer and SCOREcast reader &#8220;The Unfinished&#8221; (Matt Bowdler) shared his experience with me:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Myspace, I haven&#8217;t used for a long time. It may have improved, but I think it has been superceded by SoundCloud from a music hosting perspective and Facebook from a community perspective. The options were limited (I think ten tracks was the maximum) and it just got incredibly spammy. Endless messages from people who were plugging their latest track or gig that was almost always a genre that bore no relevenace to what you were doing. Quite a bit of spam from Myspace themselves as well. Put quite simply, there isn&#8217;t anything that Myspace does that isn&#8217;t done better elsewhere.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I think Matt&#8217;s view is shared by many in the music community including myself: That Myspace is not necessarily the most strategic technology partner for a professional composer. If you disagree, please share your experience in the comments below.</p>
<h3>Technical Considerations</h3>
<p>How do you get your SoundCloud tracks on your web page? SoundCloud makes it simple.</p>
<p>You can embed SoundCloud widgets in several sizes and styles, with both Flash and HTML5 options. HTML5 is more mobile browser-friendly, especially on iPhones and iPads which can&#8217;t play Flash, but some older browsers (e.g. IE6) can&#8217;t view HTML5.</p>
<p>To embed a track or set, use the Share menu item at top left of the track or set to access the widget options, customise to taste.</p>
<p>Here are some Flash and HTML5 examples of embedded track players.</p>

<h4>The main technical issues reported by professional SoundCloud users are well-known and steps have been taken to address them.</h4>
<p><em>1. SoundCloud playback is compressed at 128kbps, which many audiophiles can discern distinctly from studio-quality uncompressed recording.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In previous email exchanges, SoundCloud staff let me know that they&#8217;re always thinking of and considering ways to make the experience better for both creators and listeners. One way for creators to offer higher quality is to enable downloads for their sounds so listeners can access the file in its original quality. They&#8217;re regularly discussing this topic internally and are considering changes in the future.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In the meantime, SoundCloud seems to remain the platform of choice for many sound libraries&#8217; demo tracks, including Sonokinetic, 8dio and others, which is a good indicator that the quality, although not perfect, is widely acceptable for professional demo purposes.</p>
<p><em>2. Flash-based SoundCloud players are subject to the inherent stability and compatibility issues of Flash, particularly where smartphones often have trouble showing Flash controls.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">SoundCloud recently released HTML5 versions of their embeddable widgets, addressing both the stability problem and making it compatible with most smartphones and mobile devices including iPhones and iPads. The new HTML5 widgets have been well-received and many say better looking than their Flash predecessors.</p>
<p><em>3. Some users reported that the encoding produced glitchy playback, particularly in high frequency ranges and at high volume levels.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Up until recently, SoundCloud advised: &#8220;This rarely happens but if it does, we suggest uploading in 320kbps 44.1kHz with at least -3dB of headroom&#8221; but a recent discovery has revealed that this is no longer required.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FLAC is the recommended upload format for optimal playback quality, but this may not be ideal for download purposes and is probably best-suited for playback-only tracks (non-downloadable). For people who would prefer to have their files available for download, the higher the quality of the lossy file they upload, the higher quality the encoding will be.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The <a title="SoundCloud: Help" href="http://help.soundcloud.com/customer/portal/articles/94796" target="_blank">Help Page</a> on this topic offers this advice:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Sometimes our transcoding system can create audio artifacts, as we transcode all tracks to 128 kbps mp3 for streaming playback. Uploading a lossless or high-quality lossy file will usually reduce these to a minimum, but unfortunately there&#8217;s not much we can do for the handful of individual tracks that are still affected.</em></p>
<p><em>If you choose to make your track downloadable though, the version users can download will be an exact copy of the version you uploaded, without any transcoding.</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is an important point with regards to using SoundCloud for track sharing between yourself and the film production co, or for demo or collaborative purposes: <strong>The track you download is the exact track that was uploaded, regardless of the playback encoding</strong>. So you can happily share your 192kHz 32-bit float wav file if that tickles your fancy, in full trust that that is how it will be received. You can also do so in complete privacy without violating your NDA.</p>
<p><em>4. SoundCloud has experienced unscheduled downtime in the past.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For 24 hours in October 2011, SoundCloud fell victim to an aggressive DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack leading to slow response times and occasional periods of downtime.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">No data was lost in the attack and no user profile security was compromised, but better measures have since been put in place to defend against future attacks of that nature. Unfortunately, no website is untouchable from such an attack attempt.</p>
<h3>My SoundCloud Story</h3>
<p>I joined SoundCloud in August 2010 and from the start had a revelatory and inspirational experience, so much so that by New Year&#8217;s Day 2011 I resolved to turn my life-long passion and hobby into a career. This I knew would be a long path but one that would hopefully be rewarding at every step of the way, and as 2011 passed by, I reflected on those intentions in confidence that things were finally moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>My first steps on SoundCloud were like most others—a one-way path of uploading music and hoping it would be heard and liked by someone, somewhere, just as most creative artists hope for their own art to be observed and appreciated. It only really happened for me when I realised that it was more than a music hosting site but a community as well.</p>
<p>And so I started engaging in-depth with other people&#8217;s music—going through their entire track lists to understand their own creative processes and leaving comments and, drawing on my own experience, leaving constructive feedback along the way. This revealed the reciprocal nature of SoundCloud interaction when all of a sudden my own tracks started drawing a lot of attention.</p>
<h4>Community</h4>
<p>The third stage of my SoundCloud involvement began in June when I decided to try tapping into the collective creativity of the SoundCloud community.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first crowd-sourcing project was extremely simple: &#8220;I invite you to suggest a name for this track&#8221;. SoundCloud staff noticed this, thought it was a cool idea, and tweeted it to their then 80,000 followers. My track got absolutely bombed by name suggestions and the winning title and subtitle were really well-suited to the track (<a href="http://soundcloud.com/oliversadie/namethis">White Light Rendezvous: For Those Who Follow</a>). With around 200 followers at the time, I then gained another 200 or so on the back of that mini-project.</li>
<li>The second project was a little more ambitious. I played a 9 minute piano improvisation and called it &#8220;I invite you to suggest an orchestral composition with timed comments on this track.&#8221; This got a lot of attention too with comments like &#8220;a harp arpeggio phrase for next 8 bars&#8221; and after about 100 comments I spent a month composing those elements over the original piano improv. I called the resulting track <a href="http://soundcloud.com/oliversadie/scs">&#8220;SoundCloud Sinfonietta: You Composed This&#8221;</a> which quickly racked up over 5,000 plays and was a finalist in the <a href="http://www.g-technology.eu/competition/">G-Technology Europe Driven Creativity Awards</a>.</li>
<li>The third project is still on-going and is called <a href="http://soundcloud.com/oliversadie/your-tune">&#8220;Your Tune&#8221;</a> where I invited followers to share a 20-second solo melody and composed a full-length orchestral or band instrumental track using the submitted melody.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Career Break</h4>
<p>As well as the community projects I run on SoundCloud, I also produce a lot of original work and get involved in many collaborations. Through a friend on SoundCloud, one of my original tracks <a href="http://soundcloud.com/oliversadie/ochre-threads-piano">&#8220;Ochre Threads&#8221;</a> was heard by an independent filmmaker in LA, also on SoundCloud, who is working on his 3rd feature-length film and wanted to use the track for a particular scene.</p>
<p>The same filmmaker then spotted a track I released in December 2011—<a href="http://soundcloud.com/oliversadie/of-valour">&#8220;Of Valour&#8221;</a>—and on the strength of that alone gave me the opportunity to score the entire feature-length film, due for release in Summer 2012.</p>
<p>This is potentially the career break I&#8217;ve dreamed of for many years and could be my ticket to full-time paid filmscoring work in the future.</p>
<h3>SoundCloud Communities</h3>
<p>Apart from members who used underhanded spam-like tactics to drive playcount and visibility, the most active and successful accounts are those of people who take the time to listen and provide feedback to other SoundClouders. The communities thrive in the timed comments, the track favouritings, the collaborations and in groups, especially those which have forum-like chat areas. There are also regular live meetups across the world, like <a href="http://blog.soundcloud.com/2011/10/13/soundcloud-global-meetup-day-review/">this one</a> in October 2011, which Yoko Ono got involved in too.</p>
<p>Naturally I prefer an organically grown community to one built on spam and follow-backs, and contributed <a href="http://soundcloud.com/101/community-building">&#8220;How to Grow Your SoundCloud Community&#8221;</a> to SoundCloud HQ, which they keep on the front page of the user guide here: <a href="http://soundcloud.com/101">soundcloud.com/101</a></p>
<p>The SoundCloud community is well supported by dedicated community teams with staff in Berlin, London and San Francisco, headed by <a title="Europa Award Winners 2011" href="http://theeuropas.com/2011/11/peer-index-wins-the-grand-prix-as-the-europas-awards-drifts-eastwards/" target="_blank">Europa Award-Winner</a> <strong><a title="David Noël" href="http://david-noel.com/" target="_blank">David Noël</a></strong>. The team actively promotes community projects via their <a title="SoundCloud Blog" href="http://blog.soundcloud.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>, <a title="Facebook: SoundCloud" href="http://www.facebook.com/soundcloud" target="_blank">Facebook</a> page (500,000+ followers) and <a title="Twitter: SoundCloud" href="http://twitter.com/SoundCloud">Twitter</a> account (150,000+ followers), for example a global project collecting translations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in as many languages as possible.</p>
<p>One very charming aspect of the <strong><a title="SoundCloud: Community Team" href="http://soundcloud.com/community-team" target="_blank">SoundCloud Community Team</a></strong> is their daily SoundClouder Of The Day nomination, where a member is singled out for their community activity or other unique attribute that deserves recognition. SCOTD alumni are then often contacted for input on community questions and feedback, and are given a little boost in follower-ship by means of a shoutout on their social networks.</p>
<p>&#8220;This Week in SoundCloud&#8221; is another community project highlighting interesting discoveries across the &#8216;Cloud, in podcast format on a weekly basis (incidentally, the jingle for this podcast was written by me and 2 other SoundClouders).</p>
<p>There is a lot to the SoundCloud platform, it is not just an audio widget on your demo page. I&#8217;ll end where I began: SoundCloud is a versatile and effective platform for composers and sound content creators of all kinds. It is arguably the next big thing in online audio, and maybe most important&#8230; it <em>is</em> a community.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Attention spans are short and very demanding. If you want to make your art into a business, you have to brand yourself and then market your art. No getting away from it.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For some reason, we creative types seem to take an instant dislike to the notion of Branding and Marketing.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t be quantified or packaged. We&#8217;re artists, darling. Our art speaks for itself. All true&#8230; but all the art out there is vying equally for all of your potential clients&#8217; attentions. And those attention spans are short and very demanding. If you want to make your art into a business, i.e. make money at it, you&#8217;ve no choice &#8211; you have to brand yourself and then market your art. No getting away from it.</p>
<p>And as film composers and sound designers, we&#8217;re usually selling art that&#8217;s <em>yet to be created</em>. So what might be a more effective overall marketing strategy is to think of how we can sell ourselves, our persona, our fun-to-work-with-ness, our attitudes to career and life, how you and I collaborating together will without a doubt create something more awesome than we could possibly have done separately.</p>
<p>So marketing is very important to the film music composer or sound designer. But it need not be boring, time-consuming or expensive. Marketing for us film sound creators can be quick, easy, painless, fun, interesting, and very cheap if you take a little time to think creatively about it. Even if you&#8217;re totally anti-marketing/branding/selling your soul, you&#8217;re probably doing some of it already without even realising it (I&#8217;ve talked about some of this in <em><a href="../../../../2010/06/heather-fenoughty-personality-branding.html"><strong>Personality Branding</strong></a></em>).</p>
<p><strong>And</strong>&#8230; if it sells more of your work or your services, what you complainin&#8217; about? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Here are all of the ways I can think of (so far) that a film music composer may market themselves. I&#8217;ve separated them out into whether I&#8217;ve used them or not, and how useful they&#8217;ve been up &#8217;til now. Hopefully you can pick out a few to start forming an easy strategy for marketing your wares and yourself.</p>
<p>This turned into rather a long list so stick with it&#8230;</p>
<h1>Marketing Stuff that really works &#8211; directly led to sales:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Online portfolio website with music and contact details</li>
<li>DVD Showreel ready to go upon request</li>
<li>Tailored CD submissions</li>
<li>Music licensing on other site which led to commissions</li>
<li>Content marketing (fancy name for blog attached to website): writing blog posts about opinions and thoughts about my experiences. This is all about building a connection with audience, fleshing out a more thorough picture of yourself, what you&#8217;re like as a person to work with rather than just a faceless, personality-less, unknown quantity.</li>
<li>Networking in person and seeing it as an opportunity to make connections for people with other people.</li>
<li>Having an elevator pitch ready to go&#8230; then getting out of the way, asking questions, listening, really engaging in creating the potential for a new business relationship.</li>
<li>Twitter for both forging new relationships and developing ones already made through other methods.</li>
<li>Maintaining and keeping tabs on pre-made business relationships on Facebook.</li>
<li>Word of Mouth recommendations from people you&#8217;ve worked with before. Isn&#8217;t as tricky as you might first think &#8211; be easy to work with, go above and beyond, add value, and make the client feel special (&#8216;cos they are &#8211; they&#8217;re working with you aren&#8217;t they?).</li>
<li>Working in associated roles &#8211; this is really a form of networking. The word-of-mouth that you can gain about you being a really cool person and being great to work with works wonders when you hear about new projects coming up and you offer music composition/sound design!</li>
<li>Collaborating with other artists in relevant areas for free or as equally paid co-creators in order to raise both of our profiles.</li>
<li>Doing really awesome work with awesome people on awesome shows with high profile venues/channels with massive audiences is worth its weight in gold (though this probably counts a word of mouth too).</li>
<li>Giving away free CDs of pre-composed music to trusted filmmakers to license whenever they might like to in the future. Sometimes they&#8217;ll come back to you for a bespoke version or even a new commission.</li>
<li>Participating on relevant trade forums.</li>
<li>Sending showreel CDs out to local and national production companies. I actually did this without checking whether they wanted to hear it first, tut tut. Even though it worked for me, right at the start of my career when I was a little fraidy-cat when it came to cold calling, it was such a small response &#8211; 3 replies from 100+ CDs sent out &#8211; that really, I spent an awful lot of money that could have been saved just by making a few phone calls. Though you never know&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<h1>Marketing stuff that probably worked indirectly, though I don&#8217;t know for sure, or methods I&#8217;ve implemented so recently that&#8217;s it&#8217;s hard to say what effect it&#8217;s yet to have:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Website SEO (search engine optimisation)</li>
<li>Building a website with a CMS or &#8216;Content Management System&#8217; (e.g. wordpress, joomla) that&#8217;s very easily update-able with news, presents a more unified site where the blog isn&#8217;t just an add on, and where you don&#8217;t need to go into the code to make site-wide changes.</li>
<li>Asking for testimonials for your website &#8211; also reminds the client how great it was working with you. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>Following up with email note after networking meetings (&#8216;great to meet you&#8217; type stuff).</li>
<li>Business cards handed out at networking events and included in showreel mailouts.</li>
<li>Trade press and general newspaper interviews.</li>
<li>Relevant website interviews.</li>
<li>Writing articles for relevant websites (such as this one).</li>
<li>Email signature including links to my latest work on- or off-line.</li>
<li>Twitter-driven traffic to my website &#8211; these visitors tend to stay around on the website a little longer than the average.</li>
<li>Scheduling tweets for Twitter to maintain a more consistent, steady online presence and reach more followers in all the different timezones.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong><br />
</strong>Marketing stuff I&#8217;ve tried that hasn&#8217;t worked for me so far (but might for you&#8230; but it&#8217;s dubious, and if you don&#8217;t have time or money or energy, then maybe don&#8217;t bother):</h1>
<ul>
<li>Private online music store selling mp3s and music licenses for media attached to my website.</li>
<li>A website built on flash &#8211; very little search engine traffic at all as most of it can&#8217;t be indexed.</li>
<li>&#8220;Faking it &#8217;til you make it&#8221;/exaggerating your achievements/pretending to be something you&#8217;re not personality-wise &#8211; you get found out eventually! It&#8217;s so tiring to keep up the facade consistently.</li>
<li>Following general marketing gurus and social media &#8216;experts&#8217; on Twitter.</li>
<li>Following lots and lots of people on Twitter &#8211; signal to noise ratio gets less and less favourable, even though your follow stats are high. They aren&#8217;t really a targeted audience.</li>
<li>Premium, i.e. paid-for, online portfolio/cv sites &#8211; e.g. Productionbase</li>
<li>&#8220;Working the Room&#8221; at industry networking events &#8211; no real, viable relationships formed as a result of constantly looking for instant &#8216;usefulness&#8217; indicators in conversations, looking over shoulders at other people who might be more &#8216;useful.&#8221; This behavior doesn&#8217;t really give the best impression.</li>
<li>Music &#8220;giveaways.&#8221; I tried this once and it didn&#8217;t work&#8230; but it might next time.</li>
<li>Myspace page (although I didn&#8217;t put a lot of effort into it)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Stuff I haven&#8217;t tried yet so can&#8217;t say either way. But these tips might send your business into the stratosphere, so am not ruling them out yet:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Professional logo design.</li>
<li>Headshots/professional photography (technically I have but it was for a different business &#8211; a live string group &#8211; and wasn&#8217;t really the right style for what I wanted to promote for my freelance composition).</li>
<li>Professional web design.</li>
<li>Hired professional PR and marketing services.</li>
<li>Email list marketing (round-robins, news updates)</li>
<li>Using bookmarking sites and comments on other blogs to drive traffic to my site (not intentionally anyway)</li>
<li>Paid-for ghostwriters for blog content.</li>
<li>Paid advertisements &#8211; e.g. Telephone directories on and offline, in trade magazines, on relevant trade websites.</li>
<li>Real-world thank you notes (vs email, which I actually do quite a lot).</li>
<li>Professionally printed branded headed note paper, &#8216;with compliments&#8217; slips, holiday cards etc.</li>
<li>Pursuing the press e.g. having a press pack ready, calling the press with a pre-made story or angle.</li>
<li>Video interviews/vlog (e.g. on your blog).</li>
<li>Branded associated merchandise &#8211; hats, cups, tshirts, bags, stuffed animals&#8230;</li>
<li>Reverbnation page (technically I&#8217;ve got a page. but I&#8217;ve not put anything of interest on it. So can&#8217;t really claim to be an authority on this one)</li>
<li>Publicity &#8220;stunts.&#8221;</li>
<li>Cold-calling production companies. (I take the easy route and ask my working friends and colleagues who I&#8217;ve met through networking or working alongside in related media who work at those companies, what&#8217;s going on there. So, technically, it&#8217;s warm-calling).</li>
</ul>
<h1>Final word &#8211; and this is as technical as I&#8217;m going to get&#8230;</h1>
<p>As media composers and sound designers, we are B2B &#8211; business to business &#8211; rather than B2C &#8211; business to consumer. We sell our services or our previously composed music to producers of other media as raw material for them to sculpt into the product that will be sold to the consumer &#8211; the audience. So a lot of the advice for marketing for musicians you may find on the web or offline, unless specifically for media music composers and sound designers, isn&#8217;t actually that relevant.</p>
<p>Ultimately, rather than focussing on the product, we&#8217;re aiming to be service providers &#8211; you&#8217;re selling you: your working personality, your style of collaboration, your creativity-on-tap. You can&#8217;t really afford to just let the music &#8216;speak for itself&#8217;. That&#8217;s your past. What you&#8217;re selling is in your future. Who you are as an artist. Your creative soul.</p>
<p>If that doesn&#8217;t scare you then you&#8217;re probably in the right business. Go get &#8217;em, tiger.</p>
<p><strong>Which marketing strategies do you use? What&#8217;s worked and what hasn&#8217;t? What would you add to these lists, and what points here are you inspired to take away and implement immediately? Tell us in the comments below.</strong></p>

				<description><![CDATA[I often get asked for a checklist of things one can do to break in to the business. Here is my personal "top ten" of lessons learned.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I frequently get emails from burgeoning composers and new Los Angeles transplants either looking for a composer assistant position or just advice on breaking into the industry.  I often agree to meet them (usually over lunch) and invariably get asked if it&#8217;s beneficial to assist and/or ghostwrite for a bigger name composer.  The advice I give them is almost always the same.  It comes from my own years of experience working hard to establish myself in the composer world.  A feat that I feel is not only difficult, but one most all of us are ever in the constant pursuit of doing.</p>
<h4>10 Lessons on &#8220;Breaking In&#8221;</h4>
<p>I learn something new on every film and further hone my craft and skill with each project.  There are some truly fundamental things I have learned in the last few years.  Many years ago, fresh out of USC&#8217;s Scoring for Motion Pictures and Television Program, I was given one particular piece of advice, from a highly respected composer that influenced me greatly as I set out on my composing career.  I would like to share this advice as well as some of my own lessons with you.  Here is my &#8220;top ten&#8221; list of lessons learned while breaking into the industry as a composer.</p>
<h5><em>1) You have to break into the business of tomorrow, not the business of today.</em></h5>
<p>Basil Poledouris said that. Today&#8217;s working directors and producers already have established composer relationships they go back to over and over. You have to find the up and coming directors and producers of &#8220;tomorrow&#8221; and work with them now before they make it in Hollywood. When they eventually get their first studio gig, they will usually go back to the people they know and trust from when they were struggling themselves. Hopefully you will be one of those people on their team.</p>
<h5><em>2) Everyone&#8217;s path is different.</em></h5>
<p>So don&#8217;t think if you do what the guy next to you is doing, you will get the same result.  Some composers are at the right place (or on the right film) at the right time, and their preparation synergistically meets with their opportunity.  Some pound the grind stone for years and years before getting noticed.  Careers are like snowflakes.  No two career paths are alike.</p>
<h5><em>3) Set a precedent as Department Head.</em></h5>
<p>Music Composer (as on-screen credited on a film or show) is a &#8220;department head&#8221; job. The only way you will get bigger and better department head jobs (on multi-million dollar films) is to have a proven track record AS A DEPARTMENT HEAD on previous SUCCESSFUL films. Being the composer&#8217;s assistant, ghostwriter, orchestrator or musician on studio films do not count as a DEPARTMENT HEAD and will not help a studio see you as less of a risk in the composer job. I have learned this from 4 different studio level producers. This is all I have been hearing for the last 8-9 years.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, composer assistants, orchestrators, etc&#8230;are positions to be respected and it is valid work.  It just usually does not lead to a career as the lead composer.  And it certainly will not give you the freedom to develop your own &#8220;sound&#8221; which is also very important in building your brand as a composer.   Remember, your sound is what you will get hired for.</p>
<h5><em>4) Main title, on-screen credits matter most.</em></h5>
<p>If you are not the on-screen credited person, the credit really will not count to a producer hiring you to be their lead composer.  This is a subtle difference.  Again&#8230;working under the wing of another composer is valuable experience and work to be proud of, but you were not the lead composer in charge.  Your reputation was not the one on the line.  It is that on-screen, single, main title card credit of &#8220;music by&#8230;&#8221; that really matters most on your resumé.</p>
<h5><em>5) Recommendations are key.</em></h5>
<p>A word of mouth recommendation is a more powerful influence to getting a gig than anything else. If you get a strong recommendation from someone a director or producer respects, they will hire you nine times out of ten. One job truly leads to the next in this business.  And it is not just about getting &#8220;the gig&#8221; but also getting their next gig.  If the people you are working for hire you over and over again, you are probably doing something right.  If not, you may have to do some self evaluation.</p>
<h5><em>6) The entertainment industry is a business of relationships.</em></h5>
<p>Those relationships take years to establish. Trust takes a long time to build and a short time to fall.  You better be in this for the long haul.  Do not expect to arrive in town and think you are going to quickly find work.  It may take a good 5-7 years to start composing on films where people will start to notice you and another 5-7 to build off of that.  Ask yourself, are you in this for the long haul?</p>
<h5><em>7) Be a good listener. Be a good communicator.</em></h5>
<p>I could go on and on about this one in an article by itself. But to be successful in your job, you will have to be a master at both of these tasks.</p>
<h5><em>8) Be &#8220;production friendly.&#8221;</em></h5>
<p>Meaning&#8230; don&#8217;t be myopic to the music department issues only. Learn about every other step of the process in making a film. Heck&#8230;produce your own film sometime to learn about all the other issues one has to deal with in shooting and budgeting for a film. It will not only help you better communicate with a director as the composer, but it WILL make you a better composer in the long run. You will understand where everyone has just come from on a shoot and why things are the way they are in Post (which is usually the only thing composers care about).</p>
<h5><em>9) You must be well rounded in your skills.</em></h5>
<p>A successful composer in Hollywood is not just successful because they are good at composing music. Most all of them are great business people as well. They know how to market themselves. They know how to work a room at a meeting or at a social event. And, they know how to make a director feel like their film is the best film of the year. I know plenty of great composers.  The ones who do not make it usually fail due to issues completely unrelated to being a composer. The ones who have made it to various degrees (while competent in their craft) were not always the best composers&#8230;but were great at all of the other things. They were pleasant to be around and had a work ethic and professionalism that pushed them above the rest.  And thus&#8230;they kept getting hired.</p>
<h5><em>10) Refer back to #1.</em></h5>
<p>Holding true to these lessons over the last few years while working and following my own path has led me to conclude that doing my own music, developing my own sound, and networking to get my own composer gigs was the path for me. Maybe it isn&#8217;t for you. Perhaps you may want to experience the industry from the perspective of being someone&#8217;s assistant for a while; you can obtain real world experience and at least make a living while working in the field of music. Again for me, I would much rather spend all of my time on building my own credit list, reputation and skills as the lead composer.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/11/sig-ralston1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-956" title="sig-ralston" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/11/sig-ralston1.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>That is the question.</p>
<p>Lately, I have been talking to some industry friends of mine about their career philosophies and techniques for getting work. And while everyone has a different take on how they approach their careers, one fact to getting work seems to remain true among most all of them: Being busy seems to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>The individuals who go from one job to the next and have their year of work ahead planned out seem to further benefit from the very fact that they are busy. I was speaking with a good friend of mine who is a well respected Hollywood producer and he was discussing hiring crew for a film. The director of a film he is working on said he wanted to hire a specific production designer and that they had to make this person an offer early because they are busy. They wanted to &#8220;lock them in&#8221; early so they would not lose them to another project six months from now when they would actually need their services. In turn, my producer friend said he wanted to bring in and introduce a sound designer that the director had not worked with before and he was able to use the &#8220;busy&#8221; argument for her as well, even though she would not be needed until post-production even further down the line.</p>
<p>You see, this sound designer is busy. She seems to go from film to film. Some of her films you have never heard of. Some go to Sundance every year. Some of her work even stretches into the video game world. Regardless of the type of project, the very fact that she is always working puts her in a position to get an early offer for more work.</p>
<p>The executive producer said, &#8220;Well&#8230;she is always busy, so she must be good. Let&#8217;s get her.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have always felt that there is a fine line between being busy and building a credit list that is respectable and ever-increasing in size and scope. I have carefully chosen the projects I have worked on and have gone after specifically because I want each project to not only be one people respect, but to also be bigger in budget and scope than the last one. But there is a fine line: One can&#8217;t let the fear of remaining stagnant in their careers keep them from getting work, either. There has to be some middle ground.</p>
<p>I do not subscribe to the philosophy that you never turn down work. Sometimes the film or project may not be a good fit for you creatively and if your career is going to be hurt by your involvement, perhaps it is not a project worth taking on. Also, you may have certain financial obligations that prohibit you from taking some jobs that may—how should I say this?—<em>require</em> you to become an investor in the film. We have all been there.</p>
<p>Then again, if you are not busy and the phone isn&#8217;t ringing as much as you would like (especially in this economy), perhaps being busy, regardless of the type of project, would be a <em>good</em> thing. It creates momentum. Being busy creates demand for your work. As humans, we subconsciously see what everyone else is getting and we want that, too. Ultimately, you do want to create demand for yourself and your music, and perhaps the simple act of being a busy composer, regardless of what you are busy with&#8230; will do that for you.</p>

<p><strong>——————</strong></p>
<p>A pro is someone who gets paid for what they do, pure and simple.</p>
<p>Compare this with the opposite, the definition of an amateur, who does the same thing only for the love of it (i.e. for free).</p>
<p>As soon as you get paid, you can legitimately call yourself a professional. A &#8216;Pro&#8217;.</p>
<p>But, ultimately, only by <em>being professional</em> can you get to this point <em>and stay there</em>.</p>
<p>A roundup of the qualities of the Pro Film Music Composer (by no means exhaustive!) follows…</p>
<p><strong>1.  It&#8217;s business, not a hobby</strong><br />
If you&#8217;re in this business as a pro, then you&#8217;re a businessman/woman. That means working regularly, persistently on not only your music but <em>on</em> your business.</p>
<p>Get your affairs in order: tax, insurance, working environment, legal requirements. You&#8217;re in this game to sell your music, to get paid for composing.</p>
<p><strong>2.  Be an expert</strong><br />
Educate yourself in composition, musical styles, and methods of collaboration and delivery.</p>
<p>Keep your knowledge up-to-date with new technological innovations, musical trends, media language, etc. Have an <em>informed</em> opinion.</p>
<p>Note: this does not mean jumping on the bandwagon/keeping-up-with-the-Jones&#8217; by buying every new piece of technology that comes out. This does mean knowing what&#8217;s new, what it can do, and what it may or may not be able to do for you now and in the future.</p>
<p><strong>3.  Be objective</strong><br />
You&#8217;re creating raw materials for someone else to manipulate, not a completely finished, final product. Don&#8217;t get precious.</p>
<p>Accept criticism graciously.  It&#8217;s not personal; even when it seems like it is. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>4.  Pro-actively research and create opportunities</strong><br />
Use downtime between gigs to update your showreel, website and promotional materials — you never know when you&#8217;ll get asked for them.</p>
<p>Seek out new contacts and build relationships; plan ahead, refine your business systems, identify potential new opportunities in the making, and then <em>go after them</em>.</p>
<p><strong>5.  Invest in your business</strong><br />
Invest <em>time</em> in your education, your experience, and in building relationships with potential clients.</p>
<p>Invest <em>money</em> in equipment — the right tool for the right job — and, again, in your education, both in your skills and in running a business.</p>
<p>Invest <em>energy</em>: this isn&#8217;t a job you can just fall into. It takes focus, motivation, persistence and courage. Get on and do it already.</p>
<p>Invest in your <em>team</em> and build support networks for streams of advice and leads on sources of work, and identify potential assistants and colleagues that can bring complementary skills when you might need them. Build your team in advance to save essential writing time when that call finally does come through.</p>
<p><strong>6.  Take responsibility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be responsible for your business; you know you&#8217;ve no-one to hold accountable but yourself.</li>
<li>Act professionally: deliver on time; be courteous, civilised, and amiable to work with, yet focused; be prepared for any and all contingencies you reasonably can be; learn from past mistakes and plan for future successes.</li>
</ul>
<p>So whilst being paid for a gig defines you in the moment as a &#8216;Pro&#8217;, <em>being</em> a Pro will more importantly get you to that point and give you the best shot at <em>staying</em> Pro!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a whole category of cliché that seems, at first glance, to revel in shallowness. &#8220;Fake it till you make it,&#8221; &#8220;image is everything,&#8221; &#8220;style over substance&#8221; and a bunch of others, all trumpeting the virtue of <em>looking</em> the part… to the detriment, one supposes, of actually <em>being</em> the part.</p>
<p>Our career, though, hinges on perception. In fact, film music could be said to be <em>all about</em> manipulating the perception of an audience (through music). So maybe there&#8217;s an argument to be made that these clichés, empty and soulless as they may seem, actually have some value for us in our day-to-day professional lives. More on image, and why it is actually important, after the jump.</p>
<p>The next time you&#8217;re at a gathering of film music professionals, take a look around. Compare the throng before you to the <a href="http://www.euphonix.com/pro/news/img/client_music/euph_HZimmer_piano.jpg">glossy</a> <a href="http://www.tracksounds.com/specialfeatures/cue/2007/cue_awards_2007_outstanding_composer.htm">publicity</a> <a href="http://www.suite101.com/view_image.cfm/891214">photos</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/media/rm448960512/nm0853380">candid</a> <a href="http://www.bearmccreary.com/blog/?p=2167">event</a> <a href="http://www.michaelgiacchinomusic.com/biography.htm">shots</a> of A-list film music personalities you see on websites, in trade magazines and newspapers. Realize that the images that these famous composers are sending out into the world are usually painstakingly calibrated to coordinate with their image — generally hip, creative, elite and expensive. (For plenty of others I&#8217;ve seen at events lately… not so much.)</p>
<p>At a certain point some A-listers actually budget for professionals to come in (a publicist, typically, or maybe a graphic designer, or a website consultant… the list goes on) and make them appear even <em>more</em> professional. Professionalism professionals.</p>
<p>Pretty <em>meta</em>, right? Or pretty <em>metro</em>, if you prefer. Either way, these folks clearly believe it gets results.</p>
<p>You may not be exercising much discrimination when it comes to your image, but an image of sorts—the <em>default</em> one, which for most of us falls under the heading of &#8220;…needs work&#8221; — is presenting itself nonetheless. It always does. And people come to associate the look with the profession.</p>
<p>Think about that the next time you see some bleary-eyed, socks-and-sandals composer crawling out from under their studio rock to bask briefly in the sun outside Starbucks.</p>
<p>Perception is reality… another cliché, sure, but when we&#8217;re interacting with individuals who have the power to make or break your career based on their hunches, or their intuition, or simply their <em>mood</em>, I think attention to professional presentation is worth a little head space. Too much is at stake to do otherwise.</p>
<p>These days it&#8217;s a hot topic of conversation to hold forth on those few of us who can command more than a pittance to do this job. I think one way the &#8220;million-dollar score&#8221; clique got there was to <em>look</em> like a million dollars.</p>
<p>It goes beyond the person, of course, to the entire setting: like so much of Hollywood, there&#8217;s a danger of obsessing over the right way to stock the koi pond, or whether it&#8217;s better to roll up to your director lunch in a Mercedes or a Maserati… but this whole thing doesn&#8217;t really have to be incredibly spendy or self-aggrandizing. <em>Really</em>, it doesn&#8217;t. And you don&#8217;t have to have the world&#8217;s greatest design sense to create a space and a &#8220;look&#8221; that communicates your own identity to your collaborators.</p>
<p>It just takes a little effort, and a little thought, and a little creativity. All stuff we&#8217;re good at. Be the kind of professional you&#8217;d like to be seen hanging out with. The kind you&#8217;d pay good money to work with. It&#8217;s a respect thing, that&#8217;s all. And respect is never a cliché.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My goal in starting this website and podcast has always been to make our professional film music community “smaller” as we naturally grow “larger”. Over the past year, our website has undergone many alterations and we&#8217;ve experimented with various ways to communicate and interact as a community. Some of these methods have worked and some of them have needed further tweaking, but we&#8217;ve always strived to make SCO the very best experience it can be. To commemorate our anniversary, we will be launching even more new features at SCOREcastOnline.com in the coming weeks that will make the site even more robust as we seek to better serve this community.</p>
<p>One of the things that I believe differentiates SCO from the rest of the pack is that we are all <em>working professionals</em>—none of us are offerring knowledge or putting something out there for public consumption that isn&#8217;t a tried and true method, technique, philosophy, or question in our own daily working film music routine. It annoys me to no end to encounter people who really have no idea what it is like being a working professional in this business, yet they either want to tell you all about how to do it or they have an opinion that they feel is relevant— never mind the fact that they haven&#8217;t written a note or edited or mixed music for the last fifteen years. How can this person *truly* know what it is like NOW in the film music business, other than to simply speculate on something they know very little about? (And for the record, I&#8217;m NOT talking to those of you who are just coming up in the biz—&#8221;Looking for&#8221; work and &#8220;talking about&#8221; work are two different things. To me, one is of merit. The other? Not so much.)</p>
<p>Which leads me to a potential discussion with you: <strong><em>GOING PRO</em></strong>. What does that mean? What is the difference between being a <em>professional</em> film composer, music editor, orchestrator—what have you—and being an <em>amateur</em> hobbyist?</p>
<p>Understand this difference: I&#8217;m NOT asking, &#8220;How does a person <em>make the leap</em> from being an amateur to being a professional?&#8221; Or even, &#8220;How do you <em>break into</em> the working community?&#8221; Instead, I&#8217;m seeking to illustrate and highlight the <em>differences</em> in the two species—because a working film composer and a film composer who isn&#8217;t working are two VERY different animals… and the reasons why, at least to me, are extremely telling and very educational for all of us at every stage of the career.</p>
<p>Like many of my working colleagues who&#8217;ve had any amount of success at this gig, I&#8217;ve lectured in plenty of film music classes at the university level. After years and years of doing so and talking with hundreds—if not thousands—of students, my spirit of discernment operates at a fairly high level: I&#8217;m able to tell which students have the chutzpah and internal drive to eventually find their way into the professional ranks and which ones do not.</p>
<p>I have a lot to say on this topic, and I&#8217;ll spread it out over the rest of May in various articles I&#8217;ll write, but in the meantime, and to get the party started, here are two immediate thoughts that come to mind that I feel are relevant to all of us:</p>
<p><strong>Personal Responsibility</strong><br />
Everyone screws up. On almost every project I&#8217;ve ever worked on, somebody somewhere has messed something up. Sometimes the mistake is small and it goes unnoticed and gets swept under the rug, and sometimes it&#8217;s a Category 5 disaster that cannot be ignored and the entire scoring team, from the studio executives on down, hears about the blunder. Usually, with some quick thinking and a little magic dust, it is fixable. Sometimes it costs the person their job.</p>
<p>No matter what, and in every case, a <em>professional</em> takes the responsibility for everything they do, good or bad, pretty or ugly. There is no pointing fingers, no whining about how someone else is to blame. If you did it, you own it.</p>
<p>As a film music pro, there is no surer way to kill your career than passing the responsibility buck. I used to compose music for NBC&#8217;s &#8220;The Apprentice&#8221;, and &#8220;The Celebrity Apprentice&#8221; is still a huge guilty pleasure in my home for both me and my family (I finally got them hooked!). One thing that has always fascinated me about that show is how well the teams work together and have each other&#8217;s backs. That is… UNTIL they get to the Boardroom, where they, without fail, start throwing each other under the bus in an effort to stay on one more week. While I understand that this is part of the dynamic that makes a show like this work, it still blows my mind how far people are willing to go to cast blame on others for what are so obviously their own poor decisions. Many times, Trump sees right through this kind of crap and yells, &#8220;You&#8217;re Fired!&#8221;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s worse? These are all people who are <em>working professionals</em>! Truthfully, I&#8217;ve lost much respect for many &#8220;celebrities&#8221; that I once held in high regard by watching them sell their teammates out to stay alive one more week. This isn&#8217;t an indictment on Reality TV. It is an indictment on not taking Personal Responsibility For Your Own Actions. You have to own your own shit. If you did it, face it and be a professional about it. Own up to it, fix it quick, and move on with getting your job done.</p>
<p>Everybody makes mistakes, but one of the things that differentiates a <em>professional</em> from an <em>amateur</em> is the ability to own up, apologize appropriately, and make things right.</p>
<p><strong>Acting vs. Reacting</strong><br />
This is another personal core value of mine, and it&#8217;s a doozy.</p>
<p>Are you the kind of person who <em>waits</em>? <em>Waits</em> for someone to call, <em>waits</em> until April 15th to file taxes, <em>waits</em> to have the tough conversation, <em>waits</em> to deal with broken gear, <em>waits</em> to put processes and people in place until &#8220;I absolutely need to&#8221;, <em>waits</em> to demo for a project until it shows up on IMDb, <em>waits</em>, <em>waits</em>, <em>waits</em>, <em>waits</em>, <em>waits</em>?????</p>
<p>If yes, then you&#8217;ve got a problem. Mark my words: You are going to have a hard time in the film music business.</p>
<p>Again, a delineation: I&#8217;m not talking about &#8220;timing&#8221;. <em>Appropriate Timing </em>is an art unto itself that I will discuss later this month as we dive deeper into Professionalism. No, I&#8217;m referring to &#8220;putting things off&#8221;. <em>Procrastinating</em>.</p>
<p>I like to do the opposite. I act NOW. If I hear about a project in it&#8217;s early stages of pre-production and I want it—I jump on it TODAY. Not tomorrow, not Friday… TODAY. If I learn of a potential scheduling conflict that is headed my way, I handle it this very second. I do not&#8230; <em>wait</em>.</p>
<p>I pay estimated quarterly taxes. I don&#8217;t wait for April 15th to do all of that work. I pay business expenses at the beginning of the month instead of at the end. I deal with staffing issues when they happen, not after they unfold. I take my team out for regular <em>play dates </em>instead of waiting until they are dragging ass and need a jolt of emergency R&amp;R.</p>
<p>I diagnose computers or take them to the &#8220;doctor&#8221; at the first sign of trouble rather than waiting for them to go belly-up two days before a deadline.</p>
<p>I initiate conversations with producers and directors and I do not wait for them to seek me out by word of mouth. I make it a point to network, socialize, and mingle. I work to meet and befriend at least one new person in my life every single day.</p>
<p>I return all of my calls and emails once in the morning and once before I go home for the day. I follow up with all of my team members on each project by sending something nice (when appropriate) or telling them in person how much I appreciate them.</p>
<p>All of these things are in an effort to <em>work ahead of schedule</em>. Ultimately, it all becomes important on the day that a big project hits my studio, along with the realization that if these things aren&#8217;t already done, they won&#8217;t get done for the next 4-6 weeks. At that point, it&#8217;s too late—I&#8217;m committed. The work now dictates how I can spend my time, and no matter what, I have to maintain focus to meet my project&#8217;s deadline. This means that many of these aforementioned tasks must fall by the wayside in order to meet that commitment, and so I must operated in my &#8220;downtime&#8221; with a bias toward working ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>Most people I have encountered that are only sort of poking around with the idea of making a career out of composing act exactly counter to the way I just described. They toy around with these things. But <em>professionals</em> don&#8217;t. And if you want to ascend to the next terrace in your career, you can&#8217;t either.</p>
<p>I had an instructor once who used to tell us that the best way to get to the next level in anything in life—sports, music, business, relationships, fitness… whatever—is to &#8220;start living and acting on that level&#8221;. How true this is.</p>
<p>Where are you headed and what do you need to change in order to get there?</p>
<p>I await your comments below.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-356" href="../../../../2010/04/heather-fenoughty-acknowledge-your.html/sig-fenoughty"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-356" title="sig-fenoughty" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sig-fenoughty.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>I cannot emphasize enough how incredibly important it is to acknowledge your success in creating, to completion and delivery, a musical score. </span>This music that you have produced is an integral part of the film, show, game or whatever project it is. It could not exist in its current form without your efforts.</p>
<div>For the sake of your growth as a composer, sound designer, or other post-production professionals, you must underline the importance to your own psyche that this is a moment to be emphasized and cherished, that it is something desirable &#8211; and so to be repeated.</div>
<div>How often have you actually gotten to the stage of delivery in all of your projects? As Lee said in <a href="../../../../2010/04/delivery-finaling-and-changing-world.html">this post</a>, it&#8217;s never a done deal that the project will complete and you&#8217;ll be able to get to that all-important stage of delivering your musical opus. So when you do get there… celebrate!</div>
<p><span id="more-297"></span></p>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"> </span><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="font-family: inherit;">Reap the Rewards</span></strong> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Reward yourself &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t have to be expensive, it doesn&#8217;t have to mean going on vacation for 3 months, but it must be significant. </span></span></div>
<div>You want to spend a day reading that book you never have time to get around to? Do it, and enjoy it, and banish any feelings of guilt that you should instead be working on something else!</div>
<div>Go out for a meal, go sit in the park, by the beach, catch up with friends over a coffee. For a certain length of time, be it a week, a day, or even just a few hours, get a change of scenery or schedule and just have fun.</div>
<div>Reward your family and friends, the ones that stuck by you when you were working long hours, the ones that made sure you ate properly and kept the roof over your head whilst you were waiting for the installments to come through, those who had their ears bent whilst you whined about how the project may not have been going to plan or you were having a tough time with a colleague.</div>
<div>You know who they are. Let them know that they&#8217;re appreciated and that they had a significant hand in you achieving this success &#8211; and that they get rewarded too!</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Space and Time</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The importance of stepping back and allowing a little space and time to reflect on the processes and experiences you&#8217;ve gone through to reach the success of delivering cannot be overstated.</span></span></div>
<div><a href="../../../../2010/04/weekend-provocation-post-mortem-edition.html">Lee&#8217;s post on the &#8216;Post-Mortem&#8217; process</a> illustrates this very effectively: check what went wrong, system-wise and operationally, select material for demo versions and samples, paperwork and admin updates, thanking people who helped get the project to this stage.</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gratitude</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">I think the point Lee mentions at the end is possibly the most significant in the long run: Gratitude. Being thankful to yourself that you worked hard to get to this point in the project &#8211; that delivering a finished, finalized score is no mean feat &#8211; is essential. </span></span></div>
<div>You have the skills and the talent to achieve something great, possibly life-changing but at least enjoyable for those that hear and experience the project, whatever form it takes. Acknowledge this.</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recharge Your Creative Batteries</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Going from one project to the next without a period of time to recharge can be dangerous. Creative burnout is a serious issue for those of us working in the creative industries, not least because the creative value we produce is our source of money! </span></span></div>
<div>Having a temporal buffer between projects is essential not only for the reward and analysis procedures already mentioned, but for recharging your creative batteries. Get some distance from the music and sound themes of the project just delivered, or risk inadvertently re-hashing those themes and ideas for the next gig.</div>
<div>You need time to let those ideas go and to get prepared for the excitement of new themes, textures and colors that will come to you, given that chance.</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Accept Compliments Gracefully</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Finally, in acknowledging your own achievement in delivering an awesome score on schedule in an organized and professional manner… you must also learn to notice and accept the compliments and acknowledgments of others! If someone praises your work, say thank you! Do not put down the achievement with, &#8216;it was nothing,&#8217; or other such self-effacing statements. </span></span></div>
<div>You know as well as I do: it certainly was not nothing.</div>
<div><span style="font-family: inherit;">By acknowledging success and accepting compliments graciously, you will build confidence in your abilities and improve your self-esteem, which will ultimately mean the improvement of you as a composer.</span> <span style="font-family: inherit;">You&#8217;ll be more assured of your skills and potential, will have more faith in your own ideas and opinions about the use of music and sound in film.</span></div>
<div>Rather than staying within the safety and security of &#8216;what works&#8217;, you&#8217;ll be more willing to take the risks required to create something genuinely brilliant and different next time.</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">In conclusion&#8230;</span></div>
<div>Having the time and space to reflect is no luxury. It is an essential part of the process, a tool not only to analyze and correct any problems, but to gratefully accept the success that you&#8217;ve achieved in delivering this score.</div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Ultimately, it will only make you a stronger and better prepared for the next gig!</span></span></div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/02/sig-fenoughty1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-719" title="sig-fenoughty" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/02/sig-fenoughty1.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>Pitching for composing jobs is a necessary part of the business. By finding a niche and hanging out your wares, you&#8217;ll effectively reduce your competition from other composers, and by being an excellent chap to work with you&#8217;ll be inundated (!) with repeat business.</p>
<div><em>But there will be times when you just gotta knuckle down and compete to get the gig.</em></p>
<div>I, as a person, am not particularly competitive. Inherently, I&#8217;m more interested in the collaboration side of this job &#8211; I think that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re all at this crazy game, no?</div>
<div>I&#8217;ve somehow managed to get away with competing no more than 4 times for a gig (that I can remember… maybe I blanked the rest of the times out…). Read on to find out how they turned out (save for the most recent &#8211; I&#8217;ll let you know when they get back to me) and what lessons there&#8217;s to be learned.</div>
<div><a name="more"></a></div>
<div>I&#8217;m seriously grateful that in most of my work I&#8217;ve been kept busy with commissions from repeat business and word-of-mouth recommendations. I put this down to <em>finding my niche</em>.</div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><span class="hw" style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">niche</span> <object style="margin: 1px;" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="13" height="21" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><embed style="margin: 1px;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="13" height="21"></embed></object> <span class="pron" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #809e83; cursor: pointer;" onclick="pron_key()" onmouseover="return m_over('Click for pronunciation key')" onmouseout="m_out()">(n<img src="http://img.tfd.com/hm/GIF/ibreve.gif" alt="" align="absbottom" />ch, n<img src="http://img.tfd.com/hm/GIF/emacr.gif" alt="" align="absbottom" />sh)</span></span></p>
<div class="pseg"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><em>n.</em></span></p>
<div class="ds-list" style="margin-left: 1cm;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><strong>1. </strong>A recess in a wall, as for holding a statue or urn.</span></div>
<div class="ds-list" style="margin-left: 1cm;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><strong>2. </strong>A cranny, hollow, or crevice, as in rock.</span></div>
<div class="ds-list" style="margin-left: 1cm;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><strong>3. a. A situation or activity specially suited to a person&#8217;s interests, abilities, or nature: </strong><span class="illustration" style="color: #226699; font-style: italic;"><strong>found her niche in life.</strong></span><strong> </strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><strong>b. A special area of demand for a product or service</strong></span></p>
<div class="sds-list" style="margin-left: 1cm;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><span style="color: #226699;"><em><br />
</em></span></span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"> </span></p>
</div>
<div>Looking back, it wasn&#8217;t a conscious decision, I don&#8217;t think. It just kind of happened while I was focussing on getting any and all composing and sound design work I could possibly find.</div>
<div>I have a composing niche. It&#8217;s orchestral, created with samples and often has a contemporary vibe, somehow. There&#8217;s usually a quirky or dark flavour to it.</div>
<div>Though to be fair, I don&#8217;t think I can call this a niche. It&#8217;s more like 50-90% of the film composers&#8217; style out there&#8230; so that can&#8217;t be it what&#8217;s making me more attractive to clients.</div>
<div>I also have a geographical niche. Even though it&#8217;s the fourth largest city in England, few people have heard of Sheffield, my base in the UK. There&#8217;s a grassroots film and a reasonably successful television industry in the region… but there are so few composers here, I really have cleaned up.</div>
<div>I suppose I might consider that I have a personality niche. I&#8217;m uber-reliable, never miss a deadline (to date!), unusually objective towards my creations&#8230; sometimes it&#8217;s a rare quality in this line of work.</div>
<div>I do rather wonder if being a female composer has helped rather than hindered my career &#8211; maybe there&#8217;s an element of novelty value there?</div>
<div>So, back to pitching. The first time I pitched for a gig, it was an unpaid feature. I was fresh out of postgrad college and needed to get a credit and some showreel fodder urgently. I beat 40 other composers, wuh yeah! … but I think I had an unfair advantage at that level, and it was pretty much a done deal that I&#8217;d win. It was unpaid, and a student film too. I figured after the fact that not many composers with my experience, training and skill would probably go for a gig like that.</div>
<div>Moral of the tale &#8211; shoot low.</div>
<div>My god, that&#8217;s awful advice, that can&#8217;t be right.</div>
<div>Perhaps rather it should be… be better than the competition! But what does &#8216;better&#8217; mean. Let us know your thoughts in the Comments below.</div>
<div>The second time I pitched, I didn&#8217;t get the gig. There were two other composers in the running, and the best man won, to be fair. The pitch was very specific and precise, and I twisted it a little to suit my style, skills and gear. I had a few redrafts too after feedback, which meant I got closer to the desired product, a luxury not usually afforded to pitching composers. I think I was treated better since I&#8217;d worked with the director before and he was in my corner!</div>
<div>When I heard the music on the show though, I realised why I didn&#8217;t get the gig. They wanted Tibetan vocals and ethnic instruments with a very, intimate, human edge, and I&#8217;d given them music better suited to epic panoramas on a nature show. Oops.</div>
<div>At the time, I was pretty gutted &#8211; I&#8217;d assumed that since they&#8217;d come to me first and that the director wanted to work with me again that it was a done deal.</div>
<div>Trust me, it&#8217;s <em>never</em> a done deal &#8217;til the fat lady sings.</div>
<div>Morals of the tale:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>If the client has been very specific, really do follow that brief, to the letter. If they&#8217;ve come to you with the offer to pitch, they obviously know your stuff already. No need to do more of the same. Be as accurate as you can.</li>
<li>Never assume you&#8217;ve got the gig simply because you have an awesome working relationship with the director/producer/editor/music supervisor. He&#8217;s not the only one who has the final say…</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t take it personally. Rejection is par for the course in this line of work. It&#8217;s not personal, it&#8217;s not that you&#8217;re a bad person, it&#8217;s (hopefully) not that your music is dire. It just wasn&#8217;t right, and someone else got closer to that bullseye. Find out what the finished music was like, learn what it was that they meant by their brief, get over it and move on to the next job. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>The third time I pitched, I have to be honest… my heart wasn&#8217;t really in it. It was not a passion project, but rather a friend&#8217;s film, co-produced with a big-name channel, destined for broadcast &#8211; and so had the promise of back-end royalties. My heart became less in it when I got 3 very different briefs over the course of 6 weeks with various revisions going back and forth. By the end, I was still putting in the effort, but the love for the work had gone. Ugh.</div>
<div>Can you guess whether I got the gig? You&#8217;d be right I suspect &#8211; no, I did not win this particular commission.</div>
<div>Did I mind? Surprisingly (or not), no, partly because by this point I had developed that elephant-thick skin that is so important when dealing with criticism and/or rejection. But partly I was also a little relieved. The brief was really tricky to pin down and changed with every new conversation I had… and I took that as a sign of things to come. Also the tracks I wrote were awesome and I&#8217;m now selling them as library tracks. Win-win. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></div>
<div>Moral of the tale:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>When pitching, if the brief is hazy, ill-defined or keeps changing, you better develop some awesome mind-reading skills. Otherwise you have to rely on the gamble of guessing and hoping. This isn&#8217;t to say that you should avoid these gigs if they&#8217;re the only ones available to you at the time. You may get lucky. Just don&#8217;t get too attached to the outcome.</li>
<li>If a brief keeps changing as you pitch, it doesn&#8217;t bode well for the rest of the gig even if you do somehow win the commission.</li>
<li>If it&#8217;s not a passion project, or even a subject matter that interests you vaguely, the other benefits better be good. &#8216;Cos if they&#8217;re not… why are you pitching for it in the first place? There has to be some inspiration for those lines and dots, you know.</li>
<li>The music you wrote should be pretty awesome if you put your all into it. It still belongs to you. Why not flog it through a music library, or offer it to your local filmmaking buddies for non-exclusive licensing, if it&#8217;s appropriate for that sort of project. Sell it on iTunes. Don&#8217;t let it just sit there, put it to work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, as I write this I&#8217;m pitching again. I actually just finished uploading the tracks to the ftp!</p>
</div>
<div>Yikes.</div>
<div>This time the brief is pretty, well, brief. And not really a brief, more a transcription/reduction of an email conversation between the production company and the funding clients, where they decide that they&#8217;d like to compare different styles for the work rather than being very specific. It&#8217;s really very open-ended. But there are some &#8216;style&#8217; tracks that the clients appear to like and also a sample of the video to work to, which gives an idea of where they&#8217;re headed. And the genre of the project is sooooo in an area that I really want to get into, so the love is there.</div>
<div>So this one is a little bit of an experiment. I&#8217;m sticking to the &#8216;vibe&#8217; of the style tracks, but they&#8217;re definitely in my &#8216;niche&#8217; writing style too. I&#8217;m providing lots of variety within those styles, some very contemporary, some more orchestral and cinematic and also there&#8217;ll be tracks that blend the two styles.</div>
<div>If I get the gig, I want to be writing music that I want to write, that I love to write, that will make me jump out of bed in the morning in the knowledge that I&#8217;m scoring a series I&#8217;m excited about.</div>
<div>If I&#8217;m not the right gal for the gig with these tracks, I won&#8217;t be gutted that I didn&#8217;t get the job. I&#8217;ll be happy that I didn&#8217;t get contracted into writing for a project that wasn&#8217;t my cup of tea.</div>
<div>But I really do hope that I am the right gal for the job. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></div>
