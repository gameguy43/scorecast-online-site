					<description><![CDATA[Hi Jorge,
nice to see you here and thank you!

You should have an &quot;open&quot; button at the top of the sequencer view. Click the Sequencer button left of the Basic view button and then you should see it.

The factory sequences are loaded automatically when you open any of the matrixes, just activate the cells (double-click) and use the keyswitches to switch between sequences.

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks! I&#039;m glad you like the article. VI Pro at first really has a steep learning curve, but this is mainly because it just works completely different from any other sampler. Once you&#039;ve got your brain wrapped around it, its a joy to use!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Tobias,Â 
Excellent! This article brings new light to me.Â 

I&#039;m still puzzled, on how to import sequences inside the new sequencer (the folder&#039;s empty).
Paul from VSL said, Â I have to save a couple to be able to load them... (I know that) :)
I would like to access the sequences that come with the new factory presets... (Yes, I&#039;ve load them too).

Thanks for these marvelous reference pages!
