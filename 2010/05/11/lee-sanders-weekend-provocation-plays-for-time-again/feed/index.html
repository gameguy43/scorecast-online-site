		<description>Yup—I tend to allow a little extra time when I arrive for flights, so the airport lounge makes a terrific place to grab a coffee and a snack… kick back… recharge the computer… line out the work I&#039;m going to do on the plane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#039;m curious if other readers think of days when they&#039;re flying strictly as &quot;travel days,&quot; or if they try to compartmentalize it so that they&#039;re scheduling in other things on that day as well. Especially now that it&#039;s become a bit tougher to negotiate the airports.</description>

<p>I&#39;m curious if other readers think of days when they&#39;re flying strictly as &#8220;travel days,&#8221; or if they try to compartmentalize it so that they&#39;re scheduling in other things on that day as well. Especially now that it&#39;s become a bit tougher to negotiate the airports.</p>

		<description>I like that travel time!  I get things done that I wouldn&#039;t allow time for in my studio/office/home.  Blog posts are the usual beneficiary of travel time!</description>
