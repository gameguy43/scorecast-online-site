		<description><![CDATA[In the second part of SC's Template series, learn about the technology and methods involved in building an orchestral template.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to SCOREcast’s Orchestral Template series! This time, we will delve a bit into the technical background of creating a template. There are some ways in which a template can be set up, each of them more suited to a particular workflow and situation. But don’t worry &#8211; it won’t get too technical <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>In a nutshell, there are two general ways of hosting a template:</p>
<p>1) Inside the sequencer</p>
<p>2) Outside the sequencer (go figure!)</p>
<p>Hosting your template inside your sequencer mainly has the advantage of being easy to set up by not requiring any additional software or even hardware. Such a template works much the same way as a regular project you are working on. You load the sequencer file and are good to go. The settings of the template (the instruments loaded into it as well as for example CC values) are unique to this project and are automatically present when opening the file. Sounds good, doesn’t it? It _is_ good, but there’s more!</p>
<p>Here is where a template outside of your sequencer comes into play. Having your sequencer just play host to all those tracks, but not actually process the instruments has a number of key advantages:</p>
<p>&#8211; The sequencer just stores MIDI data and possibly audio data (if you use recordings/loops…). This keeps it mean and lean and usually results in a much snappier user experience.</p>
<p>&#8211; If multiple projects use the same (or more or less the same) set of samples, you can use the same template. This means that when switching between projects, the samples can stay loaded and you only need to load the (small) project file into the sequencer.</p>
<p>&#8211; If you are using a 64bit host, hosting plugins externally allows you (depending on the method used) to use 32bit plugins „inside“ 64bit projects without resorting to a bit bridge, which tend to be notoriously unstable.</p>
<p>&#8211; Plain and simple, some instruments simply work better in an external host. Sounds weird, but it’s the truth.</p>
<p>&#8211; Last but not least, externally hosted instruments can also mean externally hosted as in „on a different machine“. As you will see (or probably already know), this is dead easy. If set up right, there is no visible or audible difference between instruments hosted on your DAW and instruments hosted on another machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
<p>Before having a look at the various methods of creating an externally hosted template, lets briefly look at some of the technical aspects. Like with most software applications, a template requires CPU power and lots of RAM as well as fast storage. All this also applies to running individual virtual instruments, but in the case of templates it is much more pronounced.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Memory (RAM):</strong> As discussed in part I, a template contains all the instruments/articulations you commonly use, quite often multiple patches with the same articulations from different libraries. In any given piece, you will end up just using a subset of all that is there. Even though it is possible to largely purge the unused samples from memory, all these instruments still need a sizable amount of RAM to stay loaded. For creating a template, having as much physical (!) memory as possible is a must. For a small orchestral template, figure in at least 16GB. That will leave a bit of headroom for the sequencer and Operating System. 32 GB is pretty decent and 64GB will allow you to host a pretty large template on a single machine. While speed is important, size is more. You will not see a huge difference between RAM clocking at 1600 MHz or 1800 MHz. But you will feel the difference between 24 and 32 GB!</li>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> Most sample-based instruments use scripting for producing the sound you want to hear. That means that every time you play a patch, some CPU cycles will be used for calculations inside the script. Fortunately, almost all libraries are programmed relatively well so that CPU time is only used when the instrument is actually doing something. Unless you happen to use one of the rare exceptions or use VIs that use CPU power all the time, your CPU load should not be much higher than on regular projects even with a large template. Figure in some additional CPU load for the hosting software, but all in all CPU cycles will be the least of your problems.</li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong> With rare exceptions, sampled instruments only load a small part of the full sample into the system memory. The rest is streamed from disk while playing. This small part at the beginning, called the preload buffer, serves to give the sampler something to play while it is loading the rest of the sample when needed. How well this process works largely depends on how fast your drive is able to read the rest of the file. If it is not fast enough, you will hear clicks, pops or missing notes. If that happens, the preload buffer needs to be increased. If you have a very fast drive, you can lower the preload buffer greatly. So, in a nutshell: The faster your drives are, the less data you need to load into memory and the more instruments can you load in total. That means that while drive speed is about as important as it is with regular projects, your template will nevertheless benefit greatly from fast drives. Obviously SSDs are best, but expensive.</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong> Should you wish to host parts of your template on another machine or even multiple machines, depending on the method used you will need additional hardware. If both MIDI data to the template and audio data back to your sequencer are handled via LAN, you will need an ethernet cable to connect the machines. If you have more than one slave machine, use a switch to connect. If you also need to get audio back separately to the sequencer, you might also need an additional audio interface. Make sure all network cards involved support gigabit speed. Also use compatible Cat5 or Cat6 cables. There is very little you can do wrong here, fortunately. Sometimes onboard network chips have issues like constant crackles or pops. If that happens to you, simply get a dedicated network card.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>External Setups</h2>
<p>When setting up a template where the instruments are hosted outside your sequencer, there are four different setup styles. Each way to set things up has advantages (+) and disadvantages (-). Usually one template will mix these approaches depending on the nature of the instruments to set up:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hosting instruments/patches outside the sequencer: What you do here is have as many instruments as possible running outside the sequencer. MIDI gets sent to the instrument, its audio comes back. Very easy and straightforward.
<p>+ Easy to set up, everything inside your sequencer feels as usual, no changes in workflow<br />
&#8211; Requires a lot of audio tracks going back into the sequencer, thus very heavy on the network when using slaves</li>
<li>Like 1, but with grouped audio channels: Instead of having each instrument’s audio going back to the sequencer separately, you can group instruments together. This may be on a smaller scale like all Flute patches together, or much broader, for example all high woodwinds. Primarily it depends on how similar the instruments are in usability and how much your connection can still handle.
<p>+ Saves a lot of audio tracks, lets you adjust whole instruments quickly.<br />
&#8211; Individual instruments can not be processed separately. Make sure to only combine instruments that will receive the same post-processing.</li>
<li>Post-processing outside the sequencer: Instead of getting the direct plugin audio back on single tracks (1) or grouped (2), especially for large templates it can make sense to to do all needed post-processing of the sound outside of the sequencer. This includes panning, adding reverb, EQing individual instruments and maybe even some light compression on some sounds. This means that what goes into your sequencer is the production-quality final sound, ready for export. This approach makes most sense if the FX chain stays the same all the time with no tweaks needed.
<p>+ What you hear is the final sound. Set it up once, have it in all projects.<br />
&#8211; Making changes can be cumbersome; exporting the untreated sound means switching stuff off in the template.</li>
<li>Audio to a different application/output: If you are the lucky owner of a kick-ass mixing desk or use special software for that purpose (for example a dedicated PT rig), you can also route the audio to this external source directly from the template instead of first feeding it back to your sequencer.
<p>+ As flexible as you can get in terms of routing<br />
&#8211; Harder to set up; also it usually requires some sort of external audio interface or virtual audio cables (like JACK).</li>
</ol>
<p>So much for today. I hope you got some idea of how to approach planning a template. In part III, we will have an in-depth look at the most popular solution for building templates, VSL Vienna Ensemble Pro 5 before finally planning an example template in part IV. Until then, keep writing great music! As always, write your feedback and questions in the comments.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[One of the most underrated applications on the planet, iTunes can be a powerful tool for finding reference material and inspiration in a heartbeat. This article as the first in a series about iTunes for Composers shows you how.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With a shiny new version of iTunes just having arrived from Apple’s secret labs, the timing is just perfect to introduce you to this software as a powerful tool for organizing reference material. iTunes is maybe the most underrated and misunderstood application on the planet. Many people just see it as a way to fill their iPhones. While it certainly is pretty good at doing that, it also can serve as a tool to give you access to music you might want to listen to for inspiration. iTunes also works great for cataloguing your own work for reference, but we will come to that in a future article.</p>
<p>So what are we talking about here? I don’t know about you, but at least I am constantly prompted to cal up this or that film score. People say „I want something like XY did in that film!“. Fortunately, with a big record collection, I usually have that particular score at hand &#8211; now all I need is to find it. Also quite often I search for inspiration in my collection. I want to listen to a bunch of horror film scores, but don’t know any particular names of films or composers. Or maybe I remember which year that particular album was from, but not the name. Either way, iTunes can help in these situations, provided that you organize your collection efficiently.</p>
<p>In this article I will show you a number of tips and tricks for making iTunes effortlessly present you with exactly what you are looking for when searching for inspiration.</p>
<p>1) Tag your stuff: It may be painfully obvious, but still most people do not correctly tag their music. Every track should have as much information as possible, including composer _and_ artist(s). If multiple artists (for example soloists) perform in one album, give all of them a common album artist. This will keep your albums together. Also fill out the year and CD number as well as track number tags. These are very important for finding tracks quickly.</p>
<p>2) Use the grouping for combining different sections of a work: The grouping tag is the most important tag for quickly finding tracks that belong together. For classical works, place the composer in this tag, followed by the name of the work. For example „Elfman &#8211; Serenada Schizophrana“. You can then just have the title of the movements in the track name and do not need to clutter six or seven tracks with the title of the work, followed by the movement title. This also allows you to at a glance see all the recordings you have of a particular work by just searching for its grouping.</p>
<p>3) Unify names: Quite a lot of names can either be spelled different ways (take Russian composers, for example: Shostakovich vs. Schostakowitsch) or are susceptible to being spelled wrong (for example Bernard Herrmann has had gruesome things done to this first and last name!). This happens a lot even on commercial releases &#8211; I have even seen an album in a major music store by „John Wilaims“. At least they were consistent in spelling the poor man wrong in the whole booklet, too. Check this &#8211; nothing is worse than frantically looking for that Michael Giacchino album which you absolutely know to have in your library, but not finding it, because the man is misspelled. This is double worse &#8211; and embarrassing &#8211; when happening in front of a client.</p>
<p>4) Use album covers: Many of us are visual thinkers. Having album covers for every album is a bit of work, especially if you need to scan in covers of rare to find albums, but especially in the light of iTunes 11’s reliance on a grid of covers as the main method of navigating, it is simply a must. Album covers also go a long way to bring as much of the good old vinyl days to the digital age. As artists we should always make sure to include cover art with albums as a token of respect for the talented people who created this artwork.</p>
<p>5) Use the sorting tags: In the track info window (Apple/Cmd-I) you will find a large number of tags that are used for sorting albums. You can use these to influence the order in which your albums are displayed inside the library. Basically what iTunes does is use those tags (if present) for sorting, but will still use the regular tags when displaying the albums. As an example, if you have an album called „X“ and call it „A“ in the Album for Sorting tag, it will appear under the letter „A“ inside your library, but will still be called „X“. These tags are extremely useful when grouping together albums that belong together in a series in a particular order, but would be sorted differently because of their names. One such series of film scores that comes to mind is Harry Potter. „C“ comes before „S“ or „P“ in the alphabet, so the second film (Chamber of Secrets) is sorted before the first (Philosopher’s/Sorcerer’s Stone). Just name them „Harry Potter 1“and so on  as the Album for Sorting and you are done. You will find that searching for „Chamber of Secrets“ will still have the album turn up in the search results because iTunes searches all tags by default and the sorting tags do not override the regular tags as far as searching is concerned.</p>
<p>6) Use unused tags: Chances are high you never need that BPM tag. Firstly, the BPM tend to change quite frequently in our kind of music. Secondly, you are unlikely to ever need to play your newest film score at the hottest club in town, where beat-matching is a must. Use this tag for organizing your music. You might for example enter the shelf number that particular CD is stored on, or the hard drive number where the cue is located. Anything that has numbers.</p>
<p>7) Use TV tags: Every file in iTunes can have the tags reserved for TV shows, even if it is not TV show or even a video file at all. Of course when cataloguing music for TV shows it makes perfect sense to use these tags. Enter the season, the episode number and additional information. For all other files, use these tags for other information, like the director of the movie, or the scoring stage the album was recorded at.</p>
<p>8) Be creative with genres: If you mainly have film scores in your library, there is no reason to leave the genre for all of them as „Soundtrack“. Firstly, as we all know, it is sort of incorrect because the soundtrack is everything you can hear, not just the actual score; secondly it makes no sense to have „Alien“ in the same genre as „The Sea Hawk“. Change the genre to „SciFi“ or „Golden Age“ and, voilà, searching for „Golden Age“ will magically pull up all scores fitting that era.</p>
<p>9) Understand the search function: The one basic thing about iTunes’ search to know is that it uses the „AND“ operator by default. So when looking for „Jerry Goldsmith SciFi“ it will pull up all tracks that have these two terms somewhere in their tags. „Alien“ will be in there; „Freud“ not so much. You can also search for ratings: „Alan Menken ****“ will pull up all albums with his name and four stars.</p>
<p>10) Make Smart Playlists: There will be an additional article about some Smart Playlists that have proven indispensable for me, but here’s my favorite: Make a playlist with the condition „Last played more than a year ago“. You will discover tons of great music that you haven’t listened to in ages. I guarantee you will immediately feel inspired to write the next big thing!</p>
<p>I hope these ten tips sparked your interest in iTunes and helped you get your collection up to speed. Stay tuned for more about collecting research material &#8211; and let me know what you think in the comments!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In the second part of his tutorial, composer Derek Bourgeois deals with integrating VSL Vienna Instruments into Sibelius 7.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>This article is a guest post by composer Derek Bourgeois</strong></p>
<p>_______________________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let us look at how you would do this process using Vienna Symphonic Library.</p>
<p>The principal is exactly the same, but the interface looks very different.   You have to load Vienna Ensemble Pro before you start to create your instance.  You create the instance and link it to Sibelius.</p>
<p>Let’s take my Instance ‘VSL Percussion 1’.  You start with a blank canvas and add instruments one by one except in VE Pro you are able to name them as well. In ‘VSL Percussion 1’ I have a sundry collection of 16 assorted percussion instruments as you can see from the picture below.</p>
<p>You create your instrument by clicking on the little icon bottom left of the dialog. You assign the name and the channel, then you select either the Matrix or the specific patch and drag it into the area top left of the screen.  You can test it in a similar way to the way you tested it in EW Play.</p>
<p>Having created your instance you go back into Sibelius, and in exactly the same way you create a manual sound set for that instance selecting the soundset appropriate for the instance (in this case the soundset is VE Percussion).  Not all the sounds will be definable in preferred sounds because they are not all defined in the soundset that VSL provides (though I am assured that this will be updated soon), so a lot of them have no sound IDs available in the manual soundset dialog and although you can tell  preferred sounds.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../2012/10/17/how-to-use-external-vsts-with-sibelius-7-part-1/vsl-1-ve-pro-interface" rel="attachment wp-att-1838"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1838" title="VSL 1 VE pro interface" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/VSL-1-VE-pro-interface-389x446.png" alt="" width="389" height="446" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/VSL-1-VE-pro-interface-389x446.png 389w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/VSL-1-VE-pro-interface-640x733.png 640w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/VSL-1-VE-pro-interface.png 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a></p>
<p>Here is the Manual sound set dialog and you can see that a lot of the sounds simply have (none) as their sound ID.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../2012/10/17/how-to-use-external-vsts-with-sibelius-7-part-1/vsl-percussion1-manual-soundset-dialog" rel="attachment wp-att-1837"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1837" title="VSL Percussion1 manual soundset dialog" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/VSL-Percussion1-manual-soundset-dialog-389x290.png" alt="" width="389" height="290" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/VSL-Percussion1-manual-soundset-dialog-389x290.png 389w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/VSL-Percussion1-manual-soundset-dialog-160x120.png 160w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/VSL-Percussion1-manual-soundset-dialog-640x478.png 640w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/VSL-Percussion1-manual-soundset-dialog-300x224.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/VSL-Percussion1-manual-soundset-dialog-260x194.png 260w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/VSL-Percussion1-manual-soundset-dialog.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a></p>
<p>So for the moment I am going to show you various tweaks to persuade Sibelius to play the correct sound.</p>
<p>Let’s start with channel 3 which you can see from the VSL editor dialog is a Bass Drum although it is simply ‘percussion’ to the manual soundset.</p>
<p>You tell preferred sounds that for Bass drum which Sibelius defines as unpitched.drum.low.bass drum.concert.* It must use VSL Percussion 1</p>
<p>The Mixer duly obeys this when you create a bass drum stave having selected it from the Add instrument dialog.  But the mixer has no clue as to which channel to use, because as far as it is concerned it’s just percussion.  So it will very likely pick the wrong channel and the sound will come out as anything found in the instance (in my case it usually sounds like a snare drum which is channel 2 not 3).</p>
<p>The first line of defence is to tell the mixer to use channel 3, and in most cases this will work, but, alas, not always.  Even if it does work, you may prefer to use a particular one of the many bass drum sounds that the VSL patch has loaded.</p>
<p>So the next step is to highlight the stave and go into ‘edit instruments’.  Bass drum should be selected so press the ‘Edit Instrument’ button.  It should then appear as Unpitched Percssion in the next dialog.  Click on ‘Edit Staff Type’ and you will see something like this:</p>
<p><a href="../../../../2012/10/17/how-to-use-external-vsts-with-sibelius-7-part-1/bass-drum-edit-instrument" rel="attachment wp-att-1827"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1827" title="Bass Drum Edit Instrument" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Bass-Drum-Edit-Instrument-389x412.png" alt="" width="389" height="412" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Bass-Drum-Edit-Instrument-389x412.png 389w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Bass-Drum-Edit-Instrument-640x678.png 640w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Bass-Drum-Edit-Instrument.png 824w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a></p>
<p>Let’s concentrate only on the first entry which is notehead type 0.</p>
<p>Select Choose Sound and select VE Percussion as your soundset.</p>
<p>What you will see is bewildering in the extreme as you can see below.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../2012/10/17/how-to-use-external-vsts-with-sibelius-7-part-1/vsl-drum-choices" rel="attachment wp-att-1836"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1836" title="VSL Drum choices" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/VSL-Drum-choices-389x195.png" alt="" width="389" height="195" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/VSL-Drum-choices-389x195.png 389w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/VSL-Drum-choices-640x322.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a></p>
<p>You have to select one of the Bass Drum options for your Best sound but in order to decide which one you like best you’ll have to go into the VE Pro editor and try them all out using the keyboard and then remember which note plays the sound you most prefer. Let’s assume this is C#4 which is actually BassDrum secco (although I suspect that plain C4 Bass Drum is more than adequate). Make this selection and save it.  Then go into the mixer and hit Auto for the initial playback device.  This is important, because if you don’t you may well find that the mixer sound test plays a variety of bass drum noises, whereas your stave might sound like anything.  The other day I had an excellent Wind machine sound in the Mixer, and a thumping loud Anvil when the staff played back!</p>
<p>Only if this doesn’t work can you then tell the Mixer precisely what Instance and Channel to use. Having gone through these steps the chances are you’ll get the sound you are expecting.</p>
<p>Sometimes it requires a lot of trial and error to get the Mixer, the staff instrument, and the preferred sounds to agree with each other.  Personally I would very much prefer it if Sibelius allowed you to specify the precise Instance and channel for any particular sound.  This would short-circuit a lot of the problems, though you would still have to use edit instruments to define precisely what sounds you want on which line or notehead.</p>
<p>You may occasionally find, as I do, that sometimes your score overloads any configuration you may have if it has very fast doubled woodwind scales, is full of rapidly repeated notes , trills and especially measured string tremolandos.  The only recourse here is to make a special playback file and thin out all those doublings and duplicates which are not going to make a significant contribution to the playback. This has nothing to do with the amount of RAM you have, merely that you are asking the computer processor to do more simultaneous switching on and off of sounds than it can cope with.  There’s always a satisfactory solution.</p>
<p><strong>Some Extra Hints for East West playback problems</strong></p>
<p>I always find it useful to create a special playback file where you can provide all sorts of tweaks without worrying what the printout will look like. Using East West Symphonic Orchestra beware of the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Flute only goes up to Bb6</em></p>
<p>Do a quick instrument change to Piccolo and back for the very high notes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Contrabassoon will only play up to written Bb3</em></p>
<p>Double up the second bassoon for the missing notes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Solo trumpet has no mute sound</em></p>
<p>Do an instrument change to Trumpet Ensemble which does have a muted sound</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Muted trombone will not play higher than F4</em></p>
<p>Do an instrument change to trumpet ensemble for the higher notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>A <strong>sf </strong>marking in Trombone only produces a note below C3</em></p>
<p>Make the <strong>sf</strong> inactive by using the Inspector and put in a hidden accent</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Violins, either solo or ensemble, will not playany note above C7</em></p>
<p>The only recourse here is to have a hidden staff dedicated to VSL or Sibelius 7 Sounds and put the non playing notes on this staff and hide them (unless it’s a dedicated playback file where it doesn’t matter what it looks like).  Most violin concertos and Brahms symphonies have violins going higher than C7. A serious omission in my view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Violas are far too loud relative to the other strings</em></p>
<p>Reduce the mixer volume, but beware of muted sounds where the normal balance is restored.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Sibelius' ability to use 3rd party VST instruments is a powerful tool for well-sounding playback while composing. Composer Derek Bourgeois in a two-part guest post guides you through his setup for integrating EW Play and VSL VI into Sibelius.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>This article is a guest post by composer Derek Bourgeois</strong></p>
<p>_______________________________________________</p>
<p>In this article I will try and take the user through the various stages of actions needed to use most of the facilities available to create a large orchestral playback using external VSTs and Sibelius 7.</p>
<p>I am confining myself to the VSTs I own myself which are Sibelius 7 Sounds, East West Symphonic Orchestra, East West Symphonic Choirs, VSL Special Edition, and VSL Full Percussion.</p>
<p>Some of the instructions here may well be very familiar to readers, so you may want to select the sections that are relevant to any problems you may be having.</p>
<p>It’s worth saying at this point that to use these libraries successfully you need a fast computer running with a 64 bit operating system and sufficient RAM.  I use 24 GB of RAM, but half that should suffice for most projects.  Also if you have your libraries on a Solid State Drive (SSD) the loading and saving times are dramatically improved.</p>
<p>Sibelius 7 Sounds is different from other VSTs inasmuch as it uses its own playback engine, and allows only one instance to be used because it has built in 128 channels.  The only important thing when the Sibelius Player is added to your sound configuration is to select the correct soundset. To select a soundset double click in the column labelled Sound Set. You should see something like the following depending on which libraries you have loaded.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../?attachment_id=1834" rel="attachment wp-att-1834"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1834" title="Sibelius Player soundsets" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Sibelius-Player-soundsets.png" alt="" width="181" height="139" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sibelius Player does all the rest itself, and if it is the only VST selected you will probably only need the Mixer to adjust playback details and balance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>CREATING AN INSTANCE AND USING THE PLAYBACK DEVICES DIALOG</strong></p>
<p>Using any other VST you have to create an instance using the device that comes with the Library. For East West products this is called Play and for Vienna Symphonic Library you use either Vienna Ensemble, which is free when you purchase any VSL Library, or preferably Vienna Ensemble Pro which is much better because it keeps your instances loaded even if Sibelius is not running and has far more sophisticated features.</p>
<p>An instance is a set of up to 16 channels each of which is dedicated to a particular instrument.</p>
<p>When you buy an East West Library you will also need to buy a Sibelius Soundset for that Library available from the Soundset Project, where you will find brilliant soundset for most of the East West Libraries.  These come with full instructions as to how to create your Play instances that will work with the appropriate soundset for the Library you are using.   the Soundset Project also provides a series of files called multis which load all the sound files that you need for the instance to work.  Basically the first two instances are dedicated to Woodwind, the next two to Brass, the fifth is percussion, the sixth solo strings, and the seventh ensemble strings.  These instances are used by the soundset to activate effects such as mutes, pizzicato, flutter-tonguing and a host of other effects, as well as choosing the correct instance and channel for every normal instrument automatically.</p>
<p>Assuming you will have followed all the instructions correctly you may then want to create additional instances of your own using non-standard instruments that are available in the library. I suspect that most of these extra instruments will be less often used percussion, so I will take you through how to create an extra instance.  You can name your instances by double clicking on the Device name and I have named mine Play 1 through 7 which are  the soundset&#8217;s own instances, and an extra one of my own called Play 8.  I will take you through how I created Play 8.</p>
<p>Firstly you have to invoke Play/Playback devices which is brought to the screen by clicking the (very) little arrow in Sibelius 7/Play/Setup You will then see a screen like this (you will see that I have created a lot of instances many of which I will describe later.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../?attachment_id=1830" rel="attachment wp-att-1830"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1830" title="Playback Devices" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Playback-Devices-389x290.png" alt="" width="389" height="290" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Playback-Devices-389x290.png 389w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Playback-Devices-160x120.png 160w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Playback-Devices-640x478.png 640w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Playback-Devices-300x224.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Playback-Devices-260x194.png 260w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Playback-Devices.png 926w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a></p>
<p>To create my Play 8, first you have to invoke the Play setup screen by clicking on the Show button.  You then have to load into Play 8 all the instruments you want in that instance and select a channel for them.  You will see below that my first instrument is a harpsichord, and I selected it by choosing the correct Drive letter where my Library is stored, then selecting the Correct Library (in this case East West Symphonic Orchestra Platinum Instruments) selecting Platinum Strings and then Harpsichord and finally Harpsichord.ewi which is the file containing the necessary data for the harpsichord to play.  I then have the opportunity of loading or replacing the existing entry.</p>
<p align="center"><strong><a href="../../../../?attachment_id=1832" rel="attachment wp-att-1832"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1832" title="Play Harpsichord 1" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Play-Harpsichord-1-389x324.png" alt="" width="389" height="324" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Play-Harpsichord-1-389x324.png 389w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Play-Harpsichord-1-640x533.png 640w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Play-Harpsichord-1.png 910w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a> </strong></p>
<p>You can test the sound by clicking on the notes of the keyboard you can assign the MIDI channel using the button to the mid left of the screen.  But if you want to do anything cleverer you click on the button on the top marked Player.  You will then see this.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../?attachment_id=1829" rel="attachment wp-att-1829"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1829" title="Play Harpsichord 2" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Play-Harpsichord-2-389x322.png" alt="" width="389" height="322" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Play-Harpsichord-2-389x322.png 389w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Play-Harpsichord-2-640x530.png 640w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Play-Harpsichord-2.png 924w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a></p>
<p>You can see from this screen that you have the ability (if you wish) to fine tune just about every aspect of the sound.  You repeat this process to create all the other sounds you want in this instance (up to 16).</p>
<p>But this won’t work yet.</p>
<p>You have to create a manual soundset using the Manual Sound Sets tab in Sibelius Playback Devices in which you instruct Sibelius what sounds you are going to use for that instance.</p>
<p>You will need to select the Device (Play 8), the sound set (EWQL Play v3).  You have to tick the “Use manual sound set box, select the number of channels you are going to use (in my case 8) then channel by channel you select the Program name from the drop down box.  You can test this to make sure the sound you hear corresponds to what you expect to hear. Then you must apply it.  Gradually you will build up the list that you see on the right of the dialog. (see below)</p>
<p><a href="../../../../?attachment_id=1833" rel="attachment wp-att-1833"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1833" title="Program name selection" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Program-name-selection-389x407.png" alt="" width="389" height="407" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Program-name-selection-389x407.png 389w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Program-name-selection-640x670.png 640w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Program-name-selection.png 909w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a></p>
<p>But you’re not done yet.  The relationship between the Manual sound set and the Sibelius mixer is a very delicate one, and for the sound to have any chance of working correctly first time round when you apply it to your score, you have to tell Sibelius what your preferred device is for that sound ID.  This is where things get complicated because although you can tell Sibelius what instance to use from which VST you can’t tell it which channel.  The preferred sounds and mixer work on Sound IDs and if you have a load of different percussion sounds in one instance, to the mixer these are often just percussion and it’s likely to get the channel wrong, and this is where it can get frustrating at times.  I’ll come back to this aspect later to tell you of the various ways I have found to overcome the problems that I have encountered.</p>
<p>This is a sample of what I have in my preferred sounds.  Don’t overlook this step because it is extremely important for preferred sounds to the bulk of the selecting work for the mixer. (see below)</p>
<p><a href="../../../../?attachment_id=1831" rel="attachment wp-att-1831"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1831" title="preferred sounds" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/preferred-sounds-389x287.png" alt="" width="389" height="287" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/preferred-sounds-389x287.png 389w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/preferred-sounds-640x473.png 640w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/10/preferred-sounds.png 924w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Making a large template work well without hiccups, but still not demanding extremely powerful hardware is no easy task. But fortunately it is a task where there is plenty of room for optimizations. This article shows you a few tips and may come in handy.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Most composers rely on custom composing templates for their work. No matter how we set them up, whether simply by feeding back audio channels into our master machine, or using specialized software such as VSL’s Vienna Ensemble Pro &#8211; they allow us to have the tools of our trade at our disposal at the click of a mouse. But the bigger these templates get, the more important caring for it and optimizing it will become.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As someone who has had the chance to set up quite a sizable number of composing templates with the help of VE Pro, I’ve had my fair share of bottlenecks that can really bring a template to a crawl. Fortunately, there are a few things you can do to make everything work as smoothly as possible. This article is based on Vienna Ensemble Pro 5, but most things mentioned here will probably also work with either VE Pro 4, or a completely different hosting software. You may even be able to use some of the tips when working solely in your sequencer.</p>
<p>A tiny bit of terminology: The machine where your sequencer (Logic, Cubase, Studio One,…) runs on is called „DAW“ in this article, which stands for Digital Audio Workstation. Any additional machines used for hosting instruments or for applying FX are called „Slave(s)“.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1) Planning a template:</h3>
<p>Before even thinking about building a template, you need to be aware of what you want to have in there. This is extremely important; not just to save time during the actual process of building the template (we’ll come to that in another article!), but also in making sure everything performs nicely. Regardless of whether you want to use external hosts like VE Pro or have everything sitting in your sequencer, the most important point to think about is load distribution. Spread your instruments over multiple instances of Kontakt/Play or whatever sampler you are using. If using VE Pro or similar software, do not fit everything into one single instance, but spread it a bit so that each instance has a bit to do all the time and not just one single instance working away like mad. If you have very CPU-intensive instruments, it can make sense so spread a single library over multiple instances of the sampler. You might for example want to have all your Violins and Violas in one Kontakt instance, with a second instance housing the Cellos and Basses. This way, the CPU load is distributed across two instances and consequently two cores.</p>
<p>Balancing the load gets even more important when using slaves. Make sure each machine shares an equal workload. It does not make sense to dedicate one machine solely to Sough-East-Carribean Bongo tremolos and other „esoteric“ sounds, unless you really need them daily. As a rule of thumb, I try to have the bread and butter sounds of one section as well as some more special instruments from another section per slave if enough slaves are available. So slave 1 would for example do all the basic woodwinds and some brass effects and the big taikos. Slave 2 has the basic brass sounds and more special woodwinds like alto flute, contrabassoon and some tuned percussion. And so on…  Of course how you spread things totally depends on the available resources and your way of working. Just try to balance things evenly. I know it is tempting to say „this machine does all the strings“, but this is not the best idea: As soon as you have a solo string piece, this one machine needs to do all the work and the rest sits around idle. Slaves give you the unique advantage of doing their own processing &#8211; they can be loaded to the brim and the DAW won’t even notice a hit in performance! Again more about this in greater detail in a later article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2) Using fast drives/SSDs and adjusting the preload buffer:</h3>
<p>Most sampled instruments only load a bit of the sample material into the system memory and stream the rest from disk. The amount of what is loaded into memory is determined by preload buffer setting. I have found that it most of the time is set relatively high and can be lowered a fair bit even if you are using conventional hard drives. In fact, I still have a „green“ energy-saving drive in daily use and it performs remarkably well. If you use very fast drives (10.000rpm conventional drives or SSDs), you can set this preload buffer even lower. Lowering it means that your loaded samples consume less memory at the expense of your sampler needing to read much more directly from disk. Toy around with this setting and see what works for you. If you get crackles, pops, lost notes and other issues, raise it a bit.</p>
<p>In Kontakt 5, you will find the preload buffer setting in the options inside the Memory tab. By default it is set to 60kb; on regular 7.200 rmp drives you should be able to pull it back to at least 40 or even lower on pieces not requiring every single instrument to play at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../?attachment_id=1768" rel="attachment wp-att-1768"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1768" title="Kontakt - Preload buffer" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/t_load_kontakt_preload-389x246.png" alt="" width="389" height="246" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/t_load_kontakt_preload-389x246.png 389w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/t_load_kontakt_preload-640x405.png 640w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/t_load_kontakt_preload.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a></p>
<p>Vienna Instruments (Pro) has a similar setting in its options, accessible by clicking the little gearwheel icon:</p>
<p><a href="../../../../?attachment_id=1771" rel="attachment wp-att-1771"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1771" title="VI Pro 2 - Preload Buffer" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/t_load_vipro_preload-389x425.png" alt="" width="389" height="425" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/t_load_vipro_preload-389x425.png 389w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/t_load_vipro_preload.png 476w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a></p>
<p>Again experiment with the settings to see what works for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3) Switching off unused or unnecessary articulations/mic positions:</h3>
<p>Sounds painfully obvious: It makes no sense to have stuff running you never need. If possible, switch off any articulations you do not need. Many sample libraries allow you to unload unused articulation directly within the plugin GUI. If that does not work, use the „Purge all“ feature if such a feature is present in the sampler you are using. Kontakt, for example, has this ability: Click „Purge all samples“ in the purge menu and Kontakt will unload all samples. Samples will then be reloaded while you use the instruments on a „need to“ basis.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../?attachment_id=1769" rel="attachment wp-att-1769"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1769" title="Kontakt - Purge feature" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/t_load_kontakt_purge-389x101.png" alt="" width="389" height="101" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/t_load_kontakt_purge-389x101.png 389w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/t_load_kontakt_purge-640x167.png 640w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/t_load_kontakt_purge.png 641w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a></p>
<p>If you are using reasonably fast hard drives, or even SSDs, this process should be instantaneous. In any case, it saves you a ton of loading times after reloading the project and you can be sure that only the samples really needed in the project use up memory.</p>
<p>Most libraries also have the ability to unload unused microphone positions. Especially if you are using a 3<sup>rd</sup> party reverb quite heavily, switching off highly reverberated samples with lots of room information can not only save you a lot of memory, but also make your mix less cluttered. If you have a rather wet library or microphone position (i.e. one with lots of room information bakes into the samples), after applying a reverb, you basically have two rooms at the same time: The room where the samples were recorded and the room your reverb adds. Especially when using special positioning and reverberation tools such as VSL MIR Pro with 3<sup>rd</sup> party sample libraries, it is often a good idea to only use the close microphone position, if one is available. VSL MIR in particular works best with extremely dry samples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both tips 2 and 3 do not directly influence CPU load, but they do indirectly: With a lower preload buffer, CPU load will increase a tiny bit because more stuff needs to be loaded. This effect, however, is negligible in most cases. Having less articulations loaded reduces the amount of samples that need to be loaded. And reducing the number of active microphone positions means less samples need to by played at the same time when pressing a key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4) Only switch on multicore support for one host:</h3>
<p>Most hosting applications and samplers today have multicore support. That means that they will intelligently balance their workload over all available cores of your machine. Some also allow you to specify a number of cores for the application to use. While this in theory is all nice and well, the cold harsh reality quickly shows that these multicore balancing features tend to get in each others way. One practical example: If you host Kontakt 5 within VE Pro 5, by default, both applications have multicore support enabled. It is my experience that CPU consumptil will drop noticeably when you either switch off multiprocessing in Kontakt, or alternatively in VE Pro. In my experience, setting VE Pro to use 2 threads per instance and switching off Kontakt’s multicore support works best, but you should definitely try this for yourself!</p>
<p>You can find the relevant settings in VE Pro’s and Kontakt’s Options:</p>
<p><a href="../../../../?attachment_id=1770" rel="attachment wp-att-1770"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1770" title="VE Pro - Multiprocessor support" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/t_load_vepro_multicore-389x137.png" alt="" width="389" height="137" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/t_load_vepro_multicore-389x137.png 389w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/t_load_vepro_multicore.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="../../../../?attachment_id=1767" rel="attachment wp-att-1767"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1767" title="Kontakt - Multiprocessor support" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/t_load_kontakt_multicore-389x246.png" alt="" width="389" height="246" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/t_load_kontakt_multicore-389x246.png 389w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/t_load_kontakt_multicore-640x405.png 640w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/t_load_kontakt_multicore.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a></p>
<p>Especially on OSX, if your VE Pro instances consume 10-20% CPU per instance when doing absolutely nothing, this will most likely solve the issue! I have so far not seen any performance impact by switching off multicore support &#8211; on the contrary. If you are running parts of your template in the DAW, make sure to experiment a lot with different multicore settings: Having both VE Pro (or any other host) as well as your sequencer running, both of them probably offering support for threads, it might even make sense to deactivate multiprocessing support completely in the sequencer. I have made very good experiences doing that with Cubase, especially on the Mac.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5) Bonus Cubase Tip: Use only 8 MIDI ports for VST3:</h3>
<p>This one curiously enough has crept up at least a dozen times in the last two weeks: Many people using Cubase with very large templates have only two or three VE Pro instances, because the VST3 version of VE Pro allows the use of multiple MIDI ports. Consequently, they use a lot of ports &#8211; the highest I have seen was 64 MIDI ports per instance.</p>
<p>(Let us briefly hold a minute’s silence for all Logic and DP users out there stuck with just 1 MIDI port as part of the Audio Unit plugin standard. Ok, minute over.)</p>
<p>Cubase users with lots of MIDI ports face the issue that their templates will take ages to load. This is due to a behaviour of Cubase that makes it take a very long time to initialize any VST3 plugin that exceeds 8 MIDI ports. What I have heard is that Cubase somehow initializes all the additional ports and checks their allocations. The first eight MIDI ports are not treated this way. This is why it makes sense to only use 8 MIDI ports per VE Pro instance and in order to be able to have the number of instruments required, use more instances with 8 ports instead of just a few instances with 64 ports.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, only Cubase shows this behaviour. Users of Studio One (which is also able to use VST3 plugins) can use 64 ports without overly long loading times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you found this article informative. In due course there will be a second one with some planning advice for templates, as promised earlier. Post your feedback and questions in the comments and I’ll be happy to address it.</p>

<p><a href="http://soundcloud.com/" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a> is a versatile and effective platform for composers and sound content creators of all kinds, and is arguably the next big thing in online audio. Over the last year and a half I have invested hundreds of hours on SoundCloud and would like to spend a few minutes with you to share a few nuggets I&#8217;ve picked up along the way, that may help you as a composer, and that may shed some light on the community aspects of the service, as well.</p>
<h3>Ten Point Briefing</h3>
<ol>
<li>SoundCloud is an audio platform for sharing, promotion and collaboration, with its own social networking framework.</li>
<li>SoundCloud is accessed via desktop web browsers, embedded webpage widgets and smartphone apps.</li>
<li>SoundCloud began as a music file sharing service in Berlin in 2007, by Alexander Ljung and Eric Wahlforss, growing from 1 million members in May 2010 to 9 million members in December 2011.</li>
<li>Members can upload sound files in all common formats, with public or limited visibility, downloadability and all common licensing options, Buy links and a vanity URL, for example soundcloud.com/the-chemical-brothers.</li>
<li>Tracks can have players embedded on external websites with flexible appearance and browser compatibility options.</li>
<li>Members can follow other members, provide feedback via timed comments, mark tracks as favourites, keep abreast of other member activity on a dashboard, and create and join groups.</li>
<li>Detailed stats are available, showing who played your track, where, when, how often, and who downloaded or saved your track to their favourites list.</li>
<li>SoundCloud is well integrated with Twitter, Facebook and other online social networks. At the Facebook f8 conference in September 2011, Facebook announced a strategic technology partnership with SoundCloud, effectively providing SoundCloud embedded exposure to over 800 million Facebook users.</li>
<li>Membership is free but there are premium accounts ranging from €29 to €500 offering various levels of storage, stats, widgets, support and other options.</li>
<li>Finally, and crucially, SoundCloud is a community.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Who Uses SoundCloud?</h3>
<p>Essentially, sound content creators of all types, and listeners of all tastes. From dance music producers like Deadmau5, Skrillex and Swedish House Mafia to A-list pop stars like Lady Gaga, Radiohead and Bjork, from indie singer/songwriters to podcasters, comedians and even newspapers like The Economist, and of course composers.</p>
<p>I asked a handful of film and television composers to share their experiences of SoundCloud, starting with LA-based Kerry Muzzey, who enjoys the community-oriented learning and social aspects of SoundCloud:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I have fallen in love with SoundCloud. I&#8217;ve enjoyed it not only for the many musical discoveries I&#8217;ve made but also for the ability to interact with other composers. I love that so many have been willing to share their tech tips and secret recipes. Sure, it&#8217;s a really simple and slick demo-hosting site: but take some time to go a little deeper and you&#8217;ll be surprised at the community you&#8217;ll discover: these are people who are passionate about music and about the beauty of sound.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Sean Beeson from Ohio has over 400,000 track plays on SoundCloud and gains from the marketing aspects it offers:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I use SoundCloud to gauge the success of my online marketing campaigns. I can see what sites people are accessing my music from, where in the world they are listening from, and what music the are listening to. It helps me to cater my sets to what music is most listened to in the hopes that I can gain greater exposure for my work.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Geographically, members are spread across the world in roughly the following order: US, UK, Germany, rest of Europe, Canada, Russia, Australia, Japan, rest of world.</p>
<p>UK-based Marie-Anne Fischer, film and television composer and chapter director of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/composium/" target="_blank">SCOREcast: London</a>, has experience with a number of online music platforms including ReverbNation. Marie-Anne shared a little about using SoundCloud for professional showreel and private sharing purposes:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I discovered SoundCloud <em>about 10 months ago </em>when I started writing demos for Sonokinetic because they use SoundCloud to post their demos. I like the direct connection and simplicity. SoundCloud is becoming more interesting to me as I have found more film and media composers on SoundCloud than I had on ReverbNation. I like the group features on SoundCloud where there is no clutter. I tend to be using SoundCloud more recently to link prospective clients to my showreel and being able to share private tracks is a great feature.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Given the fact that there are over 9 million members, of course not all members are professionals in the line of work they present on SoundCloud and membership is arguably weighted towards amateur enthusiasts, but that does not detract from its usefulness in professional spheres.</p>
<h3>Can SoundCloud Help Your Career?</h3>
<p>SCOREcast: London&#8217;s own Dominik Johnson, world music production specialist:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>SoundCloud, for me, is one of the best community music tools online at the moment for the pro musician / composer / producer. I know the audio quality on my music (typically 48kHz/24bit) can be lost with some of the upload compression, but to me, that’s a price worth paying. A few months ago an independent film director from Berlin got in touch after hearing a few of my works on there, we got chatting on there, then we starting having Skype calls – and BOOM! I’ve been commissioned to write some tracks for his upcoming feature documentary – and yes, his production team does have a budget for the music.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Dominik touched on a point above with regards to upload/playback quality, which I&#8217;ll explore in the Technical section further below.</p>
<p>I know of one case where the SoundCloud user was not necessarily the <em>beneficiary</em> of a career opportunity. LA-based film composer, orchestrator and conductor Deon Vozov has this story:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>For me as a composer, no, there&#8217;s nothing that&#8217;s happened on SoundCloud without my initiation that&#8217;s led to a contract. However, because I also do some small music supervision work, I have FOUND tracks on SoundCloud and gotten them placed in projects. The first few were free, but there are starting to be licensing gigs that pay a little something, help build reels, and feel more dignified. And believe me, it is much more fun to approach people with money than with &#8220;it&#8217;ll be good for your reel&#8221; statements of questionable accuracy.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Deon continues with an interesting point about the depth of SoundCloud&#8217;s penetration into the upper echelons of film-making:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>My clients seem to fall into two categories: producers and directors who are very, or at least comfortably, familiar with SoundCloud but not very well-funded yet, and producers and directors who’ve never heard of SoundCloud but can cut those juicy checks we all love to then spend getting the job done.</em></p>
<p><em> In other words, my experience has been that it&#8217;s still not an industry standard in audio post production. By gently guiding clients towards it, however, I think it will become more so.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Offering more insights than I could ever have hoped for, Deon goes on to make a point about visual versus audio impact of a demo reel:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>That said, it&#8217;s not selfless support of SoundCloud that has led me to steer clients to the site. Rather, I like to link even initially skittish clients, and potential clients, to private sets here because <strong>it gets them focused on listening with their ears rather than their eyes </strong>[emphasis mine]. </em></p>
<p><em>Everyone wants video links, and they will tell you with a straight face that they&#8217;re really listening to the music, and they really do believe that they&#8217;re telling the truth when they say that. But the reality is that these are highly visual, highly visually sensitive, and highly visually creative people experiencing audio tracks by way of how they feel about picture. </em></p>
<p><em>It is possible to separate picture from music, of course, but difficult, and it will always imprint indelibly upon the track. That can work in one&#8217;s favor (an expensive car spot, for example) or against it (a feature that suffers a malaise of some kind or other). By sending clients to a simple, easy-to-navigate, custom-built set, they have an interactive experience and can jump around in the set to find what they want to discuss and, if they&#8217;re bold enough to create an account, they can even leave timed comments for us to discuss in relation to their project.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Many of the responses in this section came to me as a result of engaging with the community on SoundCloud directly by publishing a track inviting my followers to share their stories as timed comments. Here&#8217;s a handful of other stories, in brief:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Uploaded 1st track, surprised by response. Uploaded more. Got made Soundclouder of the Day and then featured on SoundCloud <a title="SoundCloud Tour Page" href="http://soundcloud.com/tour" target="_blank">tour page</a>. Label emailed me and now I have two releases out.<br />
— Russell Knight, London</em></p>
<p><em>A few months ago Norwegian Landscape photographer Ole Salomonsen approached me via SoundCloud, asking if he could use my track &#8216;Counting Stars&#8217; on his latest vid of the Northern Lights. My first piece of paid work.<br />
</em><em>— Mei-Ling Grey, London</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Amidst the success stories, two cautionary tales emerged:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I believe I did *not* get a gig because of the music in my SoundCloud profile. I was considered during the final round of applicants, and <em>when asked for a portfolio I </em>directed them to my SoundCloud profile. Something like two days later I found out they gave the job to someone else. </em><em>This has led me to reassess the quality of the work I upload to SoundCloud, even though it could be that the work I have on my SoundCloud is quite different from the piece I made for that job.<br />
</em><em>— Rodrigo Hernández, Mexico City</em></p>
<p><em>I signed a contract with a company called [redacted] who have a group here on SoundCloud about three months ago. I had to go to a notary and everything, alas I have not heard from them since and they don&#8217;t reply to my emails.</em><br />
<em>— Andy Carter, Cornwall, UK</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The insights I&#8217;ve gained from these last two are to keep one&#8217;s SoundCloud profile tidy and focused on the target market, and to know who you&#8217;re dealing with.</p>
<p>One reason I&#8217;m able to share this article with you today is that my own case is potentially one more success story to emerge from SoundCloud, but this is not about me so I&#8217;ll save that for the end.</p>
<h3>How SoundCloud Compares to Other Audio Platforms</h3>
<p>In the user content audio hosting space, SoundCloud competes with, among others, BandCamp, ReverbNation and Myspace.</p>
<p><strong>BandCamp</strong> is mainly focused on allowing independent artists to sell their work, and are funded in part on a commission basis. Users can customise the look and feel of their music pages and have their tracks downloadable in many formats. BandCamp has attracted some commercially established artists including Amanda Palmer to abandon their labels and self-promote (interestingly, Amanda Palmer also has a <a title="SoundCloud: Amanda Palmer" href="http://soundcloud.com/amandapalmer">SoundCloud account</a>).</p>
<p>Jeremiah Pena, SCOREcaster, says:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I like Bandcamp. I don&#8217;t get as many track plays as Soundcloud, but it&#8217;s my main method of selling music to the general public, which SoundCloud doesn&#8217;t seem to do very well. It&#8217;s also very useful for building email lists, since you can have people supply an email address for free downloads. And it&#8217;s free, with no major limits like the free version of SoundCloud. I&#8217;m able to put a lot more music than I could there.</em></p>
<p><em>I do find SoundCloud much better for getting feedback and it has very good community features (commenting, groups, etc.) that Bandcamp doesn&#8217;t have.</em></p>
<p><em>— Jeremiah Pena, Film Composer, Utah</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In terms of usefulness to composers, BandCamp may serve a function to sell original soundtracks if the production licensing terms permit, but since BandCamp does not offer embedded players, the composer would have to set up a specific BandCamp page outside their main website, which may not be a desirable solution for those who like a one-stop-shop approach to their web presence.</p>
<p><strong>ReverbNation </strong>aims to provide a collaboration and communication platform as well as music hosting for independent artists, and have an embeddable player.</p>
<p>SCOREcast&#8217;s Marie-Anne Fischer knows ReverbNation well, having ruled the London and UK Classical charts with a regular #1 spot. In her words:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I started using ReverbNation in 2009 because I was able to link my playlist to my Facebook profile as an app. I wasn&#8217;t particularly interested at the time in having a Facebook fan page, so this was a great alternative. Unfortunately Facebook subsequently took away the ReverbNation band playlist feature from personal Facebook pages. &#8216;My Band&#8217; feature could only feature in a fan or group page but I was still able to use the widgets and apps for posting new tracks.</em></p>
<p><em>ReverbNation has been great for meeting musicians and I have already collaborated with a couple of them. During 2009 and 2010 I made great use of my ReverbNation site, my website is linked to my profile which I pay for annually.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Marie-Anne also offers us a comparison with her SoundCloud experience:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You can personalise ReverbNation&#8217;s profile which you can&#8217;t on SoundCloud but that hasn&#8217;t stopped me from using SoundCloud.</em></p>
<p><em>I like the statistics SoundCloud collects and provides me and also their feature where people can favour a track and leave a comment.</em></p>
<p><em>The great big difference between SoundCloud and ReverbNation is that SoundCloud is purely functional and works well where as on ReverbNation you can add your personal touch to your profile, link music to multiple stores, integrate with other websites, create newsletters, blogs and apps are only but a few of their features.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Marie-Anne is right about SoundCloud being less customisable than ReverbNation, which takes a modular approach to the profile page with a lot of control over content and branding. On SoundCloud, personalisation can be applied to player widgets for website-matching style and colour scheme, for user dropbox page branding, for linking other profiles like Twitter, Facebook etc. and for essential items like profile image and an HTML-enabled description area.</p>
<p>In terms of how that translates into commercial opportunities, I would argue that for a composer it is the presentation of your professional website that is more important than the presentation of your profile on the audio hosting website, but that can be debated in the comments below.</p>
<p>One other factor to consider is the service value available to non-paying customers. Although ReverbNation&#8217;s free account allows more tracks to be hosted than SoundCloud&#8217;s free account, the size of each track is limited to 8MB which forces lossy upload format; the longer the track the lossier it has to be to fit into 8MB.</p>
<p><strong>Myspace</strong> does not make for great headlines these days, having been sold to News Corporation for $580 million in 2005 and then bought by Specific Media and Justin Timberlake in 2011 for $35 million. But as a music hosting social networking site with 33 million unique US visitors in August 2011, it cannot be ignored in this comparison.</p>
<p>Oxford-based soundtrack composer, electronica producer and SCOREcast reader &#8220;The Unfinished&#8221; (Matt Bowdler) shared his experience with me:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Myspace, I haven&#8217;t used for a long time. It may have improved, but I think it has been superceded by SoundCloud from a music hosting perspective and Facebook from a community perspective. The options were limited (I think ten tracks was the maximum) and it just got incredibly spammy. Endless messages from people who were plugging their latest track or gig that was almost always a genre that bore no relevenace to what you were doing. Quite a bit of spam from Myspace themselves as well. Put quite simply, there isn&#8217;t anything that Myspace does that isn&#8217;t done better elsewhere.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I think Matt&#8217;s view is shared by many in the music community including myself: That Myspace is not necessarily the most strategic technology partner for a professional composer. If you disagree, please share your experience in the comments below.</p>
<h3>Technical Considerations</h3>
<p>How do you get your SoundCloud tracks on your web page? SoundCloud makes it simple.</p>
<p>You can embed SoundCloud widgets in several sizes and styles, with both Flash and HTML5 options. HTML5 is more mobile browser-friendly, especially on iPhones and iPads which can&#8217;t play Flash, but some older browsers (e.g. IE6) can&#8217;t view HTML5.</p>
<p>To embed a track or set, use the Share menu item at top left of the track or set to access the widget options, customise to taste.</p>
<p>Here are some Flash and HTML5 examples of embedded track players.</p>
<h4>Flash examples</h4>

<h4>The main technical issues reported by professional SoundCloud users are well-known and steps have been taken to address them.</h4>
<p><em>1. SoundCloud playback is compressed at 128kbps, which many audiophiles can discern distinctly from studio-quality uncompressed recording.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In previous email exchanges, SoundCloud staff let me know that they&#8217;re always thinking of and considering ways to make the experience better for both creators and listeners. One way for creators to offer higher quality is to enable downloads for their sounds so listeners can access the file in its original quality. They&#8217;re regularly discussing this topic internally and are considering changes in the future.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In the meantime, SoundCloud seems to remain the platform of choice for many sound libraries&#8217; demo tracks, including Sonokinetic, 8dio and others, which is a good indicator that the quality, although not perfect, is widely acceptable for professional demo purposes.</p>
<p><em>2. Flash-based SoundCloud players are subject to the inherent stability and compatibility issues of Flash, particularly where smartphones often have trouble showing Flash controls.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">SoundCloud recently released HTML5 versions of their embeddable widgets, addressing both the stability problem and making it compatible with most smartphones and mobile devices including iPhones and iPads. The new HTML5 widgets have been well-received and many say better looking than their Flash predecessors.</p>
<p><em>3. Some users reported that the encoding produced glitchy playback, particularly in high frequency ranges and at high volume levels.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Up until recently, SoundCloud advised: &#8220;This rarely happens but if it does, we suggest uploading in 320kbps 44.1kHz with at least -3dB of headroom&#8221; but a recent discovery has revealed that this is no longer required.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FLAC is the recommended upload format for optimal playback quality, but this may not be ideal for download purposes and is probably best-suited for playback-only tracks (non-downloadable). For people who would prefer to have their files available for download, the higher the quality of the lossy file they upload, the higher quality the encoding will be.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The <a title="SoundCloud: Help" href="http://help.soundcloud.com/customer/portal/articles/94796" target="_blank">Help Page</a> on this topic offers this advice:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Sometimes our transcoding system can create audio artifacts, as we transcode all tracks to 128 kbps mp3 for streaming playback. Uploading a lossless or high-quality lossy file will usually reduce these to a minimum, but unfortunately there&#8217;s not much we can do for the handful of individual tracks that are still affected.</em></p>
<p><em>If you choose to make your track downloadable though, the version users can download will be an exact copy of the version you uploaded, without any transcoding.</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is an important point with regards to using SoundCloud for track sharing between yourself and the film production co, or for demo or collaborative purposes: <strong>The track you download is the exact track that was uploaded, regardless of the playback encoding</strong>. So you can happily share your 192kHz 32-bit float wav file if that tickles your fancy, in full trust that that is how it will be received. You can also do so in complete privacy without violating your NDA.</p>
<p><em>4. SoundCloud has experienced unscheduled downtime in the past.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For 24 hours in October 2011, SoundCloud fell victim to an aggressive DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack leading to slow response times and occasional periods of downtime.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">No data was lost in the attack and no user profile security was compromised, but better measures have since been put in place to defend against future attacks of that nature. Unfortunately, no website is untouchable from such an attack attempt.</p>
<h3>My SoundCloud Story</h3>
<p>I joined SoundCloud in August 2010 and from the start had a revelatory and inspirational experience, so much so that by New Year&#8217;s Day 2011 I resolved to turn my life-long passion and hobby into a career. This I knew would be a long path but one that would hopefully be rewarding at every step of the way, and as 2011 passed by, I reflected on those intentions in confidence that things were finally moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>My first steps on SoundCloud were like most others—a one-way path of uploading music and hoping it would be heard and liked by someone, somewhere, just as most creative artists hope for their own art to be observed and appreciated. It only really happened for me when I realised that it was more than a music hosting site but a community as well.</p>
<p>And so I started engaging in-depth with other people&#8217;s music—going through their entire track lists to understand their own creative processes and leaving comments and, drawing on my own experience, leaving constructive feedback along the way. This revealed the reciprocal nature of SoundCloud interaction when all of a sudden my own tracks started drawing a lot of attention.</p>
<h4>Community</h4>
<p>The third stage of my SoundCloud involvement began in June when I decided to try tapping into the collective creativity of the SoundCloud community.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first crowd-sourcing project was extremely simple: &#8220;I invite you to suggest a name for this track&#8221;. SoundCloud staff noticed this, thought it was a cool idea, and tweeted it to their then 80,000 followers. My track got absolutely bombed by name suggestions and the winning title and subtitle were really well-suited to the track (<a href="http://soundcloud.com/oliversadie/namethis">White Light Rendezvous: For Those Who Follow</a>). With around 200 followers at the time, I then gained another 200 or so on the back of that mini-project.</li>
<li>The second project was a little more ambitious. I played a 9 minute piano improvisation and called it &#8220;I invite you to suggest an orchestral composition with timed comments on this track.&#8221; This got a lot of attention too with comments like &#8220;a harp arpeggio phrase for next 8 bars&#8221; and after about 100 comments I spent a month composing those elements over the original piano improv. I called the resulting track <a href="http://soundcloud.com/oliversadie/scs">&#8220;SoundCloud Sinfonietta: You Composed This&#8221;</a> which quickly racked up over 5,000 plays and was a finalist in the <a href="http://www.g-technology.eu/competition/">G-Technology Europe Driven Creativity Awards</a>.</li>
<li>The third project is still on-going and is called <a href="http://soundcloud.com/oliversadie/your-tune">&#8220;Your Tune&#8221;</a> where I invited followers to share a 20-second solo melody and composed a full-length orchestral or band instrumental track using the submitted melody.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Career Break</h4>
<p>As well as the community projects I run on SoundCloud, I also produce a lot of original work and get involved in many collaborations. Through a friend on SoundCloud, one of my original tracks <a href="http://soundcloud.com/oliversadie/ochre-threads-piano">&#8220;Ochre Threads&#8221;</a> was heard by an independent filmmaker in LA, also on SoundCloud, who is working on his 3rd feature-length film and wanted to use the track for a particular scene.</p>
<p>The same filmmaker then spotted a track I released in December 2011—<a href="http://soundcloud.com/oliversadie/of-valour">&#8220;Of Valour&#8221;</a>—and on the strength of that alone gave me the opportunity to score the entire feature-length film, due for release in Summer 2012.</p>
<p>This is potentially the career break I&#8217;ve dreamed of for many years and could be my ticket to full-time paid filmscoring work in the future.</p>
<h3>SoundCloud Communities</h3>
<p>Apart from members who used underhanded spam-like tactics to drive playcount and visibility, the most active and successful accounts are those of people who take the time to listen and provide feedback to other SoundClouders. The communities thrive in the timed comments, the track favouritings, the collaborations and in groups, especially those which have forum-like chat areas. There are also regular live meetups across the world, like <a href="http://blog.soundcloud.com/2011/10/13/soundcloud-global-meetup-day-review/">this one</a> in October 2011, which Yoko Ono got involved in too.</p>
<p>Naturally I prefer an organically grown community to one built on spam and follow-backs, and contributed <a href="http://soundcloud.com/101/community-building">&#8220;How to Grow Your SoundCloud Community&#8221;</a> to SoundCloud HQ, which they keep on the front page of the user guide here: <a href="http://soundcloud.com/101">soundcloud.com/101</a></p>
<p>The SoundCloud community is well supported by dedicated community teams with staff in Berlin, London and San Francisco, headed by <a title="Europa Award Winners 2011" href="http://theeuropas.com/2011/11/peer-index-wins-the-grand-prix-as-the-europas-awards-drifts-eastwards/" target="_blank">Europa Award-Winner</a> <strong><a title="David Noël" href="http://david-noel.com/" target="_blank">David Noël</a></strong>. The team actively promotes community projects via their <a title="SoundCloud Blog" href="http://blog.soundcloud.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>, <a title="Facebook: SoundCloud" href="http://www.facebook.com/soundcloud" target="_blank">Facebook</a> page (500,000+ followers) and <a title="Twitter: SoundCloud" href="http://twitter.com/SoundCloud">Twitter</a> account (150,000+ followers), for example a global project collecting translations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in as many languages as possible.</p>
<p>One very charming aspect of the <strong><a title="SoundCloud: Community Team" href="http://soundcloud.com/community-team" target="_blank">SoundCloud Community Team</a></strong> is their daily SoundClouder Of The Day nomination, where a member is singled out for their community activity or other unique attribute that deserves recognition. SCOTD alumni are then often contacted for input on community questions and feedback, and are given a little boost in follower-ship by means of a shoutout on their social networks.</p>
<p>&#8220;This Week in SoundCloud&#8221; is another community project highlighting interesting discoveries across the &#8216;Cloud, in podcast format on a weekly basis (incidentally, the jingle for this podcast was written by me and 2 other SoundClouders).</p>
<p>There is a lot to the SoundCloud platform, it is not just an audio widget on your demo page. I&#8217;ll end where I began: SoundCloud is a versatile and effective platform for composers and sound content creators of all kinds. It is arguably the next big thing in online audio, and maybe most important&#8230; it <em>is</em> a community.</p>
