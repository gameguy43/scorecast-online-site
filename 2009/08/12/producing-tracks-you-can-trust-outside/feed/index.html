		<description><![CDATA[Houston&#039;s right... Don&#039;t forget, Jim, we are talking about TELEVISION here, not the average feature film schedule, which yes, you would be stupid to not have someone else mix your cues. On a TV schedule, however, more often than not, there is simply no time to outsource a mix because by the time you finish the score for an episode, you are up against dub time, maybe even a day or two into it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a normal (and I use that term almost &quot;comedically&quot; in regards to television!) TV post schedule, I think Houston might be right - the more you know, the better it will go.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s really nice in theory, Jim - but in the world I live in - I&#039;ve only got time and budget to do everything on my own, end-to-end. I imagine that a lot of other working composers are in the same boat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think it&#039;s often a false choice that many composers make, to dodge part of the equation that&#039;s not as interesting or seems too difficult at first. Some may not go &quot;as far down the rabbit hole&quot; as those of us with hard-core engineering chops, but as I said before, the 80/20 rule applies. Making just a few adjustments in the studio can make a huge difference in the transferability of your mixes to survive better in the wild.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let&#039;s not forget that in most cases our cues *are* going to professional mixers - but in our case they&#039;re *not* necessarily interested in helping make our music better - they&#039;re more interested in moving quickly and getting on to the next show/episode. The *last* thing you want is to create more work/hassle for them and increase the odds that the producers will go to their Rolodex to find another composer because it&#039;s less work to do *that* than rescue your cues every week.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can highly recommend three other books that shed a lot of light on these topics, and many others:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- Izhaki, Roey (2008).  &lt;i&gt;Mixing Audio:  Concepts, Practices, and Tools.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- Everest, F. Alton (2007).  &lt;i&gt;Critical Listening Skills For Audio Professionals.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- Rumsey, Francis (2001).  &lt;i&gt;Spatial Audio.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One other thought, in response to the worry that there&#039;s too much to learn.  I tend to think that maybe there really &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; too much to learn.  Perhaps a composer needs to decide who she or he really wants to be, and make that the priority -- because, for most of us, we really &lt;i&gt;can&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; do everything.  So, for example, when it comes to getting a good mix, maybe we really should recognize that there are other people who specialize in that area and are equipped for it -- and hire &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; to do our final mixing.  In other words, I think that if one really wants to be a composer, he or she should be careful not to let all the energy be drained away by trying to do too many things.  Focus first on learning to write good music.  My two cents.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Believe it or not - I *too* still feel overwhelmed by this subject. One of the reasons why I bought Bob Katz&#039;s book was so I could go back and refer to it over and over again. There are things in there that I didn&#039;t understand a few years ago, that I am able to grok now. I had a boss that referred to this type of learning process as &quot;taking a sip of water from a running fire hose&quot; - more of it goes over your head to begin with. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But like I said in the article, the immediately useful stuff becomes clear fairly quickly, since most of us have some kind of environment where we can hear the results. That&#039;s the good news. And the better news is that you *don&#039;t* have to be some golden-eared freak and go to insane ends to make a difference in your studio. The 80/20 rule definitely applies here - 20% of the effort/knowledge will likely yield 80% of the benefit.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey James. Thanks for the kudos - your article &quot;Love Boat in 7.1?&quot; was part of the inspiration for the deep dive. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gear listing in this area is a very slippery slope. A lot of it has to do with budget, and with speaker monitors it can vary so widely that a solution that corresponds to one budget level wouldn&#039;t make sense at another. Even in home/independent studios the band is wide enough that you can run into giving good advice for one situation, and the same thing would be bad advice for another. Then there&#039;s the whole host-dependent aspect. Some solutions [even free ones] might be VST-only, and still others might be great for AU or RTAS based hosts. Then there&#039;s the hardware solutions, where certain studios hang an analog meter right off the main output buss, and simply run their studio speakers through dedicated monitor buss control hardware. I do the same thing &quot;inside the box&quot; with Nuendo&#039;s Control Room, and there are some really nice pro-sumer level monitor controllers, but most times they are coupled to a speaker vendor&#039;s product line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can start with some of the pointers I link to in the article. I think Bob Katz&#039;s chapter on speaker calibration from &quot;Mastering Audio&quot; might be published on his site as a web article. You can also find links to free metering plugins on &lt;a href=&quot;http://KVRAudio.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;KVRAudio.com&lt;/a&gt; that I&#039;ve never tried, but some of them look pretty cool. Then there are the vendor sites, which can have a lot of good information about speaker selection and placement. Here&#039;s one for Genelec that is really well done - much more concise than I can be. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.genelec.com/learning-center/speaker-selection-guide/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.genelec.com/learning-center/speaker-...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And of course, the final factor is just plain appetite - do you, as the composer, have enough interest in this subject to do things piece by piece, or are you more of the type to pay for tools/consulting that does most of the heavy lifting for you? For better or worse, it&#039;s a relatively open set of factors, and cheat sheets don&#039;t have a lot of pass-around value.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re absolutely right. I completely forgot about my trusty laptop &quot;speakers&quot;, which are probably just a pair of Radio-Shack quality piezo transducers glued to the mesh grill on the laptop&#039;s body. I remember making a mini amplifier in an electronics class that used two of those piezos, and it actually worked. Of course, I blew mine up after about 20 minutes of pushing it, but I learned a lot in the process. I have no idea how I was graded, but it was fun. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My laptop is the acid test for material I mix for the web.

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jai - you&#039;re welcome! FWIW, you could very well be in the correct power band for the music you&#039;re making and still end up with ear fatigue. Some music demands to be played loud, since that&#039;s the style in which the audience hears it. Oddly enough, it was Bob Moog that pressed that point to me during college. When you see a gray-haired old man shouting, &quot;Dammit, it&#039;s the medium that matters!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Jai &#8211; you&#39;re welcome! FWIW, you could very well be in the correct power band for the music you&#39;re making and still end up with ear fatigue. Some music demands to be played loud, since that&#39;s the style in which the audience hears it. Oddly enough, it was Bob Moog that pressed that point to me during college. When you see a gray-haired old man shouting, &#8220;Dammit, it&#39;s the medium that matters! If it&#39;s music that meant to be played loud &#8211; PLAY IT LOUD!&#8221; you tend to listen. </p>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the kudos, Lee. There&#039;s a ton of useful info coming out this month. (Props to Deane&#039;s article &quot;Scoring Through the Droughts&quot; for an incredibly well-written piece on motivation) I kind of ran a little bit long with my article than originally planned, but felt like it was worth the stretch to put things in context.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    I think mixing on headphones is largely a mistake. Even if you&#039;re just tracking, you tend to make instrumentation and arrangement decisions based on an inaccurate view of how much the voice fills the mix. That&#039;s just inviting more work down the road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Also, the stereo image ends up being pinched - since the speakers are now at 90 degrees to your head, you tend to drive things to the middle in order for things to &quot;sound right&quot;. Then when you go back to speakers everything has collapsed to the center and you can even get into issues of getting in the way of things that *should* be in the middle that you&#039;re covering dialog (or a lead singer, as the case may be).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    You can get a pair of head worn monitors that more closely approximates the way in which speakers reach the head naturally, but they&#039;re very expensive and I&#039;m always suspicious of their acoustic efficacy. It&#039;s bad enough trying to do big room mixes in a small studio - there&#039;s no sense in blowing the dough on something the increases the odds of a mistake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then again, I suppose that if someone listens to enough reference material on headphones and makes the same kind of mix decisions that match those references, I suppose they can come close to something that will transfer. I&#039;ve read articles about how Europeans (and in particular, Germans) have a very headphone-friendly audiophile base. If that&#039;s the primary medium in which the material is to be heard, then I cannot argue against using them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as a substitute for proper studio monitoring, that&#039;s a stretch that I can&#039;t make.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[SO MUCH crucial info here. SCOREcast is stepping it up this month (if I can say that without sounding immodest)!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Thanks, Houston… and IMHO it&#039;s an especially important point you make when you mention how to balance our expenditures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    I can&#039;t tell you how many times I&#039;ve walked into the studios of friends and colleagues and seen them playing around with the Latest and Greatest sample libraries—but mixing &#039;em on a consumer-level set of computer monitors (!). Just brutal. Every time I ask about it, the answer is something like &quot;Well, I can get a good idea of how it&#039;s going to sound if I go into headphones…&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Any thoughts on this? I was pretty harsh on them when they offered up this opinion—was I wrong? Does headphone monitoring have any relation to the Real World?]]></description>
