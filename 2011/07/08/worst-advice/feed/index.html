		<description>I like #2 the best. I&#039;ve been wrestling with the idea of writing some library music for fear that it would make me a &quot;library guy.&quot; This was based on the advice of some older composers I&#039;ve worked for who are very clearly locked into a niche that they&#039;ve created over several decades. But when speaking with younger composers who&#039;s careers are starting to take off, they were all diversifying their portfolios at my age, doing library stuff as well as assistant work as well as indies etc. It sounds like &quot;diversifying&quot; is one of the most important things for the beginning composer to take into account. Great list, thanks a lot!

		<description>Hey Greg,

Not to plug shamelessly, but I write about a lot of that kind of stuff on my website http://deaneogden.com. It&#039;s geared toward the Creative Community at large, but ALL of it pertains to us as composers. Also, &quot;The Conversaton&quot; newsletter on my website is ALL about work/life balance-type issues.

The work/life balance is a tough one. I&#039;ll post about it soon again on my site. But yeah... you and I should get together and go blowing! lol I just recently went through a similar experience as you. We should chat face-2-face over that Glendale neighborhood beer we&#039;ve been talking about!</description>

		<description>Your repsonse makes me wish you would write a bit about maintaing balance between life and composing. I&#039;d like to believe I don&#039;t have to give up my aspirations for having a wife, a family, just because I followed my dreams. But after just loosing a wonderful relationship in part for my inability to give her the time together she needed, I worry for my ability to balance this demanding career and my personal life.

		<description>Change is a hard thing for most people to get use to Jarkko.  Many see this as a poor time to be a beginning composer because the &quot;old model&quot; for how things work is no longer working and many do not know how to adapt and change with it.  But I for one see this time (while not easy)...invigorating. The future is what we make of it.  The important question in my mind is...is this your passion?   If it is...you are doing the right thing.  Keep pursuing it at every turn and kink in the road.  Feel free with the new frontier of where the industry is headed and feel comfortable knowing that if this is your passion (which I am sure it is)...then you must follow it to its logical conclusion at all costs.  Only then will you (and everyone else doing the same thing)...be truly happy in life.

Cheers!

		<description>After reading a rather discouraging thread with comments on how it&#039;s a poor time to be a beginning composer over at a forum for film composers, this post gave me some encouragment again, even though not addressing the current state of things that much. But as a general guide this was a nice reading. Thanks for this!</description>

		<description>A lot of people have bought into a lot of these things, Mike, INCLUDING ME when I was just getting going! It IS all about pacing—realizing for REAL where you are at and not trying to get ahead by hacking the system (the &quot;system&quot; is too smart for that) or cutting corners (people *will* notice... and then you&#039;re sunk!).


Keep keepin&#039; on, my friend!DO</description>

		<description>Hey Thomas!

I&#039;m sorry to have missed you during your trip to LA. Hopefully you are making some pals at Chris&#039; place and settling into a nice cozy circle of peeps! m/

I want to provide a little bit of different view to your &quot;creative capital&quot; idea. I agree to a certain point, but after that I think it is wise for a composer— especially one who is just getting started—to really stay away from taking gigs based solely on that creative criteria. I think it used to be more valuable 10 to 15 years ago to take gigs based on their creative value or production value, but today, it really isn&#039;t. It would make more sense for you to take a gig based on WHO is working on the project, rather than whether the project &quot;looks&quot; or &quot;plays&quot; better than some of the others you&#039;ve done recently.Even if you consider the quality of a project to be a &quot;step up&quot; from what you&#039;ve done, if all it is going to do is play at a small festival, it is rarely ever worth it. Now, you never know which projects are going to &quot;break&quot;, so I could be all wet here. However, I don&#039;t think I am: The odds of something breaking with a visionary director versus the odds of something breaking because it is a small step above your last film are vastly greater. If your last film was something nobody will ever see, chances are that this one won&#039;t be seen either... UNLESS the director is on the radar of up-and-comers. If that is the case, PLEASE take the gig!

Just a thought on your thought. Not sure if it&#039;s valuable or if I&#039;m even making sense, but to me... it makes a lot of sense: If the money isn&#039;t there, where does the next trigger point fall into place? For me that would be &quot;career trajectory&quot; reasons over &quot;quality&quot; reasons. Relationships over visual quality.</description>

		<description>Hey man!

I actually think age has ZERO to do with getting there. I personally think that if you have the goods, people will eventually notice, no matter how old you are.I have heard the occasional comment over the years that this is a &quot;young man&#039;s game&quot;, but to be perfectly honest, I haven&#039;t heard that as much as I&#039;ve heard that it is a &quot;single man&#039;s game&quot;, which I tend to agree with a little bit more. Most people just getting started tend to find the hard work, dedication, and hours of the job to be quite a bit more demanding than they originally thought it would be—especially if that also includes a recent move of them and their family to Los Angeles to pursue the gig. Like I mentioned in the post, that sort of move is painfully jarring at best and requires a great deal of planning to do right. Even still, it can take a toll on personal time, family obligations, etc. I think it is much easier to move here without a family in tow than to worry about the age at which you make the move or try to &quot;break in&quot; to the business. I know guys who were in their 50&#039;s before they scored anything &quot;high profile&quot;, and of course we all know there are guys who were barely out of school that have been given a shot as well.</description>

		<description>Hi Deane,

Like everyone has said, I just want to thank you for a really helpful and informative post! I have often read about how much more effective it can be to know what not to do as opposed to what you should. It was a great read and it will be an important reference to me for when I feel like I am ready to make THE move to LA. Your page is my homepage  so it&#039;s always great to open up a browser and find an article so useful for aspiring composers. I look forward to continue reading all the articles you have posted over the years!

Best,
Robin</description>

		<description>Hey Deane,
I was wondering if you think age has any bearing on &quot;making&quot; it in LA? I just turned 42 and am still toying with the idea of leaving Vegas for LA. Not sure if one feature and a few shorts and a commercial is enough to start digging in?
Thanks for any thoughts!
Jeff

		<description>Best Worst Advice ever!  Great to read you again, Deane - insightful and deadly on the mark as always.  The thing it all points to is so much &#039;advice&#039; points to using the same path - especially these days, a surefire way of never getting noticed or getting into a career-killing bottle neck with thousands of other hopefuls.   </description>

		<description>Really great post here, Deane.  I think you touched on all the major conflicts I&#039;m having as a composer.  I dig your down to earth approach in this, especially about whether or not to move to LA immediately.  (for some weird reason I kept imagining you writing this on the Santa Monica beach being fanned by supermodels :)   

I think I resonated most with how you talked about not blaming the Hollywood system at the beginning.  Learning to take responsibility and being realistic about the studio&#039;s &quot;need&quot; for another composer.  Curious how much you see of that in yourself and other budding composers.  

Really enjoy the posts, thanks man!</description>

<p>I think I resonated most with how you talked about not blaming the Hollywood system at the beginning.  Learning to take responsibility and being realistic about the studio&#8217;s &#8220;need&#8221; for another composer.  Curious how much you see of that in yourself and other budding composers.  </p>
<p>Really enjoy the posts, thanks man!</p>

		<description>Hi Deane, 
Great article, you make some salient points. I am an Australian composer currently spending some time in LA on a fact finding/networking mission with a view to relocating here. I&#039;m lucky enough to be staying at a composer residency program which offers cheap accommodation but thats not a long term solution. I think one of the keys to it  is that its a relationship industry and it takes time to build good relationships. I agree with what you say about not taking every gig and not working for no pay, I would like to add that another consideration is the creative capital in a project. If a gig is low pay but the film is of a high creative standard, then its likely that project may get into more festivals and create more waves than a higher paying gig that&#039;s maybe a corporate video. I&#039;d also be interested to know how you feel about the pathway of assisting established composers as a way to get working in the industry? I have heard mixed opinions about this from varied sources.
