Here's what I want you to be thinking about this weekend:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eWho is your competition?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca name\u003d'more'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt's counter-intuitive, but in a way you face greater competition if you're just starting out than if you're somewhat established. Composers have become like lawyers… with more aspirants in training than practitioners making a living in the field. There are more composers on the D-list than the C-list; more on the C-list than the B-list, and so on. So the number of people targeting that $5,000 indie film is actually greater than the number gunning for the $200 million blockbuster. The major pictures are, of course, a much higher-stakes game, but the players at the table are fewer… especially considering that many of the filmmakers who work at that level already have their composer. C'mon, did you really think anyone but James Horner was gonna score \u003ci\u003eAvatar\u003c/i\u003e?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTaking a look at your \"level\" of gig—and don't get me wrong; I think going for projects that are a \u003ci\u003elittle\u003c/i\u003e over your head can be a good thing, if you approach it as a learning experience and a way to force yourself to stretch!—you can quickly assess the level of craftsmanship, experience, studio resources, etc. that you're likely to be facing in the competition. You can find out, in other words, who the competition really \u003ci\u003eis\u003c/i\u003e. That's something you need to know.\u003cbr /\u003eUse Google, social media of all sorts (searching Twitter is a great way to make some progress here)—seek out a couple dozen of your peers, whether you've ever made their acquaintance or not, and take stock. Figure out who the competition really is for the kinds of gigs you're trying to get. Hell, hit up IMDb and find out who got the gigs you didn't… if you're targeting your own demos appropriately, that alone should give you a pretty good view of the terrain.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOnce you've determined that you're safe (for now) from having to compete with the Williamses and the Elfmen of the world, I recommend doing some \u003cb\u003eopposition research\u003c/b\u003e. We all put our cues on websites to be listened to; it's fair game for you to go and listen.\u0026nbsp;Compare your stuff with the competition.\u003cb\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003ePart One\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eof this technique is to play a couple of cues from several people who are at your level… then play a couple of your own cues. A-B. Back and forth. Be critical: Are you doing as well or better in terms of finished musical product? Chances are you're at least close. Congratulations. But don't get too cocky. Focus on the stuff others are doing better.\u003cb\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003ePart Two\u003c/b\u003e of this strategy is more painful, more humbling, but crucial. Play your stuff, A-B, with the composers at the top of the food chain. Producers don't care that you don't have rooms and rooms full of gear, with small armies of studio underlings, to make everything sparkle. They just want their score to KILL. So A-B yourself with the people you think are absolutely the best in terms of writing chops, production quality, dramatic sensitivity. And draw the appropriate conclusions about where you stand. You might even try specifically writing a few cues for your demo as \"\u003ci\u003ex\u003c/i\u003e-killers\" (where \u003ci\u003ex\u003c/i\u003e is one of your favorite film-score cues by a composer other than yourself). See if you can out-do your heroes. Benefit from the fact that they've already done a lot of the hard work by defining the parameters of the cue. Just be sure to do it in a way that conveys your personality. Filmmakers can smell a Thomas Newman-alike or a John Williams-alike a mile off, and they'll wonder if you have anything original to contribute to their project.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut creating amazing music, as we always emphasize around here, is only a part of the equation. You might do well to re-evaluate yourself as a competitor (my \u003ca href\u003d\"../../../../../2009/06/phases-of-game.html\"\u003eblog entry\u003c/a\u003e on this subject is still available, and this might be a good time to take the quiz, if you haven't already).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eEvaluate the competition, too—see what you like about their websites… their online personalities… the way they're leveraging social media. Then simply do what it takes to make your situation better. Use your own taste and your own resources as a guide.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eDefining exactly who your competition is (by how far along you are, what your network of Industry contacts looks like, etc.) allows you to keep one eye on the fellow members of whatever list you honestly think you're on… and it allows you to keep the other eye on the folks at the top of the heap. Two points… that define the line of your own upward progression in this career.\u003cdiv class\u003d\"blogger-post-footer\"\u003e\u003cimg width\u003d'1' height\u003d'1' src\u003d'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2957472132698657339-5787380124065652082?l\u003dwww.scorecastonline.com' alt\u003d'' /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"},"link":[{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2957472132698657339/posts/default/5787380124065652082"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2957472132698657339/posts/default/5787380124065652082"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"../../../../../2010/02/weekend-provocation-whos-competition.html","title":"Weekend Provocation: Who's the Competition?"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Lee Sanders"},"uri":{"$t":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/08035088236361437862"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$extendedProperty":{"xmlns$gd":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005","name":"OpenSocialUserId","value":"15436834845629676295"}}],"media$thumbnail":{"xmlns$media":"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/","url":"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hCspY__CLOo/S2jihWwJ_TI/AAAAAAAAAJM/TWIelOS2Be8/s72-c/sanders-provocation-1.png","height":"72","width":"72"}},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2957472132698657339.post-4059876301759399238"},"published":{"$t":"2010-01-19T09:19:00.000-08:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2010-01-19T09:19:10.653-08:00"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"licensing"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"cues"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"website"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"store"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"sales"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"stock music"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Websites"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Film score"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"stock audio"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"widgets"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"EC"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"music"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"composer"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Moving Up the Ladder"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"Making Money from your Music - Part 2: An Introduction to Selling and Licensing Your Music Yourself"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003ca href\u003d\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/S1XpBQPZsVI/AAAAAAAAARU/SGFeptoAe8U/s1600-h/cooke-ladder.png\" imageanchor\u003d\"1\" style\u003d\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"\u003e\u003cimg border\u003d\"0\" src\u003d\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/S1XpBQPZsVI/AAAAAAAAARU/SGFeptoAe8U/s1600/cooke-ladder.png\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003eSo you've just finished a great cue, and the director decides he doesn't like it at all - \"\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003escrap it, start again\u003c/span\u003e\".

There are literally hundreds of websites out there (\u003ca href\u003d\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_music\"\u003eMusic Libraries\u003c/a\u003e), where you can upload and sell your tracks as mp3 downloads for people to listen to on their ipod, or where you can even license your tracks to potential clients for films, video games, websites and more.  I can't remember where it was, but I read online recently that over 1/3 of the music industry in America is based on music licensing - if thats even anywhere close to being true, it gives you an idea of how big an industry music licensing really is.

Well, firstly you can upload your tracks to different libraries (an overview on that, shown \u003ca href\u003d\"../../../../../2009/09/selling-music-online-stock-audio-market.html\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan id\u003d\"main\" style\u003d\"visibility: visible;\"\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e and sell licenses to use your tracks.  Another way to do it, is to sell music downloads, and/or licenses via your own website.  This can be particularly beneficial if you have a modest amount of traffic coming to your own website from anywhere and everywhere on the web.  I've been experimenting with a number of different ways to sell and license my music in the past two or three years, and I've found a number of different ways to do it.   I've failed miserably in some cases, had some good experiences in others, and also had a great time in the process.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn this article, I'd like to point you towards some of the products that are out there, which can help you achieve another stream of income as a composer - in particular products which will allow you to sell your music online via your own website, rather than uploading to another library and selling directly from their website.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBefore we go anywhere, for those of us who don't know what it is, we have to ask - \"What is a Widget\"?

Custom domain service means that you might own \"\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003ehttp://filmcomposer.com\u003c/span\u003e\" and everytime someone goes to it, it goes straight to your bandcamp site and the domain in the address bar stays as \"\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003ehttp://filmcomposer.com\u003c/span\u003e\" so it looks like its your website.

What this means is, if when you uploaded the tracks originally to you license, you chose the option to not sell the tracks as mp3s, then it will still show up on the player, and when you click on it, it will bring you to amazon.com strangely enough.  I emailed support regarding this, and they told me that if you choose not to sell your music as mp3s for personal listening, then it will still keep the \"buy mp3\" link in the player, but default to amazon.com - it is something they are working on, and hopefully will resolve in the next version of their player - no update on the time frame for that.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUploading to Youlicense was fairly simple - you can either \"hard upload\" (ie. actually upload the tracks) or give a link where the files are located on your server and stream them from there everytime someone listens to them on the youlicense website or via the widget on your website (you need to make sure your server can handle the amount of traffic this can bring).

Therefore, I started to look into other ways to sell music online via your website, and found the following alternatives:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-size: 130%;\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.paypal.com/ipn\"\u003ePaypal IPN\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e - \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eFree\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_HKS3fEP7Plc/S1Smd5GI8XI/AAAAAAAAC5Q/DKhunfgiD30/s1600-h/ipn.jpg\" onblur\u003d\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\"\" border\u003d\"0\" id\u003d\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5428146483361280370\" src\u003d\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_HKS3fEP7Plc/S1Smd5GI8XI/AAAAAAAAC5Q/DKhunfgiD30/s400/ipn.jpg\" style\u003d\"cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 106px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 330px;\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eExample\u003c/span\u003e: \u003ca href\u003d\"http://sonicoctave.com/album.html\"\u003eHere\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ePossibly the easiest way to sell music on your website is via paypal. Paypal offer a very easy way of selling goods online, and receiving payments for them. To sign up for paypal takes only 2mins, and once you have an account, anyone can pay you via their bank account, or credit card (or a number of other ways also). In your paypal account, you can create \"buy now\" buttons, which you can put anywhere on your website, and customise to allow customers to send you money for whatever the product. Another great thing about this system is that paypal actually gives you the option of \"IPN\" (Instant Payment Notification), which can in turn offer \"Digital Delivery\".\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo what does this mean? Basically, lets say you have one track on your website that you want to sell. You create the paypal button, set the amount for $10, and put the button on your website. When someone clicks on that paypal button, they are brought to the paypal website, asked to pay $10, and then get given a link immediately to download the file from, once they have paid. \"Digital delivery\" allows you to accept payment, and send the file to the client, all while you're asleep in bed! Once set up, it automates the entire process, and you can sit back and wait for the money to come rolling in.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://deliveryscript.com/\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-size: 130%; font-weight: bold;\"\u003eDigital Delivery Scipt\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e- \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003e25% off for SCOREcast readers!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_HKS3fEP7Plc/S1S-PIyVEvI/AAAAAAAAC5Y/7x3aYejpHuQ/s1600-h/digitaldelivery.jpg\" onblur\u003d\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\"\" border\u003d\"0\" id\u003d\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5428172618154185458\" src\u003d\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_HKS3fEP7Plc/S1S-PIyVEvI/AAAAAAAAC5Y/7x3aYejpHuQ/s400/digitaldelivery.jpg\" style\u003d\"cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 302px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 400px;\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eDemo\u003c/span\u003e: \u003ca href\u003d\"http://deliveryscript.com/demo/ds-admin/\"\u003eHere\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTheres also a really great script that you can buy and get installed called \"Delivery Script\". I bought this myself originally when I was on the search for ways to sell music online via my website. This script basically makes the entire process of selling your tracks via paypal a HUGE amount easier by giving you a backend administration panel on your website to log into, and create your own links for people to click on. Once they click on the link, they are brought to paypal, asked to pay, and once the payment has been processed and received, they are given a unique download link via email which they can download your track from. Within your admin panel, you can set the generic download time for these links, aswell as a load of other handy options like creating a one-off download link for someone if say they paid you by cash, or somehow a payment went through incorrectly and didn't give them a download link originally.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOh and by the way...did I mention the owner of the script, Yuniar, is giving all SCOREcast readers 25% off the price meaning it is only $30!

Perhaps one of the best examples of these that I have come across would be the \"XML MP3 Store\" by \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.tpnwebdesign.com/\"\u003eTPN Web Design\u003c/a\u003e. The XML MP3 Store is the option I finally went with after trying all of the free options out there in the form of popular 3rd party widgets.....\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe XML MP3 store is quite expensive (usual price of $400) when you compare it to the free alternatives out there, but a closer inspection reveals some really cool features which in my eyes really make it worthwhile.  First off, lets look at the backend/administration panel of the store...\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_HKS3fEP7Plc/S1Wb37XBttI/AAAAAAAAC6M/TVssmM3v2kg/s1600-h/xmlmp3store.jpg\" onblur\u003d\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\"\" border\u003d\"0\" id\u003d\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5428416310994384594\" src\u003d\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_HKS3fEP7Plc/S1Wb37XBttI/AAAAAAAAC6M/TVssmM3v2kg/s400/xmlmp3store.jpg\" style\u003d\"cursor: pointer; float: right; height: 262px; margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; width: 400px;\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003eIn the admin panel, uploading tracks and albums is simple.  Select your .zip file of your album, upload it, then add your tracks one by one.  When uploading your tracks, you are not limited to any price - choose $100 or $1.00 - the choice is up to you, unlike some of the other free widgets which limit you to certain price brackets.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn the general settings, you can input your own paypal email address, so that once someone pays for a track, you are sent the payment immediately to your own paypal account.  Also in the general settings, you can change the currency - the standard is set at US dollars, but you can change it to Euros, Yen, or any other currency out there.  This is handy as if you are located in Europe, and want to price all of your tracks in Euros, rather than using dollars, is a simple click and you're done.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn the admin panel, another great feature is the ability to change the colours of the store - literally every single part of the store is customizable in terms of the colors you would like to use.  This makes it one of the most customizable stores I have found out there .  You can edits the colours in any and every way in order to make it blend in better with your website, making it look a lot more professional in my opinion.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOne more option in the admin panel is the ability to track all of your orders from the store.  You are given the paypal email address, price paid, date, as well as a few more handy options here.  What I like about paypal is that you are given the email address of the person that sent you the payment for your track.  As a composer starting off in the industry, I've found this helpful as I always follow up with people after they have bought a track from me for licensing purposes, to see if they would mind sharing what they've used it for with me.  I can then add this to my demo reel to use later on if needed, and also keep in contact with them and possibly work with them in the future.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe XML MP3 store also has a shopping cart system like other previous stores reviewed, but it is a lot more sleet and professional looking, to my eyes at least. The amount of tracks you \"Add to the cart\", show up just above the \"Featured Albums\" part of the store in the top left hand corner.  Once you view your cart, you can add/remove items, then go to the checkout process at paypal, and complete the transaction.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOh and yet again, for all you SCOREcasters, Thinesh - the creator of the store - is giving you all \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e25% off\u003c/span\u003e, and offers the store at a reduced rate of $300 (just include the code \"SCOREcast\" when you contact him!)

I wouldn't advise you to license your tracks for $20 at all :) Remember to put your PRO/ASCAP etc. number on your website, and encourage people to fill in cue sheets so you are also getting royalties for your music.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eRemember to hit me up in the comments section if you have any questions, or anything to add or say on the subject! :)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-size: 85%;\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-size: 78%;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHandy related articles:\u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.w3schools.com/flash/flash_inhtml.asp\"\u003e Inserting Flash Into HTML\u003c/a\u003e  -  \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.flashfiredesigns.com/resources/ecommerce/paypal_instant_payment_notificiation_setup.php\"\u003e Setting Up Paypal IPN\u003c/a\u003e - \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-size: 78%;\"\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_licensing\"\u003eMusic Licensing Terms\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-size: 78%;\"\u003e - \u003ca href\u003d\"http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/music-licensing.htm\"\u003eHow Music Licensing Works\u003c/a\u003e - \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.masternewmedia.org/news/2008/06/26/music_licensing_future_and_the.htm\"\u003eThe Future of Music Licensing\u003c/a\u003e -\u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.ascap.com/playback/2005/winter/features/cuesheets.aspx\"\u003e Everything You Need to Know About Cue Sheets\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-size: 85%;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv class\u003d\"blogger-post-footer\"\u003e\u003cimg width\u003d'1' height\u003d'1' src\u003d'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2957472132698657339-4059876301759399238?l\u003dwww.scorecastonline.com' alt\u003d'' /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"},"link":[{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2957472132698657339/posts/default/4059876301759399238"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2957472132698657339/posts/default/4059876301759399238"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"../../../../../2009/10/making-money-from-your-music-part-2.html","title":"Making Money from your Music - Part 2: An Introduction to Selling and Licensing Your Music Yourself"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Emmett Cooke"},"uri":{"$t":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/11291437897536505847"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$extendedProperty":{"xmlns$gd":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005","name":"OpenSocialUserId","value":"14679010493746982124"}}],"media$thumbnail":{"xmlns$media":"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/","url":"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/S1XpBQPZsVI/AAAAAAAAARU/SGFeptoAe8U/s72-c/cooke-ladder.png","height":"72","width":"72"}},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2957472132698657339.post-4849371480375630004"},"published":{"$t":"2009-09-07T09:47:00.000-07:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2009-09-07T09:55:33.126-07:00"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Websites"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"DO"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"AICN"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Internet"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"welcome"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"Welcome, Ain't It Cool!"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003cdiv class\u003d\"separator\" style\u003d\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SqU3WWDcYSI/AAAAAAAAAKw/auYnizUhTWg/s1600-h/sig-ogden.png\" imageanchor\u003d\"1\" style\u003d\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"\u003e\u003cimg border\u003d\"0\" src\u003d\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SqU3WWDcYSI/AAAAAAAAAKw/auYnizUhTWg/s320/sig-ogden.png\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI wanted to personally jump on here and join Lee in welcoming all of you \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.aintitcool.com/node/42261\"\u003eAICNers\u003c/a\u003e who might be visiting SCOREcastOnline.com for the first time and tell you all how excited we are that you are here.
