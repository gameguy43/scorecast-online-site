		<description>I just listened to the podcast on workflow, and I really had to pause for thought. My office is at home, and I keep thinking that I need an office away from home to write because of all the distractions of working at home. However, I can see that an office may be more of a hinderance than a help. I also always have Logic up with a piano sample so I can record whenever I have an idea, and an office would kill that creative flow.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I just need a bigger home?! LOL</description>
