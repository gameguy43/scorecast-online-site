<div id='summary1269442576461983690'><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/Suj9fpj61WI/AAAAAAAAAPg/L4afPPjz35s/s1600-h/sig-ogden.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/Suj9fpj61WI/AAAAAAAAAPg/L4afPPjz35s/s320/sig-ogden.png" /></a>Hello SCOREcasters!<br />
<br />
Though I hate to bump my own article from this morning on the SCO front page, we want to engage you in a conversation about an issue that is percolating around our film music community today, and frankly, one that is vital to the future of our profession as composers. If you are one that has been waiting for the right time to join your fellow SCOREcasters in the ongoing conversations happening in the <i>COMMENTS</i> below, there has never been a better time than now.<br />
<br />
If you followed <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118010470.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2563">today's news</a>, you are probably already aware of last night's announcement at the Society of Composers and Lyricists annual membership meeting (of which I was in attendance) that for the last three years, a small ad hoc group of composers has been investigating and exploring the possibilities of unionization by affiliating with Teamsters Local 399.<br />
<br />
So here's the thing: You SCOREcasters have never been a group that runs away from a healthy debate, so let's mix it up. What are your immediate thoughts in hearing this announcement? Given what you do or don&#8217;t know about how unions work, what do you think is the best solution for composers moving forward, and why would you choose that option?<br />
<br />
This is a potential game-changer, folks! You can imagine the arguments for and against unionization in general, but when you add some of the elements of this particular initiative into the mix, the debate intensifies, as evidenced by a few conversations I had with people following the announcement at the SCL event last night.<br />
<br />
In keeping with what has arguably been the political theme of the year thus far, we are at a potential crossroads of &#8220;change&#8221; with this issue. As working professionals in the field of film, television, and video games, no matter what happens and no matter what side of the fence you come down on, whether or not we unionize as a community <u><i>WILL</i></u> affect your work as a composer in this industry. Unionizing under a guild would mean that your working conditions, wages, minimums, health insurance, and pension options would standardize under a collective bargaining agreement with producers and studios. This important issue requires the focus and awareness of every single person working &#8212; or aspiring to work &#8212; in the film music business as a composer.<br />
<br />
That is why I, with the rest of the team here at SCOREcast, would strongly encourage you to attend an important informational meeting that is being held to present all sides of the case for and against unionization. The meeting is being held <b><i>November 16, 2009</i></b> at <b><i>7pm</i></b> at the <i><b>Pickwick Gardens Conference Center</b></i> in Burbank. If you are unable to attend the meeting, keep your browser pointed here at <a href=".">SCOREcast</a> where we will be keeping you up-to-date with all of the latest developments concerning this issue. But, just remember that this <i>IS YOUR ISSUE</i>.<br />
<br />
One of the things that I personally love about SCOREcast is this culture that allows us to express our opinions &#8212; conflicting as they may be at times &#8212; and still maintain our own brand of "unity" at the end of the day. We are all in this together; therefore, there are no wrong answers here.<br />
<br />
The only &#8220;wrong&#8221; would be to not ask these questions. Hit us back in the <i>COMMENTS</i> below and tell us what you are thinking.<br />

<div id='summary5817448669605858267'><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SugT9CENYTI/AAAAAAAAAPY/tutq7K0eqOA/s1600-h/ogden-tao.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SugT9CENYTI/AAAAAAAAAPY/tutq7K0eqOA/s320/ogden-tao.png" /></a>Are you tired of being successful? Do you get sick of directors referring you to new filmmakers? Have you grown bored with watching your film music career speed ahead at a rapid pace?<br />
<br />
Well, now you too can make it all go away by becoming a <i><b>Horrible Collaborator</b></i>!<br />
<br />
That&#8217;s right! Now you can have the same broken dreams that thousands of flaky composers have, all due to your own self-sabotage! Just follow these ten simple rules, and your career as a film composer will be headed nowhere fast!<br />
<br />
<i><b>1. Never Communicate with Your Principals&#8232;</b></i><br />
The surest way to kill a collaboration is to stop talking to your bosses. Imagine how great it will make your director feel to work for months or years on his or her film, having total control over everything... that is until the day they have to hand it over to you, only to have you take it, disappear with it, and never give them any progress reports once you get it into your studio! I&#8217;m telling you, they LOVE THAT! In fact, by the third or fourth phone call or email that has gone unanswered by you, they&#8217;ll love you so much that they&#8217;ll already be talking to their producers about not using you the next time around. Suddenly, you'll be the talk of the town!<br />
<br />
<i><b>2. Avoid Discussing Money At All Costs&#8232;</b></i><br />
Talking about money can be one of the toughest and most uncomfortable parts of negotiating a deal with a filmmaker. So I say JUST DON&#8217;T DO IT! This way, you don&#8217;t have to have that always awkward conversation when you are trying to get hired for the gig, and the producers don&#8217;t have to commit to a hard financial deadline &#8212; It&#8217;s a win-win for everybody! Essentially, you&#8217;ll be working for free until the conversation is finally had, and then you&#8217;ll be negotiating against work already performed. Love that! All in all, it&#8217;s good practice for when you eventually have to sell used cars because the &#8220;composing thing sorta didn&#8217;t really work out.&#8221; Just consider it "training for your future"!<br />
<br />
<i><b>3. Wait Until the Very Last Minute&#8232;</b></i><br />
Everyone loves a procrastinator, especially directors. Do yourself a favor and leave the planning, strategy, and discipline to the Line Producer! The composer has no business being organized enough to stay on schedule... besides, that&#8217;s no fun anyway. Who needs it? Instead, make sure that you spend your writing time playing on Facebook, rearranging the furniture in your studio, and checking out those new plug-ins on the Native Instruments website. Wasted time in the composing chair is the key to a happy director come delivery time!<br />
<br />
<i><b>4. Be as Uncompromising as You Can Possibly Be</b></i><br />
Let&#8217;s face it: <u><i>You&#8217;re</i></u> the music expert, not the director. If the director was the expert, he or she wouldn&#8217;t have needed to hire you in the first place! See how that works? When a director says, &#8220;That just doesn&#8217;t work for me... Can we change it up a little?&#8221;, look at them like they are stupid and say, &#8220;I have it all under control. Maybe you should go see how the color-correcting is coming along!&#8221; This will put them in their place and guarantee that they never ask for another change again. And that&#8217;s what you want: A director that knows their place in your world!<br />
<br />
<i><b>5. Cut Corners on Originality</b></i><br />
I have four words for you: <i>Loops are your friend</i>. I have four more words for you: <i>Don&#8217;t tweak factory patches</i>. Pay attention, kids... I&#8217;m throwing you pearls here! Anytime you can cut corners and skimp on quality, do it. Your director will love it when the same waterphone sound you used in his movie shows up a week later in another score. Another thing that is cool is to hear all of your film composer buddies talk about how you used a factory Taiko drum midi file straight out of <i>SD2</i>. And who knows, maybe you can parlay that into an endorsement from EastWest, to boot. After all, you're just doing your part to put their little company on the map, right?<br />
<br />
<i><b>6. Backstab When It Benefits You</b></i><br />
Since post-production generally takes it in the shorts on budget and time, it is customary for the dub crew, the mixers, and even the editors and SFX guys to badmouth the director and producers at some point during the post-production schedule. My advice? JOIN RIGHT IN! Those kinds of things NEVER get back to the victims, and if they ever do, chances are they&#8217;ll think you were just trying to be a comedian. If there is anyone in this business that checks their ego at the door, it&#8217;s the director and producer. They always have great senses of humor about those kinds of things and they never mind being ridiculed or complained about in front of their colleagues. Ever!<br />
<br />
<i><b>7. Make Sure Everyone Knows You Are Doing Them a HUGE Favor</b></i><br />
Always remember this: It&#8217;s JUST a film! It&#8217;s not life or death, and it&#8217;s certainly not going to matter to any producer if you don&#8217;t stick to the terms set forth in your contract. If you are a couple of thousand dollars over budget, so what? If you are a month late on delivering, wah wah wah!! Everyone should just be happy that they are getting <i>you</i>, and shut their big fat mouths! Besides, this movie wouldn&#8217;t be what it is without <i>your</i> score in it, anyway. You are doing them a big gigantic favor by even working on this thing, so they need to give you your space. Since your so good that they are sure to hire you on all of their subsequent films, maybe next time you&#8217;ll throw them a bone and put a little more effort in. That is, if the budget is what it should have been <i>this</i> time, the cheapos! I mean, my God, what do they think you don&#8217;t need to eat or something?!?! Sheesh!<br />
<i><b><br />
8. Be Unprepared for Meetings&#8232;</b></i><br />
Directors, studio executives, and producers have a lot of time to burn... Probably the most out of everyone on the planet. I mean, let&#8217;s be real: It&#8217;s not like they don&#8217;t have an army of people running around doing all their crap for them all day, right? So, big whoop if they get to your studio for playbacks and you are still finishing up the reel! The solution to this one is easy: First, make sure to ease their minds by telling them to &#8220;relax&#8221;... that &#8220;it will only be another twenty minutes or so&#8221; before you are ready to show them anything. Second, after the twenty minutes comes and goes, make sure to update them that you are &#8220;almost done... maybe another 10 or 15 minutes, tops.&#8221; Directors love having their time devalued and their schedules disrespected. In fact, I would encourage you to set the tone for the whole project by doing this from the outset. That way, there won&#8217;t be any surprises about how you are going to handle every approval session throughout the collaboration process. If it&#8217;s one thing directors hate... it&#8217;s surprises!<br />
<br />
<i><b>9. Show Up, Score It, and Move On</b></i><br />
Go ahead and make it clear that anything extra that is asked of you is off the table. <u><i>You do not go the extra mile!</i></u> Once the film is over, move on to something else and forget about this one. Hey... you did your job! Leave the festivals, the junkets, and the promotion up to the PR guys. You fulfilled your contractual obligations and the check cleared, so you certainly don&#8217;t need to be spending your valuable time promoting something that you worked on a year ago. It&#8217;s not your fault the film just now found distribution! In fact, adopting an &#8220;as little as possible&#8221; attitude will get you farther down the path of career destruction than anything. Keep on taking the easy way out and you&#8217;ll be back living in your parents' spare bedroom in a matter of weeks. Mmmm... Mama&#8217;s home cookin&#8217;!!!<br />
<br />
<i><b>10. Finish "Weak"</b></i><br />
After years of planning, writing, re-writing, casting, scouting, shooting, editing, test-screening, and promoting, the <b><i>last</i></b> thing a director and producer want from you is a nice note or a gift letting them know how much you appreciate them and the opportunity they gave to you. Worse than that? A CD of the musical score. Oh Em Gee! I mean, how thoughtless could you be? Don&#8217;t you know that never calling them again until you see on IMDb that they are making another movie is what they really really want from you? Can't you just please leave them alone? It&#8217;s not &#8220;Show Friends&#8221;, it&#8217;s &#8220;Show Business!&#8221; Geez!!!! Get it through your big dumb head!!!!!!!!</div>

</div><span style="font-size: small;">It's a no-brainer that it's easier to collaborate with previous clients than it is with new ones.<br />
</span><br />
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span><br />
</div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8226; Communication flows freer and easier.</span></span><br />
</div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8226; Trust is already developed.</span></span><br />
</div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8226; Familiarity enables shortcuts in explaining ideas.</span></span><br />
</div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8226; Practicalities such as file transfer and online collaboration tools have already been explored. </span></span><br />
</div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></span><br />
</div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Each party just knows from experience how the system works.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">So when a new client comes along it can be a little jolt to that comfortable system. Starting from scratch in a new business relationship can be daunting.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">So, why bother working with new clients when it's so much easier just to stick with what you know?</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Well, for one thing, we should all be so lucky! Sometimes there are quiet patches, sometimes previous clients just don't have the work for us. And that's the time when you're grateful that your word-of-mouth marketing from these previous clients is just so damn good that the phone is ringing off of the hook with new offers. ;-)</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">What I most like about working with new clients is that it can be a real wake-up call to get you out of your comfort zone, get your brain working in different modes in response to a new director's style, way of thinking and communicating.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Follow a few simple rules to make this new relationship start smoothly, and it should continue long into both your futures.<b>&nbsp;</b></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Talk, talk, then talk some more.</b> For the initial meeting, and maybe the one after that, I like to free up my schedule afterwards just in case it runs long. In fact, I hope it runs long, so that we can get into the interesting discussions that make it easier to build the foundations for future collaborations.<b>&nbsp;</b></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Ask questions.</b> What is this new director all about? What films, television, theatre, books, stories, themes do they like? What don't they like? Who do they admire in the business? What are their goals for the film? And for their next project?</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">And their ideal, future career plans? Seriously, clients love to talk about this, and by involving yourself in this emotive topic, empathizing with their excitement or trepidation, providing potential solutions to any issues they flag up, you may indeed entwine yourself into that future vision!</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Time spent talking about these subjects isn't a luxury, it's a necessity. <i>It's essential.</i>&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">You need to know who your director is, what presses their buttons, flicks their switches, gets them fired up and really ticks them off. Then you'll have a much better chance of writing the music they need.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Other things to discuss:<b>&nbsp;</b></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>1. Be clear on each party's role.</b> You're the composer (or sound designer, foley artist etc); he's the director (or post-production supervisor or producer etc). You may collaborate and discuss ideas with anyone else on the team, but ultimately you take the final decisions from him or her alone. No exceptions.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Don't ever accept decision by committee. Can't stress this enough, people! It inevitably ends up with brain-ache and hair loss.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Conversely, if your role is composer, you write the music. That's what you're hired for. It's not the director's job to say, <i>"and here I'd like to go into Eminor with a natural 7th, a BPM of 160 with the melody on the nose-flute. And more cowbell."</i>&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">If that's what he really wants, he sounds like he's already got the smarts to do it himself. He's after an arranger/orchestra/ghostwriter, not a composer. If that's not what you signed up for, now's the time to make that known.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Although, I think it's a given that one can always use more cowbell.<b>&nbsp;</b></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>2. Ensure a clear goal that both parties agree on.</b> Make sure it's realistic. Agree preliminary, intermediate and final draft delivery dates. Agree also how many revisions is practical and realistic within time frame and budget.<b>&nbsp;</b></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>3. Be easy to work with.</b> Be nice! Smile, listen, empathise, respond, understand. Being professional, hitting deadlines is expected; but being easy to work with means that you're one less ego for the director to deal with. He's dealt with many before he's got to your part of the process. Go against the grain and be a breath of fresh air for him or her.<b>&nbsp;</b></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>4. Go above and beyond the call of duty.</b> Provide as much value as you can. Be better than the next guy. ;-)<b>&nbsp;</b></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>5. Emphasize your objectivity</b> towards your craft and product. That you understand that your music or sound is raw material for the ultimate final vision of the film. As such you will be open to constructive criticism, changes of direction, etc.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">I cannot stress this enough. The director must be made to understand that the first draft is just that, and it certainly isn't written in stone, and if they don't like it<i> you can and will change it.</i>&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">This first draft is a more concrete point of reference, a point of reflection which both parties can talk about in 'real' terms, and is necessary for the next draft to be the best it can be, even if it's in a completely different style.<b>&nbsp;</b></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>6. Talk about </b><b>how best you work</b>, your strategies to get the best from your time when composing etc. Hopefully this will illustrate that if you're the kind of chap who doesn't enjoy writing music with someone watching over your shoulder, they won't insist on doing just that.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">If you're a scheduling, organizational freak like me, and say so, they won't start a habit of 'popping by' unannounced. However, if you're keeping the lines of communication open, they really shouldn't ever feel the need.<b>&nbsp;</b></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>7. B</b><b>e as available as you possibly can be to lines of communication </b>- phone, email, in-person meetings... </span><span style="font-size: small;">within reason. Talking on the phone ain't gonna get that score written, which is ultimately what you've been hired for. However, </span><span style="font-size: small;">communication is key to collaboration. Make sure they feel absolutely free to contact you about any ideas or thoughts or questions that will impact on the direction of the music and sound, and b</span><span style="font-size: small;">e communicative in return. Reply to emails and voicemail regularly.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">---</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">I find that when I follow this pattern from the very start of the relationship, and if the client is successful enough, I'm pretty much guaranteed repeat business should I choose to take up the opportunity.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Think of it from the director's point of view: he's built this fantastic rapport and trust with you through all this communication, and clearly you're easy to collaborate with, take direction easily, are very responsive (and obviously produce great results!). Why would they want to go to all the hassle of starting from scratch again with a new composer, eh?</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Whilst scribbling down these ideas I'm sure I've missed a whole bunch of other points that make the process of working with a new client easier. If you've noticed any glaring holes, do let us know in the COMMENTS below!</span></span><br />

<div id='summary3509009467987602524'><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SuNJEci52BI/AAAAAAAAAxI/jke90HcOvWI/s1600-h/brockmann-scoremixer.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SuNJEci52BI/AAAAAAAAAxI/jke90HcOvWI/s320/brockmann-scoremixer.png" /></a><br />
</div>I started out by scratching my head a bit, considering the topic of Collaboration. After all, there's often only one engineer in the room, particularly in composer's personal studio. But then, I figured, even in that case I'm certainly not working alone or in a vacuum. It's almost impossible not to work with other people in this business, and who would want to? Here are some ways in which a score mixer collaborates with others.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;The Scoring Stage</span><br />
When called on to work in a commercial studio or scoring stage I almost always work as a member of a team. As an independent free-lancer, I am hired by the composer, and am the designated "team leader"; I'm in charge of the composer's technical needs and interfacing with the staff of the studio.<br />
<br />
I couldn't do it without helpers, almost always provided by the stage or studio: setup personnel, an assistant engineer, most likely a recordist/Pro Tools operator. When those guys have their act together, it can really help the session go "like butter", and a smooth technical experience in the studio is essential to success for the date. Everything has to be planned out in advance, set up perfectly, tested before the downbeat, and there can be no delays for technical problems. The best studios and stages earn their reputation for excellence by providing staff personnel who are uncompromising experts at this.<br />
<br />
I also have my "horror story" list of studios where this kind of thing didn't happen, where not to go back. In the ideal world of projects with nice big budgets, we would always record at top-notch places like Capitol or the studio stages, but that's not always the case. A part of what I have to offer in helping composers record is my career-long experience in the various studios around LA, what they can do technically and, most importantly, whether their staff "gets it" and understands the world of scoring. Not all of them do. A few years back, on a low-budget film project, we booked a large room over in Burbank for a day of string recording. Because of various delays in setup, we got started almost an hour late. After an extremely tense day of recording, I expressed my disappointment to the manager, who replied, "We've been working with Joe Walsh recently &#8212; he books 10 a.m., usually shows up at noon, and we like it that way!" (If you want to know which studio, just call me.)<br />
<br />
Unless it's a "live mix" gig (see my <a href="2009/08/live-mix-recording-two-television.html">SCO article</a> about live recording), most projects go back to the composer's private digs or mine for mixing, and of course they started there as well with rough mixes, MIDI work, file prep, conversion, etc. That's when the job for me may be a solitary one in the engineer department. But there are sometimes opportunities for engineer collaboration there as well, as was illustrated recently when I worked on an exciting Disney action-adventure score with composer Greg Edmonson.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Teamwork, Tag-team, and Sending a Sub</span><br />
It's incredible how much work a composer has to do in a short amount of time, to meet a deadline on a film score. Burning the candle at both ends is old hat &#8212; how about both ends, the middle, several sides...? I take it as my responsibility to be a "safety net" for the composer, and make sure nothing gets missed in all the myriad of technical details that have to be attended to, even (especially) when the composer is sleep-deprived and desperately trying to get it all done on time.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I consider the responsible thing to do is to ask someone to help out. If the composer needs an engineer to work both day and night, and I can recommend and train someone to continue with what we're working on, I may make the suggestion to call in a "fresh horse". Don't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to working hard, but I think the ultimate goal should be for the success of the project (not just the maximum number of hours on my clock).<br />
<br />
That situation didn't come up on this particular project, but a couple of things did that were similar: after several days of work mixes and preparation, Greg and I went into a commercial studio to record strings and brass. In his personal studio, he uses Logic, but Pro Tools is almost always used in public studios, so there is file preparation and conversion needed, from one software to the other and back again, which takes time. The composer didn't want to wait, the following morning, for tracks to be consolidated and exported from Pro Tools before he could bring them into Logic and start editing them to match the MIDI parts, because of the looming mix delivery deadline.<br />
<br />
So I called on my old friend and expert engineer David Appelt. When we finished with strings, he met us at the studio and took away a hard drive copy to another Pro Tools system (mine) and exported string submixes from all 40 cues. By the time we were done with the evening brass date, he came back over and delivered the files. Teamwork!<br />
<br />
There are other situations that require sending a good sub. An old buddy, John the studio guitarist, once told me a definition of the free-lancer's life: "The good news is, I have three gigs this week; the bad news is, they are all Tuesday morning at 10 o'clock!" We all work for more than one client, and sometimes there is a schedule conflict. And, on rare occasions one must call in sick, which happened on this job. I haven't had anything worse than the sniffles for probably five years or more, but got a little slammed during the mixing process; it was great to have David available to come in and sub a couple of days without missing a beat.<br />
<br />
If I have to send a sub, I would never send him in "cold"; I always have a detailed conversation with the other engineer to bring him up to speed on all the technical details he will need to know &#8212; software, mixing board, outboard gear, patching, and any personal preferences the composer might take for granted. I'm not such a control freak that I would totally set things up in advance or micro-manage everything. I believe a good experienced engineer works best with his brain fully engaged, and if he has to figure out one or two things or make some setup decisions himself, this can be helpful.<br />
<br />
What makes someone a good sub? Two things, plain and sample: one, he has to be reliable, technically and business-wise, that is, he shows up on time and knows how to do the job right. And, second, he doesn't try to schmooze the client or steal the gig. This isn't the time to yak about your website or latest big feature. You'd be surprised how some don't get that part. It's a small town; ethics and relationships matter.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Collaborating with the Composer</span><br />
Last but not least, as a mixer I develop a good collaborative relationship with the man or woman who brought me there, the composer.<br />
<br />
Because of the time-intensive nature of what we do, a mixer may well be the one professional that has more "face time" with the composer than anyone else on the job, be they studio musicians, orchestrators, whatever. It's a situation that requires a lot of trust, confidentiality, and discretion. Often a discussion will come up that is more than just whether the guitar or oboe is loud enough &#8212; "Do you think this works? Which do you like better? Does that instrument sound in tune?" and so forth.<br />
<br />
I have a pretty good background as a musician, with experience in classical, jazz, and pop. I have never played or composed professionally, and have no ambition to do so; I'm truly happy in a supportive role. But as a composer gets to know me, he or she often will find it useful to have a musician to bounce performance questions, production ideas, and other things off of. I would never impose myself when unwanted, or argue. With some clients it's strictly about the technical business at hand, and I'm fine with that. But I come to work with all my experience and talents available, and feel most useful when I can contribute whatever is necessary to making the project as good as possible.<br />
<br />
That's what it's all about &#8212; when it ends up great everyone shines, and maybe we even get to do it again!<br />

It's up to you. No additional constraints, except the ones you choose to put on yourself. But you really have to find someone who will be honest with you about what does and doesn't work for them.</div><div>My point in suggesting this exercise is to explore what resonates with the people around you, and to see if that stuff is the same stuff, related stuff, or <i>completely different</i> stuff than what resonates with you. Equally important, it's about gaining some free experience in trying to translate someone else's feedback into meaningful, successful revisions.</div><div>Interpreting someone's comments&#8212;figuring out what they're trying to tell us in this incredibly subjective, incredibly difficult-to-quantify realm, is a crucial skill for us all to develop.</div><div>It's always fascinating (at least to me) when I knock out a cue, just relying on the craft to get the stupid thing done, and then that cue becomes a big hit with The Powers That Be. You do this thing long enough, and it's gonna happen. You'll turn in some work that you feel is sort of uninspired and routine, and magic happens. The client <i>loves</i> it. It becomes the blueprint for the rest of the project&#8230; and you're stuck with this thing that, to you, is nothing special.<br /></div><div>Or maybe the converse happens: you really dig a particular cue&#8212;you'd bet the farm that this one's gonna be a Big Winner. And then&#8230; nothing. Or worse, the client feels you're not even in the ballpark of what they were expecting. How to make the requisite changes?

Maybe it'll be the roaring success you expect it to be. Maybe, if you really press for (and correctly interpret) an honest evaluation, you'll find unexpected areas in which you can improve and grow. At the very least, it's a good excuse to write a kick-ass demo cue in a style that's near and dear to your heart. And that's never a bad thing.</div><div>BTW, if you'd like your fellow SCOREcasters to offer up their opinions, just include a link and let us know. We'll be happy to give you the unvarnished truth. Which might require a little less translating than what you'll get from your goldfish. :-)<br /></div><div>Can't wait to hear what you come up with. I'll do one of these as well. I'll run it by a few pairs of trusted ears and let you know the good, the bad and the ugly. Thinking about it now, I'm a little nervous to get started.

But I do think it's important for us all to be aware of them, and to give some head space to how we plan to answer the challenges they present. And it feels better knowing we're all running into these same strange and inscrutable aspects of the biz, right?</div><div><div><b>Paradox #1:</b> Filmmakers hire you for your uniqueness, but they're often terrified of anything new. As much as you may <i>think</i> you're coming on board as a collaborator, one of your first jobs is going to have to be&#8230; finding out exactly what your job <i>is</i>. In some cases your title might well be "Re-inventor of the Wheel."</div><div>I have some experience on this one. I signed up for one particular independent feature thinking the filmmakers wanted my musical opinion&#8212;raring to go, with strong ideas firmly in place for how best to tackle the material. It was a rude awakening when I realized (after a few <i>veeeerry</i> tense playback sessions) they simply wanted a score that sounded like every other score in the genre.</div><div>It wasn't a case of "temp love"&#8212;I'll give 'em that. They were happy to let go of their temp track. What they wanted in its place, though, was straight down the middle of the road. Any time I tried an unusual instrumental combination, or a more oblique approach to the material, I was smacked down. Needless to say, you won't be hearing the finished product on any of my demos.</div><div>My advice here, as I stated above, is find out as soon as possible what role you're going to be allowed to play. If you have latitude, great. Use it. Stretch yourself; take chances. You won't always have the opportunity on future gigs. On the other hand, if the filmmakers want you simply because you're the guy with those sample libraries, it's up to you to decide how to proceed.</div><div>Richard Bellis puts it this way: "Always know what you're getting out of the gig." If it's not creatively stimulating, there needs to be something&#8212;a connection, a paycheck, or <i>something</i>&#8212;that you can take away from the experience.</div><div><b>Paradox #2:</b> To become successful at the highest level, you must differentiate yourself&#8212;develop your own compositional "voice." But the more successful you are, the easier it is to be trapped into merely repeating what you've done before. We can sit around and name a long list of composers&#8212;often big-name people&#8212;whose output sounds suspiciously similar from picture to picture. Part of that comes from external pressures: a composer is hired because a filmmaker loves his previous work, and wants <i>that</i> sound for <i>this</i> new picture. Lather, rinse, repeat enough times and you're in a dangerous ground for self-cannibalization.</div><div>And it's seductively <i>easy</i>: at least one Big Name Guy is known, on his sketches, simply to list a cue from one of his previous films, then mark different chord changes over the bar lines to vary it up. <i>Fail</i>.</div><div>Elmer Bernstein, on the other hand, used to refer to his career as progressing in stages: he'd score a big successful Bible Epic/Western/Hip Comedy, then he'd inevitably be pigeonholed for a while as Bible Epic/Western/Hip Comedy Guy. When that genre fell out of fashion, or when he felt he was stagnating, he went through a period of time when he just didn't work. Rather than get stuck, he'd simply detach, re-invent, and break out somewhere new in a couple of years.</div><div>Look up a few prolific composers on IMDb and you'll see the same thing: most of them periodically and deliberately step outside the realm in which they're best known, to tackle material that might be smaller-budget but which allows them to broaden their potential appeal.</div><div>It's creatively fulfilling, and in the long run it's smart business.</div><div><b>Paradox #3:</b> The bigger the project, the more pressure you'll be under to deliver something amazing, on time, and on budget. But you'll probably also face greater pressure, from more stakeholders, on a tighter time schedule, managing a larger team.</div><div>There's no way around this one these days. Big projects have many stakeholders, and represent a significant gamble on the part of the funders. They will want to have some input on your contributions, and managing those multiple inputs (expect them to be contradictory!) is yet another aspect of the career in which you must become an expert. Don't think that if you're sufficiently brilliant, your music will silence all objections. It won't happen.</div><div>I've had this dream from time to time&#8230; I walk in the door and all the filmmakers are arguing over what the music should be for a scene. Like an oracle, I silently walk to the computer and press PLAY. The raw genius of the music that results causes my collaborators to weep tears of joy and hug one another in creative solidarity.</div><div>And then I wake up.</div><div><b>Paradox #4:</b> The sound tools (synths, sample libraries, etc.) that allow you to get in the door and play with the big boys are the same ones that will ultimately limit your artistic growth and relevance.</div><div>The stuff, in other words, that makes you sound like everyone else (and thus, able to compete for gigs)&#8230; <i>makes you sound like everyone else </i>(preventing you from distinguishing yourself as a uniquely desirable collaborator). Short-term boost; long-term anchor. This one seems to work itself out a little more readily that some of the others&#8212;as you grow and progress, you'll naturally want to step away from the same tired old stock samples that everyone uses. It's the very definition of refining your voice. But starting out, it's a tough thing to do&#8230; especially when you've just spent money you didn't have for that copy of Omnisphere or Symphobia or (insert flavor-of-the-month sample library here).</div><div><b>Paradox #5</b>: The more deeply you become involved in the business of collaboration, the harder it is to maintain a love of film music. This one may be controversial, but it's something I've heard from enough people that I want to include it here.</div><div>It happens, I think, because you're now personally invested in the process. You have a pig's-eye view of how the sausage is made, so to speak. The ability to lose yourself in a story when you sit in the theater, in front of the television, or wherever, is a delicate thing. Living with all those thoughts in your mind about "I'll bet they temped this with <i>Gladiator</i>" gives the picture&#8212;and its score&#8212;even less of a chance to capture your imagination.</div><div>My advice here is simple: struggle against this. Discipline your mind to operate in two modes: consumer and professional. You won't always succeed, but you will stay more closely in touch with that highly-motivated, wide-eyed kid you used to be. That, to me, is a good thing. It can give you the motivation you need to get through the all-nighters.</div><div><b>Paradox #6:</b> Some of the most important collaborative work you will ever do in your career will have nothing to do with music. Simple as that. Your connections with people&#8212;and I mean that word "connections" in its non-schmoozy sense&#8212;will keep you going in all the other aspects of your life that <i>allow</i> you to do the thing we're always talking about here. I could write more, but you get it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Thoughts?</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div></div>

</div>This last weekend, a good friend of mine from northern California stayed with us for three days as he finished business here in LA on a little festival film that I scored for him earlier this year. It dawned on me this weekend &#8212; as we sat around, drinking endless amounts of CocaCola Slurpees, and talking movies &#8212; just how much fun it is to collaborate with someone you also have a solid friendship with. Many great conversations were had, but one sticks out the most, and is an interesting discussion starter here:<br />
<br />
<i><b>If we didn't have our projects in common with  our directors, would we still be friends?</b></i><br />
<br />
As for me and my friend Scott, we really couldn't answer that question. Who knows? The fact is that we <u><i>do</i></u> have film in common, so the point is sort of moot. But that got me thinking about us as collaborators. What makes it work?<br />
<br />
Scoring "Bad Faith" for Scott was a near perfect experience. In fact my last three or four films have been some pretty awesome times. But I've also been a part of filmmaking teams when the process was an exercise in utter agony. Sometimes the shoe just isn't the right fit, and even though you may make it through the storm this time as a team, it is likely that the next go'round will involve a  different group of storm-chasers.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/St31dbORFeI/AAAAAAAAAOQ/qLm6OCxE0uE/s1600-h/Dossier_Indy_45.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="189" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/St31dbORFeI/AAAAAAAAAOQ/qLm6OCxE0uE/s320/Dossier_Indy_45.jpg" width="252" /></a>All of this reminiscing leads me to examine some of the collaborations that have proven successful throughout the history of film, and even a few that have sparked up as of late. <i>Hitchcock</i> and <i>Herrmann</i>. <i>Burton</i> and <i>Elfman</i>. The <i>Coens</i> and <i>Burwell</i>. <i>Singer</i> and <i>Ottman</i>. <i>Spielberg</i> and <i>Williams</i>. <i>Lucas</i> and <i>Williams</i>. <b><i>Anybody</i></b> and <i>Williams</i>??<br />
<br />
You could say that Hitchcock and Herrmann were cut from the same cloth. It might be said that Spielberg and Williams are visionary icons that found each other at just the right time and place, and a perfect partnership was forged. Bryan Singer and John Ottman met in film school and have been creative partners ever since, save for one film where schedules conflicted.<br />
<br />
Not just in the film industry, however, great collaboration is a cross-compatible phenomenon. <i>Mick Jagger</i> and <i>Keith Richards</i>. <i>Larry Page </i>and<i> Sergey Brin. Coco Chanel</i> and <i>Pierre Wertheimer</i>. <i>Bill Hewlitt</i> and <i>David Packard</i>. <i>The Beatles</i> and <i>George Martin</i>. <i>Will</i> and <i>Mike</i> on Big Brother 2. :o)<br />
<br />
What is it that really makes a collaboration great? Do you need certain non-negotiable variables to be in place in order that an incredible and perfect working relationship can occur, or do they just naturally happen as the Universe sees fit? Is a little bit of tension important, or is an environment free of friction and conflict the best way to work?<br />
<br />
<b>1. When you really put some thought into it, what have been the variables to your own successful collaborations?</b><br />
<br />
<b>2. And... conversely, what things will <u><i>kill</i></u> a potentially great collaboration? </b><br />

<div id='summary4887851256580544131'><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/StzqBx9xjLI/AAAAAAAAAN4/85fzPxPg6PU/s1600-h/cooke-ladder.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/StzqBx9xjLI/AAAAAAAAAN4/85fzPxPg6PU/s320/cooke-ladder.png" /></a><br />
</div>I'm about to embark on an experiment of sorts, and I'd like to share my progress with you as I go. We all know how tough it can be sometimes to make enough money from composing - in particular when starting off.  Some of us have a part time job while starting off, some have a full time job - others have no side jobs - just composing.<br />
<br />
So... how can we make more money from our music, even after it has been used for its original purpose of a film score, etc.? We sometimes forget that the money making process doesn't always have to stop there - we can keep licensing our music (depending on the original license we signed with the director/creator) after the original project. It's not all about the money, but let's not fool ourselves - we all need money to survive, and the more the merrier. :-)<br />
<br />
I currently sell some of my music on stock music libraries and make between $200-$350 per month - which is nice pocket money for paying the bills, or  buying whatever.  However, that money is generally only 50% or less, of the net profit that my music makes - the websites I sell on can take from 50% - 75% of the money my music earns, which can often be quite disheartening.<br />
<br />
Therefore, I looked into ways to make 100% profit on selling my music - then it hit me - I sell a collection of about 12 piano tracks on a website about 4 or 5 times a month, and it sells for $100 a pop (of which I earn 50%).  So...if I could sell a CD for $100, why not sell it on my own website for $100 for licensing purposes or $20 for personal listening, and earn all of the profit? So I contacted some CD duplication companies to see how much it would cost to get 50 CDs created, and started looking at the sums:<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Expenditure:</span><br />
<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Crystal_Clear_app_kspread.png" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Crystal_Clear_app_kspread.png" style="cursor: pointer; float: right; height: 128px; margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; width: 128px;" /></a>50 CDs = $283 (CDs include colour artwork printed on CD, jewelcases, album cover and back)<br />
Delivery = $24<br />
__________<br />
Total =  $307<br />
<br />
If we then take a look at the total possible income, the money starts to add up nicely.  Lets say I sell 30 CDs for personal listening (I'm sure I could find enough friends and family to buy them! LOL) and then 20 CDs for licensing purposes.<br />
<br />
30 x $20 = $600<br />
20 x $100 = $2000<br />
_____________<br />
Net Total = $2600<br />
______________________________<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Gross Total Possible Income</span>= <span style="font-style: italic;">$2293</span><br />
_____________________________<br />
<br />
OK - so the above sums <span style="font-style: italic;">may </span>be wishful thinking, but it certainly looks like it could be a profitable venture, so why not try? My CDs are being made this week and should be ready in a few days time.  I'll share my progress with you as I go - I think it will be a worthwhile experiment.<br />
<br />
The next questions is - how do I sell them/market them? That's where things get interesting... I want to make 100% of the profit so I won't be using services such as <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/">CD Baby</a> to sell my CDs for me - at least for now. I'll be trying a few different marketing ideas and I'll let you know which work, and which don't.<br />
<br />
In Part 2 of this article (coming soon), I'll show you how to license music on your website, rather than relying on other sites to do it for you.<br />
<br />
Have <span style="font-style: italic;">you </span>looked into CD Duplication services in your area, and have you tried selling CDs of your music? How do they stack up against services like <a href="http://www.discmakers.com/">DiscMakers</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oasiscd.com%2F&amp;ei=7ercSoqQC4eKswPswqCsDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHywmE0v-Idhc0i-3fI5okm7jkmRA&amp;sig2=NgunpYCKI2q-slGmOw_JOQ">Oasis</a>?

<div id='summary7242123648043087709'><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/Stzrwx9ZP6I/AAAAAAAAAOA/r8wjGnwsbcI/s1600-h/sanders-provocation.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/Stzrwx9ZP6I/AAAAAAAAAOA/r8wjGnwsbcI/s320/sanders-provocation.png" /></a><br />
</div>Today, on Weekend Provocation, <b>I am calling out </b><b><a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000233/" rel="imdb" title="Quentin Tarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a></b>. Simple as that.<br />
<br />
I've wanted to write this ever since I read the following quotation from QT (at Cannes in May 2008): <br />
<br />
<blockquote><blockquote>&#8220;I have one of the best soundtrack collections in America. I just don&#8217;t trust any composer to do it. The idea of paying this guy and showing him your movie at the end&#8212;Who the f*** is this guy coming in here and throwing his s*** over my movie. What if I don&#8217;t like it? And the guy&#8217;s already been paid!&#8221; </blockquote></blockquote><br />
QT has every right to make his pictures the way he wants. It's his prerogative as the director. No argument. And his pastiche-y style of soundtrack assembly matches his directorial style, which is equally heavy on extra-textual reference and homage. I get it.<br />
<br />
But for him to make this statement&#8212;which was delivered in a Cannes Cinema Master Class, so it pretty clearly comes off not just as one man's advice but as a universal recommendation&#8212;brings me to a few objections:<br />
<br />
First, let's talk business. QT mentions this whole "paying-in-advance" thing twice in his quotation, so his money's on his mind. But here's the thing: If a set designer builds a set the director doesn't like, he's fired&#8212;but he gets paid for the work he's already done. If a writer turns in a draft of a screenplay that subsequently gets dumped, the filmmakers hire someone else&#8212;but the writer gets paid for the work he's already done. If an actor isn't delivering the performance the director wants, he's fired&#8212;but he's paid for the work he's already done. Composers should be no different.<br />
<br />
If you "don't like it&#8212;and the guy's already been paid!" then you fire him and find someone else. Just like you'd do with any other member of your creative team.<br />
<br />
It's part of the collaborative process, and part of the director's responsibility and talent, to assemble a team around his vision. Music is an intensely personal aspect of filmmaking (and particularly so for QT), and I can imagine how difficult it must be for someone to try to match the nuanced, specific musical ideas that QT brings to his storytelling. Probably impossible&#8212;QT is probably saving everyone a lot of heartache by assembling his scores the way he does.<br />
<br />
But for him to imply that it's <i>outrageous</i> that a composer be paid for his time (regardless of whether his score is approved yet or not&#8212;oh, the injustice!) also implies that most composers are somehow incompetent. To paraphrase QT (fairly, I think), it's a waste of a filmmaker's time trying to work with an entire <i>category</i> of people who are only going to screw up the picture. That borders on the insulting.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which&#8230;<br />
I know QT often tends to choose his words for their shock value. But the context of this quotation goes beyond that: he's at Cannes, speaking primarily with other beginning filmmakers. There's a certain "in-group" implication here&#8212;that somehow composers aren't to be considered as valid creative collaborators. While it's none of my business to criticize how QT himself chooses to make a film, I think it is my business to stick up for the idea that composers are, in fact, a valid part of the creative process.<br />
<br />
To make QT's technique the norm&#8212;i.e., for every director to assemble his score from bits and pieces of all the music that's come before&#8212;brings the advancement of film scoring as a technology, as a field of endeavor, and (if you believe it to be so) as an <i>art</i>, to a grinding halt. Something that's not considered here is the idea that a composer might bring something new to the table, something that enhances the director's vision for the story in ways the director might not have ever considered. Might, in fact, make it even better.<br />
<br />
QT's technique precludes that possibility entirely, containing the creative intersection between picture and music entirely within the mind of the director. For QT, as I've said, that seems to work just fine. In the long run, though, for it to become standard practice diminishes filmmaking.<br />
<br />
One qualification here: I wasn't at the master class, and the press tends to take quotations like this out of context. They're looking for headlines. Nevertheless, I researched this one pretty carefully, and I haven't been able to find a single instance in which QT comes back and clarifies his comments. If QT is on the record as saying "this is just how I prefer to do it&#8230; it's only intended to apply to me&#8230; it's my opinion, and I encourage you to try to find someone with whom you <i>can</i> collaborate on original score," then my objections are based on a mis-reading of the context (except for the one about being paid for work completed, which stands regardless). QT needs to go on the record and make that clarification. Otherwise, he's telling you, me and everyone else in our field that our jobs shouldn't exist&#8230; that needle-drops chosen by the director are, for both financial and artistic purposes, superior to our considered efforts.<br />
<br />
And for that I have to call him out.<br />
<br />
You have opinions on this. Let's hear 'em.<br />

<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: arial;">For this month&#8217;s column regarding collaborations, I was thinking about all of this great technology these days, the Internet, and how people have - now more than ever - the ability to collaborate at many levels and from any location in the world.</span><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: arial;">Songwriting, Arranging, and Scoring can now have many different authors if you so desire.</span><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: arial;">We have the ability to leverage the talents of session players, arrangers, musicians, producers, et cetera to help create great sounding music.</span><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: arial;">At first you might not embrace this, especially if you don&#8217;t want to split credits, publishing, and royalties. So lets assume for this article we are beyond that and you need or want to collaborate, either in the same location or in another state or country.</span><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
<span style="font-family: arial;">Let's look at some workflows that you can use to collaborate.</span><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />

</div><span style="font-family: arial,serif;"><b></b></span><br />
<div class="MsoNormal"><br />
<b><u><span style="font-family: arial;">Delivery methods:</span><span style="font-family: arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></u></b><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: arial,serif;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>   </b></span></span><br />
</div><span style="font-family: arial,serif;"><b></b></span><br />

</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span style="font-family: arial,serif;"><b><span style="font-weight: normal;">DVD&#8217;s</span></b></span><br />
<br />
<br />
</div><span style="font-family: arial,serif;"><b></b></span><br />
<div class="MsoNormal"><b><u><span style="font-family: arial;">Audio Files: </span><span style="font-family: arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></u></b><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: arial;">This is probably one of the most common ways of transferring your sessions. Of course if your collaboration partner is using the same DAW software, this makes it very easy. You can use one of the delivery methods mentioned above and send your whole project including audio files. If you are not using the same software, there are a few other ways: OMF and AAF, which I will talk about more in detail later.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: arial;">A simple way when dealing with audio files or even MIDI tracks with VI&#8217;s is to print all of your VI&#8217;s to audio tracks and then make continuous regions of the audio files. Using this method allows you to just drop all of the audio files at bar 1 of your new sequence and all of the files are in sync. You or your collaborator can add you&#8217;re new parts; make your parts one long continuous audio file or region, and you&#8217;re set to go back to your partner. (Check on the terminology in your DAW regarding the functionality of making continuous regions. Terms like <i>bounce</i>, <i>bounce regions,</i> <i>consolidate</i> <i>region</i>, etc.</span><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
<b><u><span style="font-family: arial;">Sheet Music- Notation Programs:</span><span style="font-family: arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></u></b><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: arial;">This is pretty self-explanatory and is a bit old-school but this is a ways if you need to have specific parts written or orchestrated. More often you will probably use MIDI files. If you use a music notation program you can write in those programs and either send the program files if you share the same program, or send midi files of the new parts that you can import into your notation program.</span><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
<b><u><span style="font-family: arial;">Standard MIDI Files: </span><span style="font-family: arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></u></b><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: arial;">This file format has been around for a while and is a very easy and small format to email around. You can export all of your MIDI tracks and send to your collaboration partner. The down side is that most people don&#8217;t have all of the same MIDI modules or Virtual Instruments or sample libraries. So while this method is easy to get the raw data to someone, for them to actually hear it the way you meant it to sound is tough. You can in addition send a stereo mix audio file or MP3 to accompany the MIDI file so they can here what you have done. Open the MIDI file, simply play along recording your new parts, save and email back to your partner.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: arial;">I have actually used this method to a piano part for a CD track. I received the midi file and MP3 via email, loaded both files, played the piano part as midi, and sent back. They loaded the new tracks and played back my MIDI parts using Synthogy&#8217;s</span><span style="font-family: arial;">  </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Ivory Piano VI . Very Cool!</span><b><u><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></u></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u><span style="font-family: arial;">Real-Time Internet Collaboration Services:</span><span style="font-family: arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></u></b><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: arial;">These new web sites and services have recently been popping up in the recent years and give you the ability to play in real-time with others over the Internet while recording. Other sites allow you to have musicians like the drummer from Oingo Boingo or Dean Ogden for that matter, play parts on your session. </span><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
<span style="font-family: arial;">Check out these sites:</span><br />

</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: arial,serif; font-weight: bold;">ISDN:</span><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: arial;">This is used primarily by voice over talent, but also large studios to stream real time audio over the phone lines. ISDN are digital phones lines that can be used for both voice and data. </span><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: arial;">These are special lines that you need to have special ordered from your local phone company, and they are not cheap. Secondly, you need to have and ISDN CODEC. This is the box that interfaces with your audio gear, then compresses the audio over the phone line back into another CODEC at the receiving studio and out to the mixing board or recorder.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: arial;">These boxes are in the multi thousand-dollar range. But if your living is doing voice over&#8217;s from your home like voice over star Joe Cipriano, then break out the credit card.</span><b><u><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></u></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u><span style="font-family: arial;">OMF/AAF:</span><span style="font-family: arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></u></b><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: arial;">OMF (Open Media Framework, also known as OMFI&#8212;Open Media Framework Interchange)</span><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: arial;">The OMF file format is typically used to exchange data with Digidesign Pro Tools software. The OMF format only supports the exchange of audio data (audio media and the use of this audio media in a project)&#8212;MIDI and automation data is ignored when using the export functions. (Pro Tools LE and HD need the Optional DigiTranslator software (~$500) to use OMF or AAF)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: arial;">AAF is the Advanced Authoring Format and was developed by the advanced media workflow association to expand on the OMF standard.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: arial;">All of the Major DAW&#8217;s support OMF and most support AFF.</span><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: arial;">Both of the formats allow your DAW or NLE video software to exchange and share session information, which includes audio and video data.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: arial;">These files are platform independent and include meta data, along with the audio and video data, and were developed primarily to be sent from video post-production facilities. Audio could then be edited and cleaned up, mixed and sent back to the video house with the final video for final lay back. Although you can use these formats for audio-to-audio type scenarios be aware that originally the formats where designed to be more of a one-way type workflow not back and forth.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: arial;">The Meta data is very generic in nature. It does not keep any information on plug-ins, or routing of your internal busses. It does not store MIDI tracks, regions and tempo maps. However track automation and fades are supported.</span><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: arial;">So be aware that trying to take your perfect mix in DP and finish it in your buddy&#8217;s Logic DAW is probably not realistic. Sending your session to your friend to record a vocal part, edit and send back is more of a likely scenario, as well as basic tracking.</span><br />
</div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: arial;">Check you DAW&#8217;s documentation for exporting/importing OMF/AAF files. Different options are offered, such as converting 24 bit to 16 bit, exporting names, etc. See below a screen shot of Digital Performer 7&#8217;s export dialog box</span><br />

Yes, highly successful film composers <span style="font-style: italic;">are </span>extraordinary people with great musical ideas &#8211; but they&#8217;re not magicians.  There&#8217;s simply too much for one person to do alone.  They have armies, and not just of studio musicians.<br /><br />Think about it.  When Hans Zimmer lobbies for a scoring project, he&#8217;s not just selling the fact that he can invent cool film music.  Chances are, <span style="font-style: italic;">you </span>can do that.  He&#8217;s selling the strength of his <span style="font-style: italic;">organization </span>&#8211; the ability to get the job done.  Take a look for yourself, at <a href="http://hans-zimmer.com/fr/newsite.php?rub=rcprod">www.hans-zimmer.com</a>.<br /><br />If you want to win, by all means hone your composing skills.  Bootstrap yourself up by taking any gig from which you can learn.  But also, recognize that <span style="font-style: italic;">that&#8217;s not enough</span>, and commit yourself to:  (a) understanding the end-to-end workflow by which you&#8217;ll compose <span style="font-style: italic;">and </span>produce film music on the scale you envision, and (b) building an organization that&#8217;s capable of efficiently executing the process you&#8217;ve defined.  The sooner you start <span style="font-style: italic;">working </span>on this challenge, the better.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yeah, But How?</span><br /><br />You have to be familiar enough with how film music is scored and produced, what all the people involved do, and what the alternatives are, that you&#8217;d be able to describe a workflow at a pretty detailed level.  Try it!  Go all the way from negotiating a scoring contract to the delivery of ready-to-dub audio for your cues, and think about <span style="font-style: italic;">everything </span>that&#8217;s necessary each step along the way.  If you think you&#8217;re not quite up to this yet, hit the books.  Start with something comprehensive, like <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.amazon.com/Track-Guide-Contemporary-Scoring-Second/dp/0415941369/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1255496059&amp;sr=8-1">On The Track</a> by Karlin and Wright.  If you&#8217;re in too much of a hurry for that, study Sonny Kompanek&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Score-Screen-Sequencers-Thoughts-Scoring/dp/0825673089/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1255496152&amp;sr=1-1"><span style="font-style: italic;">From Score To Screen</span></a> to get your thought processes going.  Branch out from there.<br /><br />Recognize that the process that gets you from A to Z is a series of transformations:  from director&#8217;s vision to spotting notes; spotting notes to sketches; sketches to orchestrations; orchestrations to mockups, printed scores, and orchestra design; mockups to click tracks; click tracks and printed scores to recording takes; recording takes to mixdowns; and so on. <span style="font-style: italic;"> Your</span> process may differ in detail from mine, and needs to reflect the type and scale of the film music business you&#8217;re aiming for.<br /><br />Progressing from one transformation to the next, who&#8217;s handing off what, to whom, and for what purpose?  What back-and-forth interactions need to occur?  What information needs to communicated in order to keep everyone on the same page?  What means of communication will be used?  How long should each transformation take?  Where are the bottlenecks in the process?  Where are opportunities to speed things up by adding more people?  What are the approximate tradeoffs between dollars and speed?  How can the answers to these questions be applied when negotiating a scoring contract?  How will you communicate to potential customers that you have a good handle on everything &#8211; and can get the job done?<br /><br />As you think about the above issues, recognize that real scoring projects will have to cope with a certain amount of chaos.  A key source of chaos is the film director, who may not be great at communicating his or her musical vision up front.  If that&#8217;s the case, expect lots of changes and iterations before there is firm agreement on the film music.  Moreover, the <span style="font-style: italic;">timing </span>of each cue is a function of the timing of the picture, which means that if the director decides to make picture changes at the last minute, cues may have to be rewritten.  In the past, the tedium involved in film post-production meant that the picture had to be frozen far in advance of release and directors couldn&#8217;t make such last-minute changes.  But digital technologies have sped up post-production to such a degree that late changes to the picture are now common.  This can be extremely disruptive to the film music effort.  Bottom line:  you have to have thick skin, <span style="font-style: italic;">and </span>your film music process management system must be robust enough to keep everything straight even in the face of disruption.<br /><br />The more you think about the <span style="font-style: italic;">details </span>of how various things get done, the more questions will arise.  Dig deeper until you can answer them.  Talk to people.  Soak up <span style="font-style: italic;">SCOREcast Online</span> through your pores.  Read Deane Ogden&#8217;s lips.  Ask yourself if you still want to be a film composer.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">What Kind of Organization?</span><br /><br />People, and processes.  Dang, that sounds like a <span style="font-style: italic;">company</span>.<br /><br />But if you&#8217;re picturing a conventional company with a nice building somewhere and a bunch of employees on a regular payroll, forget that.  I&#8217;m really talking about a <span style="font-style: italic;">virtual company</span>, which comes together only in a functional sense and for a particular film music project, and disbands when the project has been completed.  Its headquarters may be your living room, and its address may exist only in cyberspace. <span style="font-style: italic;"> You </span>are the principal officer of this virtual company, as well as its creative leader, and the customer contracts with <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span>. From a business standpoint, the customer is a film production venture, which may itself be a virtual company.  From an artistic standpoint, the <span style="font-style: italic;">film director</span> is the individual you must satisfy.<br /><br />On the basis of your talent, your ideas, and your convincing argument that you can reliably deliver, you manage to land a film music contract.  In the process of negotiating that contract, you will have benefitted from knowing in advance who your potential collaborators are and how they will work together.  Ideally, you will even have been in contact with them during the negotiations, describing what needs to be done and to get quotes, time estimates, and availability data in return.  You will have applied this information to develop a rough schedule and budget for the film music, which you could then compare with the money the customer was offering and the deadline being imposed, to convince yourself that you could indeed handle the project with an acceptable level of risk.  Your ability to gather and apply this information quickly from your network of potential collaborators is an integral part of the system you&#8217;ve set up in advance.<br /><br />With contract in hand, you then turn around and marshal the resources needed to get the job done, from the network of mobile, skilled, specialized professionals that you&#8217;ve built.  Each individual you bring in from your network operates as an independent contractor or service provider, and not as your employee.  Before you even started looking for projects, you and each of your network members have already hammered out the details of <span style="font-style: italic;">how </span>you&#8217;ll collaborate when a project materializes &#8211; based on your master plan for how your film music machine operates.  And you&#8217;ve systematically kept your network members informed regarding project opportunities that may be developing, so that nobody&#8217;s surprised.<br /><br />This gives real meaning and purpose to <span style="font-style: italic;">networking</span>.  You&#8217;re no longer networking for some ambiguous reason.  You network to find people who have the skills and services you need and with whom you think you can work.  To each person with whom you connect, you explain what you&#8217;re trying to do.  If you feel the chemistry between you is good and sense that a win-win proposition is at hand, you bring this individual into your network and start working out the methodology of future collaborations.  However, until there is an actual film music project in which you specifically contract for this person&#8217;s services, he or she remains a free agent and can work with anyone else.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">From Where Will the People Come?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">The people you need are all around you</span>.  Fellow composers, orchestrators, copyists, assistants, music editors, orchestra contractors, solo players, conductors, studio operators, recording/mixing engineers, equipment renters, payroll services, logistics people, web developers, entertainment attorneys, agents, etc.  There&#8217;s no shortage of talented people who <span style="font-style: italic;">want </span>to be part of a viable, credible film music enterprise.  They&#8217;re looking for <span style="font-style: italic;">you, the guy or gal with a plan</span>, who needs somebody like them.  And remember &#8211; not everybody wants to be at the helm.  Plenty of people are happy just to earn a living working on something exciting.  They need a good leader and architect, someone they trust can pull it all together.  That&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span>.  Your job, as composer and head of your team, is to <span style="font-style: italic;">create </span>that well-founded trust.  If you&#8217;re good enough and articulate enough, they will follow you.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Where </span>are these willing collaborators?  If you&#8217;re lucky (wise?) enough to live in Los Angeles or another major media production hub, chances are that most of the people you need are practically next-door neighbors.  That can be a significant advantage in terms of time, effort, and money.  If you&#8217;re outside of such a media mecca, don&#8217;t give up &#8211; you&#8217;ll have to make some important choices in formulating your plan.  Think systematically about each type of task, interaction, and communication that will need to occur in the process of scoring and producing your film music.  For each one, decide whether the relevant individuals need to be working in physical proximity;  or, conversely, whether collaboration at a distance is feasible and effective.  As a broad generalization, I think you&#8217;ll find that tasks related to <span style="font-style: italic;">scoring </span>are more amenable to distance collaboration;  in contrast, <span style="font-style: italic;">live production</span> will require people to be in the same place.  Next, for tasks that require having your collaborators together physically, will you aim to use local resources, or will you (and others) travel?  Traveling to another city to record your score isn&#8217;t so unusual.  For example, listen to <span style="font-style: italic;">SCOREcast Podcast No. 6</span>.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Leveraging the Web for All It&#8217;s Worth</span><br /><br />Obviously, the more tasks you can accomplish by remote collaboration, the better, as long as doing so is efficient.  The web can provide the bare-bones medium through which you&#8217;ll communicate.  But you&#8217;ll need either to find and adapt appropriate <span style="font-style: italic;">collaboration tools</span>, or build them yourself (or have someone build them for you).<br /><br />Earlier on, we talked about identifying the interactions that need to occur between collaborators (including, by the way, you and your customer) and defining in detail the protocols for all relevant information exchanges.  As I&#8217;m sure you know, the film music industry has, over the years, evolved various types of documents &#8211; originally on paper &#8211; as a means of mechanizing these communications.  I&#8217;m talking about key documents such as spotting notes, master cue list, cue breakdown notes, instrument breakdowns, recording session plan, track list, and so on.  Understanding these documents, which which people in the business are already familiar, is a great place to start.  In one way or another, you&#8217;ll want to develop the equivalent of these &#8211; but online.<br /><br />There are big advantages to going online, beyond the obvious one of enabling remote collaboration.  You&#8217;re better off using online forms than relying on paper, even if your collaborators are working in the same location &#8211; because it&#8217;s easy for multiple versions of a given document to arise especially when there are a lot of changes (which there will be, for the reasons discussed earlier).  Then, when the schedule is tight and the pressure&#8217;s high, one person&#8217;s copy of a paper-based document will inevitably get out of sync with another&#8217;s, leading to chaos and lost time.  In contrast, you can design a system in which each collaborator accesses the documents he or she needs online (over the web), in a manner such that every individual&#8217;s document view is generated on-the-fly from a single, server-based document database which contains the latest data and can identify what&#8217;s changed.<br /><br />Then, there are other types of exchange which also lend themselves to online interaction, given today&#8217;s digital technologies.  We&#8217;re talking about video clips of film scenes, time code data, sketch scores, MIDI mockups, part scores, conductor&#8217;s score, click tracks, recording templates, and so forth.  Toss in methods such as videoconferencing.<br /><br />The details of how to implement a comprehensive system for gluing a film music team together using web technologies are beyond the scope of the present article.  But it&#8217;s fair to say that none of the things I&#8217;ve mentioned here are pie-in-the-sky dreams.  They&#8217;re well within the reach of a competent web developer using today&#8217;s technologies.  I&#8217;ll even go so far as to say that most &#8211; if not all &#8211; of what you need is available off the shelf.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bottom Line</span><br /><br />If building and commanding your &#8220;machine&#8221; sounds daunting, maybe it is.  But the basic approach isn&#8217;t hard to understand.  First, clarify your vision.  Decide what you&#8217;re aiming for, in terms of the class of film music projects you want to be able to take on.  Realize that if your vision is at all ambitious, you&#8217;re going to need to create a system of people and processes to handle these projects in a commercially-viable way.  Conceive of your system-building goal as a big task to be accomplished.  Then, as with any big task, break it down into smaller tasks, and tackle them one by one.<br /><br />Go forth, divide, and conquer.</div>

</div>Scoring for film is a collaboration between director and composer.  Collaborations are almost always creative in some way or another, but what happens when you remove some of that creative angle from the collaboration? What happens when a director asks you to go against your principles and imitate the style of another composer - take on their creative voice, and push yours aside?<br />
<br />
<br />
While reading the above job offer, a number of questions came to mind for me....<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: medium; font-weight: bold;">The Questions</span><br />
<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Crystal_Clear_app_lists.png" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Crystal_Clear_app_lists.png" style="cursor: pointer; float: right; height: 128px; margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; width: 128px;" /></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">1.</span> How do you deal with this and make it work in your favour, or do you just not even take the job in the first place?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.</span> Would it be ok to take a job like this in your early years, when you don't have a particular style/voice of your own?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">3.</span> If you are a professional composer, do you take a job like this, or would it be career suicide?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">4.</span> What harm do you think these offers are doing to the industry?<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll try and answer these myself (yes I know - having a questions and answers with myself is rather strange...possibly one of the signs of madness!) but I'd love to hear what you guys think on the subjects.  I'm by no means an expert on the subject, so hit me up in the comments and tell me what <span style="font-style: italic;">you </span>think!<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: medium; font-weight: bold;">The (Possible) Answers</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q:</span> "How do you deal with this and make it work in your favour, or do you just not even take the job in the first place?"<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A:</span> In my honest opinion, I think it would be beneficial to take this job either way if you are "starting off" (ie. in your first few years of becoming a film composer). I believe any experience is good experience - you might take away from the project not to ever do another that requires you to copy another composer's style, or you might learn a number of new techniques from imitating that composer's music.  One thing I have learnt in the past few years is the more mistakes you make in the beginning, the less you are likely to make further down the road.  Make your mistakes early in your career, screw things up and learn from it.<br />
<br />
One way to make the project work in your favour would be to discuss it with the director and say "OK, I <span style="font-style: italic;">can</span> write music like that, but how about I try it my way and see if you like it - if not we'll go with your original idea".  Prove to him that your own style would work better with the film, rather than an imitation of another score.  That way you might have a possibility of the director coming over to your side of thinking and saying "You know what - you're right - lets go with your style of scoring" - win!<br />
<br />
Another small point that I feel is important here, is how imitating another composer <span style="font-style: italic;">can</span> sometimes be beneficial to you.  When you imitate another composer, you learn his techniques, and even his thought process sometimes if you break down the original score enough. Imitating another composer can be a great compositional excercise and can work wonders for your creative side.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q:</span> "Would it be ok to take a job like this in your early years, when you don't have a particular style/voice of your own?"<br />
<br />
As Lee said, we all begin with that imitative phase of composing, so taking on a project like this <span style="font-style: italic;">could</span> be beneficial to us, as long as we remember what we're doing, and why we're doing it.  I would never have learnt how to score if I hadn't of imitated other film scores, at least for a short while, so as to learn scoring techniques for the orchestra and how to score for different types of scenes.  I think I would take on this job for the reason, but I wonder further down the road how likely I would be to do so.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q:</span> "If you are a professional composer, do you take a job like this, or would it be career suicide?"<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A:</span> I would love to hear from some of the professional composers as to what their stance on this is.  I think it would most likely be career suicide, but maybe you have all been around long enough to know what to do in this situation?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q:</span> "What harm do you think these offers are doing to the industry?"<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A: <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>I wonder sometimes do these offers really do any harm to the industry at all.  I mean, when you really think about it, what might be happening is that there are more and more imitative composers popping up out there who are looking for jobs like this.  Is that such a bad thing? Surely that means that original composers will become more sought after further down the line when the trends such as the Zimmer trend diminish (if it ever does)  - after all its the original composers who set those trends - not the imitative composers.<br />
<br />
Another thing to bare in mind is - there will always be requests like this from directors.  There always have been, and the always will be - all we can do is try and persuade them to come over to our side of thinking and show them that the film score is an art, and art should always be original.<br />
<br />
<br />
So there's my answers to the questions - I really would love to hear your answers and thoughts on these questions guys (how wrong I am or if I'm right!) - lets discuss them in the comments!<br />
<br />
How do <span style="font-style: italic;">you </span>think that the <a href="2009/09/vote-now-top-10-most-influential-scores.html">Top 10 Most Influential Scores of the Past Decade</a> have influenced the collaboration between composers and directors on films?<br />

Williams.</div><div><br />&#8220;There are many names for this new Web: the Web 2.0, the living Web, the Hypernet, the active Web, the read/write Web&#8230;. Call it what you like &#8211; the sentiment is the same. We&#8217;re all participating in the rise of a global, ubiquitous platform for computation and collaboration that is reshaping nearly every aspect of human affairs. While the old Web was about Web site, clicks, and &#8220;eyeballs,&#8221; the new Web is about communities, participation, and peering. As users and computing power multiply, and easy-to-use tools proliferate, the Internet is evolving into a global, living, networked computer that anyone can program. Even the simple act of participating in an online community makes a contribution to the new digital commons&#8230;.&#8221; (Tapscott, 19)</div><div><br />One of the greatest advancements in the Internet since it opened up to the public back in the 90s is the evolution from the publish-and-read Web to the collaborative Web &#8211; I call it &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221;. SCOREcast Online fits squarely into the spirit of Web 2.0. We are a community of composers and other music-for-media professionals engaging this site not only because of our love of the art and we want to read some cool stuff, but also to participate with one another &#8211; to network and work together on actual, real-world projects. We never would have been able to do this if not for Web 2.0 and the &#8220;proliferation of collaboration tools&#8221;. Nowhere, I believe, in the music-for-media composing community is the Web 2.0 benefit felt more keenly than in those that are just getting started, and/or those living outside Los Angeles, CA.</div><div><br />As one of these composers, (I wouldn&#8217;t consider myself &#8220;just starting out&#8221; for much longer, but I do live outside of LA) I have my list of favorite tools to collaborate with my fellow musical colleagues. For this month&#8217;s DIY STUDIO column, I&#8217;m listing my favorites &#8211; and I&#8217;d also like to find out what you SCOREcasters have as your favorites. Best of all, all of the items listed below are FREE. I love that word. The list below is not necessarily in any particular order, but I&#8217;m instead leaving it in the order I originally thought of the list. So if nothing else, you could say this list is in order of &#8220;top of my mind&#8221; for collaboration with filmmakers, composers, and the like. I will say though that, I&#8217;ve not had a chance to use some of these tools, but in my research over time, these are the ones that looked the most promising. I&#8217;ll note whether I&#8217;ve used each tool below; for those I haven&#8217;t used yet, I leave it to you to speak up in the COMMENTS section to rant or rave.</div><div><br /><strong>Dropbox </strong>(<a href="http://www.getdropbox.com/">http://www.getdropbox.com/</a>) &#8211; Dropbox is just plain cool and is my current #1 favorite collaboration utility. Say you&#8217;re working with another composer on a project. You finish your part of the cue, mix it down to a .wav file, and you want to get it to your partner asap. With Dropbox, all you have to do is drag the file over to a special &#8220;Dropbox&#8221; folder in your &#8220;My Documents&#8221; folder (or wherever else you choose). As soon as you drop the file there, Dropbox takes over in the background and copies it to whoever else is connected to your Dropbox. Translation- in practically real-time, your partner notices a new file is appearing magically in his Dropbox folder on his computer- your new .wav file. Maybe he grabs it and makes changes, copying it back to his Dropbox. The app notices the change and copies the file back to you, notifying you of the change. Faster and more transparent than email, less trouble than FTP &#8211; it just works. The first 2GB of storage space is free, with more storage available for a fee.</div><div><br /><strong>Facebook</strong> (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/">http://www.facebook.com/</a>) &#8211; Facebook is maybe the most ubiquitous of the Web 2.0 services, so I won&#8217;t dwell on it. If you&#8217;re one of the 37 or so people left on the planet not on Facebook, it is simply a platform to stay in touch with people: your friends, family, colleagues, bandmates, anyone. You connect as &#8220;friends&#8221; with people, which makes it possible to see things they post- messages on their wall, notes (sort of like blog posts), pictures, etc. Facebook is useful for collaboration largely because it&#8217;s very easy to find people and engage them. Just drink the Kool-Aid&#174; and get on.</div><div><br /><strong>Skype</strong> (<a href="http://www.skype.com/">http://www.skype.com/</a>) is the answer to many communication challenges, including long distance calling. Yes, Skype is a chat client, but its power is actually in its ability to host voice calls over the Internet (Voice over IP, or &#8220;VOIP&#8221;). So with a headset (or headphones and a mic), Skype lets you call any other Skype user, anywhere in the world, for any length of time, free of charge. Skype also offers Skype-to-phone service for a monthly fee, allowing you to use Skype as your main telephone (although there are disclaimers about reliability and &#8220;do not use for 911 services&#8221;). Skype also allows conference calls- also free of charge if everyone is on Skype. In fact, this is how the SCOREcast Round Table sessions are often accomplished- over Skype, with some sort of recording software (I prefer Freecorder [www.freecorder.com]) recording the conversation. In fact, with a little creativity, you can set up Skype to &#8220;send&#8221; your entire system&#8217;s sound to the other party. I&#8217;ve used a setup like this to work in real-time with the Director I work with on a documentary. He was in California, I&#8217;m in Texas- but it was as if he was sitting in the seat beside me. The only thing that would have made our Skype sessions even more productive would have been if he&#8217;d been able to see my screen as we worked together. If only we&#8217;d used something like&#8230;.</div><div><br /><strong>Dimdim</strong> (<a href="http://www.dimdim.com/">http://www.dimdim.com/</a>). Or <strong>Yuuguu</strong> (<a href="http://www.yuuguu.com/">http://www.yuuguu.com/</a>). Or <strong>Mikogo</strong> (<a href="http://www.mikogo.com/">http://www.mikogo.com/</a>). All three of these are desktop sharing plugins for Skype. This is where I admit I&#8217;ve not had the opportunity to use any of these products. In my day job we use Microsoft Live Meeting, which is a huge, robust, enterprise-scale collaboration product, including desktop sharing. The concept behind all these is whatever you see on your screen, the party on the other side sees the same thing. These products would have been very useful near the end of my documentary project when we were fine-tuning placement of cues in the film, but there are a number of other uses for services such as these- just think about it. You could have a bassoon player in New York eyeball or play for you music straight from your Sibelius. Or you could let a sound design guru take over your desktop to make some trippy tweaks in your copy of Omnisphere, then you could test out the cue with the new settings, as he listens. (Actually I don't think Dimdim has this feature, but the others do.) You could even work on a SCOREcast article together&#8230;&#8230;.. Speak up in the COMMENTS section if you have opinions about any of these products, or if you&#8217;ve found something better!</div><div><br /><strong>Jing</strong> (<a href="http://www.jingproject.com/">http://www.jingproject.com/</a>) is a cool service that lets you create video files of your screen, and post, send, or otherwise share them. Jing is actually the free web-only version of several other products available from <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/">TechSmith</a>, but it&#8217;s still useful for short demos, clips, and so on. The free version of Jing is limited to clips of 5 minutes in length or less, and the rendered screen capture file has a Jing watermark. But if you can work with that, no charge. If you want more capabilities &#8211; longer clips, editing, zoom / pan, etc., TechSmith has some great products you can buy. I&#8217;ve used their desktop product Camtasia, and it&#8217;s perfect for creating demos of stuff you may want to show people on your computer.</div><div><br />I&#8217;d like to hear from all of you! Sticking to the DIY STUDIO creed of no- and low-cost, I&#8217;m particularly interested in free services you&#8217;ve discovered. What collaboration products do you love?</div></div>

Having just wrapped our 10-day feature on the "The Top 10 Most Influential Scores of the Past Decade" as voted on by the SCOREcast community, Deane and Lee take this month's podcast to go head-to-head on why they think the list came out as it did.<br />
<br />
Also, Lee explains his "lesser love" of the "Lord of the Rings" scores, and Deane goes all "Michael Moore" on the film music community in a rant that lasts almost 9 minutes! <br />
<br />
If you thought the Roundtables were interesting, you won't want to miss this "shootout" with SCOREcast's two head honchos!<br />

(Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard)</i></b></span><br />
<br />
There has been much heated discussion this week about whether <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001877/">Hans Zimmer</a> can really be called an "influential" composer, but the proof seems to be in the pudding: Zimmer's output from 1999 until now is impressive, and includes first class film scores for thirteen of the highest grossing films of the past decade. It only seems fitting that he would take our #1 spot, and that SCOREcast readers would vote his score, co-written with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0314713/">Lisa Gerrard</a>, to Ridley Scott's epic masterpiece <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i> as the number one most influential score of the past decade.<br />
<br />
But before we get into the analysis of why <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i> took the top spot on our countdown, let's recap how we got to this point, starting with the beginning of the Top 10 list (click on any title to read SCOREcast analysis from each score, and comments from the SCOREcast readership):<br />

<b>HANS ZIMMER'S <i>GLADIATOR</i></b><br />
Ridley Scott's <b><i>GLADIATOR</i></b> was a critical and box office smash. It was nominated for 119 awards between the Oscars, BAFTA's, Golden Globes, among others, and won five of its nominated twelve Academy Awards. One of the more controversial of <b><i>GLADIATOR</i></b>'s honors was the Academy's "Best Original Music Score" nomination for  Hans Zimmer's score for the film. Despite sharing considerable credit with Lisa Gerrard and Klaus Badelt for the writing of <b><i>GLADIATOR</i></b>, only Zimmer was nominated for the Oscar. After a big win at the Golden Globes for Zimmer and Gerrard, the team lost the Oscar to Tan Dun's <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i>, a loss that subsequently  led to the Academy's move to bar nominations of scores by more than one composer for many years thereafter.<br />
<br />
In spite of all of that, however, not since James Horner's <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_%28soundtrack%29" title="Titanic (soundtrack)">Titanic</a></i> soundtrack (which sold millions) had a movie score been in such high demand.<br />
<br />
Leading up to the film's release, most people who were able to get an advanced copy of the score tossed it aside as "typical fare from Zimmer" and really didn't treat it with any kind of seriousness. This is why it is interesting that <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i> has gone on to become one of the most imitated scores in recent history, introducing the trend of the "mournful female vocal", ala Lisa Gerrard.&nbsp; More scores than we can count (<i>The Passion of the Christ</i>, <i>Troy</i>, <i>The Quiet American</i>, <i>Kingdom of Heaven</i>, etc.) have taken Zimmer up on his suggestion that sorrowful female chanting is the best way to invoke any sense of historic drama in a foreign land.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, Hans Zimmer is a product of his influences as a composer, and on several occasions has talked publicly about his being steered by the works of Wagner and Holst while writing the score for <i><b>GLADIATO </b></i>(more on this later). Particularly on several of the cues in <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i>, Zimmer created what he deemed was "early Roman music" (when in reality, nobody truly knows <i>what</i> that should sound like. This caused some controversy since the first and second acts of the film take place in Morocco. Speaking of this style in an interview shortly after the score was released, Zimmer commented on the reason he used heavy duduk playing and female vocals to help differentiate the two styles:<br />
<br />
<blockquote><blockquote><div align="JUSTIFY">Half of <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i> takes place in Morocco so I   think I have a fairly legitimate reason for using this style. But really   it was more that I loved Lisa Gerrard's voice.<span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>Lisa grew   up in Melbourne's Turkish community and she has a very strong style but there   is a purity about it and a truthfulness. Lisa is a formidable woman; she   is not just a 'Pop Diva', she has enormous intelligence, integrity, and   musicality. When I first contacted her about working with me on <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i> her she politely declined, saying it wasn't quite her cup   of tea, but when she saw some footage, she finally agreed and she was eager   enough to catch the next plane. I admire that attitude, I would much rather   work with somebody with that artistic integrity than with somebody who will   say 'yes' to anything. I needed to find a tender woman's voice because <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i>'s opening scene   is idyllic, a poetic image of a wheat field with a hand drifting over it   and all you hear is Lisa's voice. I wanted the music at that point to evoke   Maximus's home, to signify the place where he was happiest. Ultimately that   theme turns into the 'Elysium' music. But then I was also desperately trying to find a way of showing that our   main character, Maximus, was not really, in the beginning, associated with   the Roman Empire. He was a Spaniard. In fact, in passing, I've noticed that   Spain and Spaniards have been associated with many of my new scores. There   were two Spaniards in <i>The Road to El Dorado.</i> <i>Mission Impossible   2</i> starts in Spain and, of course, <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i> has a Spanish hero. When I compose, I start by trying to write at least somewhat geographically   but then you remember that so much music has its roots in the Middle East.   <br />
</div><br />
<br />
</blockquote></blockquote>Overall, <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i> is a truly remarkable score, if only for the legacy that has lived long after its release in other film scores of its ilk. Another notable  <i><b>GLADIATOR </b></i>remnant  &#8212; and the one that  Zimmer probably wishes everyone would forget about &#8212; is the lawsuit that stemmed from the score's release, citing an infringement by Zimmer and his way of gaining  inspiration in writing the music. In June 2006, agents representing the estate of composer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Holst" title="Gustav Holst">Gustav Holst</a> (1874&#8211;1934) filed a lawsuit claiming that Zimmer plagiarized material from the<i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Planets" title="The Planets">The Planets</a></i>. Specifically, "The Battle" was believed to plagiarize Holst's "Mars, the bringer of war"<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator_%28soundtrack%29#cite_note-0"></a></sup>. The track "Barbarian Horde" reprises most of these themes. Additionally, film music critics assessed that the score also borrows heavily from the works of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner" title="Richard Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>, particularly themes from <i>Siegfried and Gotterdammerung</i>, included in the latter half of "The Might of Rome" and "Am I Not Merciful?"<br />
<br />
If SCOREcast's list of the <u><i>Top 10 Most Influential Scores of the Past Decade</i></u> has taught us anything at all, it's that the more influential a score seems to be, the more scrutinized it also becomes. Hans Zimmer's score for <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i> might be one of the most investigated and examined score's in the history of film, yet his music for this epic motion picture is as much an influential force in the film music vernacular today as it was when it was released almost ten years ago.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why do you think Zimmer's music for <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i> was voted #1 on&nbsp; this list as being the most "influential"? How does it differ from other scores in the same genre in the last ten years? Does it compete with the work Zimmer has done for other projects in any way? Is it up to par with that work?<br />
<br />
Most interestingly, how has the music of <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i> affected your composing style or your thoughts on composing for picture? What other scores have you heard that are obviously influenced by <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i>?<br />

(Thomas Newman)</i></b></span><br />
<br />
A second-generation member of Hollywood's preeminent musical dynasty, composer <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002353/">Thomas Newman</a> weighs in on our countdown with the #2 most influential score of the past decade: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169547/"><i><b><span style="font-size: small;">AMERICAN BEAUT</span>Y</b></i></a><span id="intelliTXT">.</span><br />
<br />
<span id="intelliTXT"><i><b>AMERICAN BEAUTY</b></i> score was nominated for an Academy Award, but lost to John Corigliano's "The Red Violin". </span><span id="intelliTXT">Perhaps just what kind of influence Newman's score has bestowed on modern film composing can be summed up by a comment on the <i>Movie Music UK</i> website:&nbsp;</span><br />
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><span id="intelliTXT">"</span>It's difficult to know what to say about Thomas Newman's score, except that it can probably be summed up by one simple word: unconventional. You only need to look at the list of instruments used in the score's make-up to see what I mean - tablas, kim-kim drums, bird calls, mandolas, Appalachian dulcimers, lap steel guitars, ukuleles, arpeggiated violins, detuned mandolins. And a <i>saz</i> - whatever a <i>saz</i> is.<span id="intelliTXT">"</span><br />
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><br />
<span id="intelliTXT">The fact is that when <i><b>AMERICAN BEAUTY</b></i> was first released, most people didn't know what to make of Newman's score at all. It was so incredibly eclectic, that it was literally impossible to categorize. However, time has taught that there were two things that Newman's score would leave as a marked change in the way films are scored, particularly adult character-driven dramatic films: Two cues... "Dead Already" and "Any Other Name".</span><i><b><span id="intelliTXT">&nbsp;</span></b></i><br />
<br />
<i><b><span id="intelliTXT">"Dead Already"</span></b></i><br />
<span id="intelliTXT">"Dead Already", the lead cue in </span><span id="intelliTXT"><i><b>AMERICAN BEAUTY</b></i></span><span id="intelliTXT">, is a 3/4 time electro-acoustic whirlwind of marimba, guitar, tablas, detuned mandolin, dulcimer, lap steel, and various percussive odds and ends. It has become the quintessential cue associated with "quirkiness" in film scoring. Countless scenes in film that have come along since and required some sort of quirky, offbeat, and angular music to carry them have been temped with "Dead Already". The style of the cue has been requested over and over, even of Newman himself, who has struggled to work his way out of the cage that </span><span id="intelliTXT"><i><b>AMERICAN BEAUTY</b></i> more or less put him in. Fortunately, Newman's skills are magnificent, both as a composer and as an interpreter of cinema, that he has not had to toil too long in his own shadow.</span><br />

<br />
<i><b><span id="intelliTXT">"Any Other Name"</span></b></i><br />
<span id="intelliTXT">"Any Other Name"  is a minimalist piano theme, set over a spacial synth pad, which develops over time as two of the main characters begin to fall in love. As the cue unfolds, Newman brings in what has now become known as his signature sound &#8212; a lush, washy, and weighty string and woodwind section that breathes depth and dimension to the solitary piano lines. </span><span id="intelliTXT">"Any Other Name"</span><span id="intelliTXT"> has been used in temp after temp (<i>Akeelah and the Bee</i>; <i>About Schmidt</i>; <i>Lost in Translation</i>; <i>Fahrenheit 911</i>, etc.), commercial after commercial (<i>M&amp;M's</i>, <i>State Farm Insurance</i>, <i>First Alert Security Systems</i>, and dozens more), and even in theme parks (Six Flags' <i>Great America</i> and <i>Magic Mountain</i>). The haunting melodic theme &#8212; the only legitimate theme in the score &#8212; is as moving a piano line as there ever was, and when mixed with the visual in which it is paired with most remarkably in the film (a plastic bag swirling in the wind on a sidewalk), it evokes everything memorable about the film itself.</span><br />

</div><span style="font-size: small;"><b>#3 - THE BOURNE IDENTITY<br />
</b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><b><i>(John Powell)</i></b></span><br />
<br />
<span id="intelliTXT">Film music is a highly subjective artform. What really makes something musical in relation to a film has been changing since the days of the first "talkies", and the evolution of the medium is never standing still. Who would have ever thought that Hitch's <i>Psycho</i> shower scene would require nothing more from Herrmann than screaming violins &#8211; or that Williams would get away with a two-note theme in <i>Jaws</i>?</span><br />
<br />
<span id="intelliTXT">In 2002, when  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0694173/">John Powell</a>'s </span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258463/"><i><b>THE BOURNE IDENTITY</b></i></a> music hit the 5.1 decoder in theaters, most people wondered "How could a guy score a film using mainly pulse percussion, techno synth patterns, and flourishes of orchestral staccato?" In fact, Powell's music for this entire franchise is oddly served up: He never really commits to a main theme (the "Identity" <i>theme</i> from <b><i>TBI</i></b> is the most memorable of the three films) and he never really commits to a particular previously-established style. But two things are for sure: The tone of the Bourne films and the sounds Powell scores them with are all his own. <span id="intelliTXT">In most of the action sequences, Powell starts with some sort of either string or percussion pulse, adds increasingly complex techno-fused synth lines, and then builds in layers with orchestral padding until the  intensity within the scene is matched by the intensity of the music. Then, he quickly tosses whatever thematic elements he's cached aside, never to be heard again in many cases, and moves on to building up the next action set-piece in exactly the same way. At times, this "process" seems exhaustively repetitive...<br />
</span><br />
<span id="intelliTXT"><br />
</span><br />
<span id="intelliTXT">... Which might be this score's point of influence right there. <i><u>John Powell's score for </u></i></span><i><u><span style="font-size: small;"><b>THE BOURNE IDENTITY</b></span></u></i><span id="intelliTXT"><i><u> is repetitive</u></i>. But in a very enjoyable fashion. It simply doesn't annoy, and in fact, isn't noticeable until you listen to it disconnected from its cinematic experience. This "repetition" technique, now popular with a lot of loop-based and sample-heavy scores (and brought to its full realization in Powell's score for 2006's <i>United 93</i>), is derivative almost entirely of John Powell</span><span id="intelliTXT">, and might be the sole influencing factor that this score (and much of his subsequent work) has had on modern film scoring. Case in point:  Harry Gregson-Williams, Klaus Badelt, and Bryan Tyler seem to be trying to clone Powell's <i>identity</i> in many of their recent efforts.<br />
</span><br />
<br />
Why do you think John Powell's music for <i><b>THE BOURNE IDENTITY</b></i> was voted onto this list as being "influential"? How does it differ from other scores in the same genre in the last ten years? Does it compete with the work Powell has done for other projects in any way? Is it up to par with that work?<br />
<br />
Most interestingly, how has the music of <i><b>THE BOURNE IDENTITY</b></i> affected your composing style or your thoughts on composing for picture? What other scores have you heard that are obviously influenced by <i><b>THE BOURNE IDENTITY</b></i>?<br />

</div><span style="font-size: small;"><b>#4 - THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy<br />
</b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><b><i>(Howard Shore)</i></b></span><br />
<br />
<span id="intelliTXT"><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006290/">Howard   Shore</a>'s Oscar-winning,  Golden Globe-nominated, and Grammy Award-winning score to <i>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</i> was just the  beginning of an epic 12-hour long <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/"><i><b>THE LORD OF THE RINGS</b></i></a> saga that would push Shore into the immediate consciousness of not only film music fans, but music lovers the world over.</span><br />
<br />
<span id="intelliTXT">Throughout our "Most Influential Scores of the Past Decade" series, a lot of discussion has been raised about the importance of "themes". Well, if themes is what you want, then look no further than Shore's </span><i><b>LOTR</b></i> music, because there are over 40 themes fleshed out in the series. The three main themes (the ones you'll hear  incessantly in trailers, TV commercials, and even during pre-flight instruction videos for Jet Blue Airlines) are the Fellowship, Rohan, and Shire themes, but there are so many variants on these three themes during the course of the films that an entire coursework could easily be constructed around identifying them all.<br />
<br />
<span id="intelliTXT">Like the  films, Shore's thematic elements similarly evolved through the course of the  three installments. </span><span id="intelliTXT">As <i>The Two Towers</i> introduced and developed the Rohan theme as the  primary component to that film's story, <i>The  Return of the King</i> brings in and develops Shore's grand themes for the  people of Gondor and Minas Tirith.</span> <br />
<br />
Shore's other major feat was in his musical interpretation of a 5,000 year-old world &#8212; a world wholly conceived in J.R.R. Tolkien's imagination. In Shore's composition you can detect smatterings of influence from the Celtic songs of Turlough O'Carollan to the spicy textures of  Middle Eastern folk tunes; a hearty alchemy of  various other world folk and roots tones.<br />
<br />
<span id="intelliTXT">All in all, it is hard to even discuss Shore's achievement here, since the undertaking of scoring something like </span><i><b>LOTR </b></i><span id="intelliTXT">had to have been so exceptionally monumental, but </span><span id="intelliTXT">Shore's music for </span><i><b>LOTR </b></i><span id="intelliTXT">is  simply breathtaking and his  thematic development of the storyline is a masterclass in how it's done.</span><br />
<br />
Why do you think Shore's music for <i><b>LOTR</b></i> was voted onto this list as being "influential"? How does it differ from other scores in the same genre in the last ten years? Does it compete with the work Shore has done for other projects in any way? Is it up to par with that work?<br />
<br />
Most interestingly, how has the music of <i><b>LOTR</b></i> affected your composing style or your thoughts on composing for picture? What other scores have you heard that are obviously influenced by <i><b>LOTR</b></i>?<br />

</div><span style="font-size: small;"><b>#5 - THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN trilogy<br />
</b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><b><i>(Klaus Badelt/Hans Zimmer)</i></b></span><br />
<br />
Blaring brass, sawing strings, playful woodwinds, bombastic percussion, ghostly choirs... It's the latest release from EastWest! Uh... or a cue from the Jerry Bruckheimer/Disney franchise <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980/"><i><b>THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN</b></i></a>.<br />
<br />
Okay, look. We know this one is going to start a flame war... but before you comment on why this score is the end to all that's right and holy in our industry, just remember... YOU VOTED FOR THESE! <br />
<br />
<i><b>THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN</b></i> started out being something that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001877/">Hans Zimmer</a> never thought would amount to much <i>(TPOTC: The Curse of the Black Pearl; 2003)</i>, and ended up being probably one of the definitive works of his career <i>(TPOTC: At World's End; 2007)</i>. Originally handed off to protege <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0046004/">Klaus Badelt</a> to handle (with Zimmer "producing" as an overseer... Lead balloon, much?), <i><b>TPOTC</b> </i>might be solely responsible for the deluge of overproduced scores that we now have cluttering up the shelf space in our score CD collections.<br />
<br />
However, if you listen to modern scoring in action films these days, you'll notice remnants of <i><b>TPOTC</b></i> threaded through many things your hear. True, Zimmerites are Zimmerites and they mostly sound similar, careful not to stray too far from the proven RC/MV formula, but <i><b>TPOTC</b></i> was slightly different. It boasted a bit of a playful side from Zimmer that we hadn't seen in quite some time, maybe not since his work on 1998's <i>The Prince of Egypt</i>, where he let a bit of his tongue-in-cheekyness shine through on a few cues. That same tone peeked through in Badelt's work on the first <i><b>TPOTC</b></i> score in 2003, but really became the signature stroke of the series in 2006 when Zimmer put himself in the pilot seat for the remaining two sequels, starting with  his 2006 score to  <i><b>TPOTC: Dead Man's Chest</b></i>.<br />
<br />
<b><i>TPOTC: </i></b><span id="intelliTXT"><b><i>Curse of the Black Pearl</i></b> was annihilated by critics when it first came out because Badelt chose to mix his orchestra heavily with synthesized lines, making the music feel somewhat inauthentic to the genre and erasing some of the power that film score fans were used to in previous swashbuckling outings like John Debney's<i> Cutthroat</i><i> Island</i> and, to a lesser degree, Michael Kamen's <i>Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves</i>. But if Badelt's hand was too weary for wear, those same fickle critics would say Zimmer was "over the top" and "heavy handed" in his approach to the next two films. Regardless, a listen through the progression that the scores take from beginning to end make for  a body of work  that truly is a pleasure to listen through, no matter what side of the Zimmer fence you are on. Knowing that </span><i><b>TPOTC</b></i> was conceived by Disney to be a franchise, i<span id="intelliTXT">t is fascinating to hear how Zimmer carefully constructs each offering to be the foundation for the next.<br />
</span><br />
<span id="intelliTXT"><br />
</span><br />
<span id="intelliTXT">In terms of influence, perhaps the measuring rod of </span><i><b>TPOTC </b></i><span id="intelliTXT">is the standard it set of how  a score is now expected to "sound" as a final mix. The credit of Zimmer's contribution to the world of filmscore differs from each person you talk to (from revered to repulsed!), but one thing everyone can probably agree on is that before Hans Zimmer film music sounded one way, and since Hans Zimmer... well, film music just sounds <i>different</i>. The question as to whether that influence has been good or bad for the film music industry is something that will probably be debated until we are all dead and buried and Disney is prepping the "The Pirates of the Caribbean</span> 50th Anniversary Limited Gold Platinum Silver Tin Foil Pirate Hat Edition"!<span id="intelliTXT"><br />
</span><br />
<br />
Why do you think Zimmer's music for <i><b>TPOTC</b></i> was voted onto this list as being "influential"? How does it differ from other scores in the same genre in the last ten years? Does it compete with the work Hans has done for other projects in any way? Is it up to par with that work?<br />

</div><span style="font-size: small;"><b>#6 - THE MATRIX</b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><b><i>(Don Davis)</i></b></span><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0204485/">Don Davis</a>' score to the 1999 science-fiction action film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/"><i><b>THE MATRIX</b></i></a> is a smartly constructed symphonic score that combines dark and light tones  to bring the Wachowski Brothers' vision of not-too-distant-future human enslavement to vivid life.<br />
<br />
As a film, <i><b>THE MATRIX</b></i> was unique in that it came along at a time when cinema had become somewhat routine and static. The Wachowski's set the movie-going audience on their head with the visuals and high-concept storyline of <i><b>THE MATRIX</b></i> and really upped the ante in terms of the Hollywood formula. Many films in the same genre are blatantly derivitive of <i><b>THE MATRIX</b></i> aesthetic, and a case could be made that Davis' music had a lot to do with that.<br />
<br />
Scored for a large orchestra, and all but devoid of any electronic elements (the score was almost wholly acoustic while the source material handled the electronic vibe), <i><b>THE MATRIX</b></i> score revived many long-forgotten orchestral trends and re-introduced a certain grandeur to filmscore that had arguably been dormant since the late 1980's. Davis, who writes pencil to paper, used a decidedly organic approach to his score and the details are "felt" in <i><b>THE MATRIX</b>'s</i> cinematic experience. Davis' leanings on atonal orchestral power might be THE theme for <i><b>THE MATRIX</b></i>, if there is one at all.<br />
<br />
Since <i><b>THE MATRIX</b></i> braves such new territory  visually on so many groundbreaking levels, it is hard to ascertain just why Davis' score sticks with you as indelibly as it does. An obvious product of its own influences anyway, Davis' music for <i><b>THE MATRIX</b></i> contains elements made popular by the likes of franchise composers such as John Williams (STAR WARS), Danny Elfman (BATMAN), and John Barry (the BOND franchise), yet it carefully pays tribute to those scores without shamefully tipping its hat too far into out-and-out flattery. For example, Davis' repetitive use of dissonant brass clusters as a motivic device, while not in any way original, has caused that technique to enjoy somewhat of a  resurgence in contemporary scoring as of late. Similarly, his detailed string and woodwind "swirling" during the <i>Main Title</i> is now the go-to sound when a central character is "displaced" or "unstable" in a narrative action piece.<br />
<br />
Why do you think Davis' music for <i><b>THE MATRIX</b></i> was voted onto this list as being "influential"? How does it differ from other scores in the same genre in the last ten years? Does it compete with the work Davis has done for other projects in any way? Is it up to par with that work?<br />
<br />
Most interestingly, how has the music of <i><b>THE MATRIX</b></i> affected your composing style or your thoughts on composing in the same genre? What other scores have you heard that are obviously influenced by <i><b>THE MATRIX</b></i>?<br />

<span style="font-size: small;"><b><i>(Clint Mansell)</i></b></span><br />
<br />
In 2000, while still a relatively unknown composer, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0543739/">Clint Mansell</a> struck gold with a minimalist score for his second collaboration with director Darren Aronofsky, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180093/"> <i><b>REQUIEM FOR A DREAM</b></i></a>.<br />
<br />
Scored for only five musicians &#8212; the fabulous Kronos Quartet and Mansell himself on synthesizers &#8212; the music for Aronofsky's dark cautionary tale is stark and angular, utilizing the decidedly Herrmannesque method of cold, non-vibrato string lines against rigid, spacial synth textures.<br />
<br />
The main motif of the score is a simple three-chord progression that is used incessantly throughout the score, yet Mansell's overuse of the progression only serves to drive home the emotional beating that the storyline itself provides.<br />
<br />
As perhaps a testament to it's influence on modern scoring techniques, one of the most memorable tracks from Mansell's score is "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux_Aeterna_%28Requiem_for_a_Dream%29" title="Lux Aeterna (Requiem for a Dream)">Lux Aeterna</a>", which has not only become a favored temp track in almost every Hollywood music editor's playlist, but also has been used in countless forms of media including the television show "Lost" and the video game "Assassin's Creed". Over the years, <i><b>REQUIEM FOR A DREAM </b></i>has dominated as a go-to trailer music having been featured heavily in theatrical trailers for  "300", "The DaVinci Code", "Sunshine", "Zathura", and  dozens more.<br />
<br />
Why do you think Mansell's music for <i><b>REQUIEM FOR A DREAM</b></i><i><b></b></i> was voted onto this list as being "influential"? How does it differ from other scores in the same genre in the last ten years? Does it compete with the work Mansell has done for other projects in any way? Is it up to par with that work?<br />
<br />
Most interestingly, how has the music of <i><b>REQUIEM FOR A DREAM</b></i><i><b></b></i> affected your composing style or your thoughts on composing in the same genre? What other scores have you heard that are obviously influenced by <i><b>REQUIEM FOR A DREAM</b></i><i><b></b></i>?<br />

<span style="font-size: small;"><b><i>(Bear McCreary)</i></b></span><br />
<br />
Our second entry on the list from the world of television comes from relative newcomer <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0566970/">Bear McCreary</a> and his truly memorable and highly conceptualized score for the the SyFy reboot of the classic series <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407362/"><i><b>BATTLESTAR GALACTICA</b></i></a>.<br />
<br />
Credit goes to McCreary for  creating the feel of the show with music. In the early stages of conceptualization for the show, producers only gave him one directive: no themes. Beyond that, as has been widely publicized over the years, they were at a complete loss as to how the music should sound. Combining a blend of traditional orchestral elements, distorted and eBowed guitars, large format ethnic percussion, vocals, and synthesized textures, McCreary created a strong atmospheric world mix of styles and influences which features melodic references to Asian, Middle Eastern, and Irish music, among others &#8212; stylistically not what you would expect from a dirty, searing space opera.<br />
<br />
As much as the series itself is a fresh journey over familiar territory, McCreary's score provides the viewer with a new way to experience a world that we've seen some of before, yet make us fear the worst as if it was our first time to the "alien invasion" BBQ. The final fruit of his labors is music that eschews the usual science fiction pathos and brings to the screen a musically controlled chaos that feels fresh and new in the face of a well-worn genre. <br />
<br />
Why do you think McCreary's music for <i><b>BATTLESTAR GALACTICA</b></i> was voted onto this list as being "influential"? How does it differ from other scores in the same genre in the last ten years? Does it compete with the work McCreary has done for other projects in any way? Is it up to par with that work?<br />
<br />
Most interestingly, how has the music of <i><b>BATTLESTAR GALACTICA</b></i> affected your composing style or your thoughts on composing in the same genre? What other scores have you heard that are obviously influenced by <i><b>BATTLESTAR GALACTICA</b></i>?<br />
