					<description><![CDATA[Let me give everyone here a big tip.
Don&#039;t use loops or pads. Don&#039;t use pre-made string runs or a &#034;full&#034; orchestra patch. Write your own music, note for note. Otherwise, you won&#039;t grow and your music will sound bland and generic. You are writing freaking orchestral music, not some two bit rock track. 

Using pre-made loops and full ensemble patches is everything that&#039;s wrong with writing today. I don&#039;t quite understand how people can actually present a piece stating they wrote it, when in fact they did not. If sections are not written by you, but just placed inside the project, you should be ashamed of yourself. 

If someone says, make this score into sheet music, and you are not able to, you need to do some self revaluation. 

Learn to do what the hell you say you do. You write orchestral music? Then do it, and don&#039;t rely on cheap tools to make you look better.

Now, I understand that some may say &#034;we don&#039;t have time in such a tight deadline.&#034; To be frank, 99% of the time that&#039;s total BS, and just denial that helps you sleep at night. If you are working on an actual television show, and need to produce 20 minutes of music a week, then I can start to see why. But if you learn how to orchestrate properly (as no one does these days), writing strings runs and brass textures should take a couple minutes. It would be more original and fit the piece more adequately if you write them yourself.

Once again. If you want to call yourself an orchestral composer, be one. You all know who you are.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi it&#039;s me again - just wanted to share some thoughts around templates. I see the advantages of setting up a template or several templates according to your needs but one thing I&#039;ve found really frustrating is when you want to create say a new template and choose big music libraries like Hollywood Strings where the RAM is just never enough unless you have 5 PC&#039;s with lots of RAM but then this would probably cost a fortune and not many people can afford this unless you&#039;re in the Business and making a living from this. I am always looking for the great sound out from orchestral librairies and there&#039;s nothing more frustrating than loading a huge 1st violins with its numerous mic positions and finding you&#039;re already using 5 to 6 GB of RAM! Imagine loading up the rest of the strings with its different articulations.... Surely we could do a much better job at how the RAM and stream from disk works today. Anyway this is probably getting too technical here so anyway this is just some thoughts I wanted to share with the world. Cheers. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Service.

I wonder how long it&#039;s not really been about the music, because well, &quot;everyone can write music&quot;. Heck, you can even get a Chinese to write music for you for peanuts over the internet.

I do agree about the name brand and surely it seems to work for some people and consumers, but I don&#039;t personally buy into &quot;just the name&quot; being valuable as for me the music matters more than the person writing it. And the production experience surely matters for the production team and the director!

It&#039;s the whole package that you&#039;re selling, not a particular aspect of it. But given that the music is not always enough, then I&#039;d vote that it&#039;s quality of service, easy-going and trouble-free collaboration and price that make or break a deal.]]></description>

I&#039;ve been writing everything on post-its... on the mixer...
Once again, Scorecast tells me things I didn&#039;t know that I needed to know.
Thanks Yaiza! :D]]></description>

No problem! :) 

In case youÂ´re interested, not only you have Notes where I mentioned but also specific notes under each track in the Mixer in case you want to write something down for that track precisely as opposed to the whole project. Thanks for reading and commenting, David!]]></description>

Hi Glenn! Thanks for your kind words, good to know it is helpful! :)
Actually I would like to write another article just about the sub-templates because I use them SO much. I find them really useful and time saving! Your questions:

I do use different sub templates according to instrument family and main articulations of each, for example Subtemplate Strings (legato, sustains, pizz, staccati - you name it), Subtemplate Brass (idem) etc instead of just one big Orchestral Template. This is just my way but helps me add very quickly some instrument in different styles, in such a way that strings can be added to orchestral stuff and pop, for example. Again this changes if youÂ´re writing very often on one particular style such as orchestral (then youÂ´d most likely need a specific template for that) but for me it saves time and resources and allows big flexibility. The sub templates I create as independent projects directly under Logic main folder (inside Music in your main HD) and like this my Logic browser can find them very quickly.

About the content of the sub template, I for one donÂ´t include plugins because I want to adapt them to every individual project; otherwise IÂ´m afraid IÂ´d tend to use always the same reverb for example and IÂ´d feel tempted to sounding quite similar all the time, but this is just me. 

In general, for me working module like instead of using big templates helps me keep my workflow agile and open - but maybe because I donÂ´t seem to be asked twice to write in the same style! Again, this all must serve your writing so you can be as specific and specialised as you wish in your set up, which is the beauty of it :)
Anyway I hope to write more about this subject in a separate article, let me know if you have more questions or I didnÂ´t manage to explain myself! 

Thanks for commenting and happy writing!]]></description>

Thanks so much David! Glad to be of any help, IÂ´m far from having the biggest experience or knowledge in many fields but the little I know IÂ´m happy to share if it can be helpful for others. I work quite comfortably in Logic so it would be great to see other Logic users get the same positive experience! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Yaiza, thanks a lot for these fantastic hands-on work flow tips! Amazingly simple and powerful... Regarding sub-templates: would it be a good practice to build several instrument modules and import those at will when working on a project, in order to keep CPU overhead down, rather than building a giant orchestral + ethnic + synths + soundscapes template? And if so, how would you go about creating these subtemplates? As genuine templates or as projects in some dedicated folder? And how much would you load inside the template? (i.e. you can load settings without loading the actual plugins for example)... So many questions :-) I love seeing more!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Again John, thank you for information on DP.  I have pro tools 8 LE and I got it because I wanted Sibelius because the same company uses them (AVID).  I want to know does PT do the same as DP with film scoring or is one easier than the other.  Also does DP support Sibelius on its platform?  It seems I see you are speaking strictly film music.  Can DP be used for composing in other forms of music, like hip hop, jazz arranging, etc? I&#039;m asking because I want to upgrade to pro tools 10, but I really need to have a little feedback on what I&#039;m asking.  Thank you very much.,,Kenny]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Again John, thank you for information on DP.  I have pro tools 8 LE and I got it because I wanted Sibelius because the same company uses them (AVID).  I want to know does PT do the same as DP with film scoring or is one easier than the other.  Also does DP support Sibelius on its platform?  It seems I see you are speaking strictly film music.  Can DP be used for composing in other forms of music, like hip hop, jazz arranging, etc? I&#8217;m asking because I want to upgrade to pro tools 10, but I really need to have a little feedback on what I&#8217;m asking.  Thank you very much.,,Kenny</p>

Thanks Rob!
IÂ´m very happy to hear that, I find colouring them very helpful because in an instant I have a visual idea of what the structure of the cue will be - I find that so important for writing to picture, where the rhythm is determined...by the footage! :)]]></description>

Â Thanks Jorge! Well I do love many of LogicÂ´s features for writing to picture and IÂ´m very used to working with it (so I love the tool so to speak) but I overall love the idea of having a choice between many platforms of all sorts - keeps up the need of offering more and better to audio professionals. Logic is the DAW IÂ´ve used the most so it does feel home to me! :)]]></description>

Â Hi Stephen,

Apologies for taking me so long to get back to you.
I for one have always used 48k for scoring to picture (as opposed to other kind of writing), I can also confirm itÂ´s the current industry standard recommended for scoring to picture in Logic (by Apple certification programme I mean) Â  - however so far I am not aware that if itÂ´s affected by the sample rate of the libraries used. Maybe some other composers can share their input on this?]]></description>
