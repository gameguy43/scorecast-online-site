				<description><![CDATA[A library in reverse? The description may raise a skeptical eyebrow or two, but REV turns out to be an extraordinary library from a new kid on the block who instantly acquires respect. Guy Rowland takes you through the particulars.]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit I was skeptical. An entire library based around the concept of reversing stuff? <em>Gimmicky, one trick pony and probably redundant anyway</em>, I mumbled to myself. It&#8217;s not hard to reverse stuff, and you only need it for a few odd bits of effects anyway. Just a bit of PR spin and some flashy graphic design, I thought. Sheesh.</p>
<p>And then I played it.</p>
<p>What an extraordinary library it has turned out to be, from a brand new developer who instantly acquires respect and admiration. This is a library that has arrived from apparently nowhere, fully formed, is highly useful and also beautifully produced and engineered. I can barely level a criticism at it, in fact, and far from it being good only for occasional effects, it&#8217;s somehow managed to make itself very broad and genuinely useful on a day to day basis. The real question is – how did they make it so good from such an unpromising concept?</p>
<h2>ENGINE</h2>
<p>REV is a Kontakt Player library and it requires 5.3 to run (the library won&#8217;t work on 5.2.x). Download and installation is via Continuata – I&#8217;ve had more than my fair share of problems with Continuata in the past, but it downloaded the 6.5gb library hitch-free. Not the fastest on the block, but no slouch either.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2130" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/REV-Timed_Instruments_02.png" alt="REV-Timed_Instruments_02" width="632" height="416" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/REV-Timed_Instruments_02.png 632w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/REV-Timed_Instruments_02-389x256.png 389w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" /></p>
<h2>PATCHES</h2>
<p>The first thing that strikes you is the apparent lack of patches – <em>four</em>, to be precise. But as their names suggest, this is very much the tip of the iceberg, since each nki is actually a core container for literally hundreds of different patches. There are Instruments, Loops, Rises and Timed Instruments (a variation on basic Instruments where samples are loaded into RAM for smooth time-stretching).</p>
<p>Starting with Instruments, the first place to go is the instrument browser, which has subfolders for Fundamentals, Simple and Complex Pads, Pulses, Swells, Plucked, ReTron, Simple (basic reverses), Sling, Sound Design, Stutter One Shots, Aggressive, Percussive and User Presets. Each of these contain dozens of patches, so you quickly realize that this is a vast library indeed.</p>
<p>Things start off much as you might expect – some cool, very well executed reverse patches that evoke modern soundtracks like Breaking Bad or quality documentaries (er, not the Discovery Channel kind!). Then quickly you realize that the reversed angle can be very subtle, even not really noticeable in many cases. There&#8217;s an organic quality to a lot of the sounds, which is very pleasing – it has one foot in the land of the real, and it rarely sounds electronic (except for the pulses, which are deliberately not organic). The simple pads are instantly playable  and mostly based around real instruments (piano, guitars, cello, clarinet etc). They typically evoke the instrument that they are derived from, but its staggering how far the basic reverse concept appears to take things. Often it sounds more frozen than reversed – there&#8217;s plenty of patches without that distinctive sharp reversed end. And yet they always sound lifelike, with movement that makes it sound real if slightly other-worldly. The ReTron section takes it further, with a sharp attack and no release, while the slings play tricks such as starting forwards and then reversing at the mid-point.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2131" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/REV-Rises_01.png" alt="REV-Rises_01" width="632" height="416" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/REV-Rises_01.png 632w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/11/REV-Rises_01-389x256.png 389w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" /></p>
<h2>USER INTERFACE</h2>
<p>With any patch loaded, you&#8217;ll now be able to manipulate it using the excellent and intuitive interface. There are on/off switches for lo-fi, rage (distortion), stack (amp sim), filter, delay, reverb and EQ, and clicking on the names gives you access to the controls. The instrument patches are made up of two layers, each with stutter (volume and pitch) sections, the overall filter and envelope ADSR along with layer volume, pitch and pan, while loops and rises have just the one layer (with the same controls). It&#8217;s staggeringly easy to just dive and and tweak a sound beyond all recognition – the controls are all well chosen.</p>
<h2>LOOPS AND RISERS</h2>
<p>Reversed sounds and riser effects typically arrive with a bunch of problems that get slapped in your lap. If you&#8217;re playing a chord with that classic reversed end of note, the tails will typically end at different times for each note, resulting in an ugly mess which destroys the effect. Not so here – the library has been painstakingly designed to eliminate this nastiness completely – all the notes time themselves to end at the right point. And as for rises, which might be hit and miss to get to end at a hit point, the best solution until now is to find the source WAV and plonk it onto the timeline, lining it up by eye. This isn&#8217;t possible here, as the samples are contained in locked monoliths, but they go one better: You can chose how many bars you want your riser to stretch across, with or without a tail. Brilliant – no more endless juggling around the piano roll making your riser time correctly. Also useful, there&#8217;s also half/double-speed options for the loops and risers.</p>
<p>Speaking of loops and risers, these sections are every bit as versatile as the instruments. The same acoustic instrument-based stuff is there and complemented with high, mid and low pulses, percussion, cymbals, shakers etc. In all of these, the keyboard is split, with the lower part controlling pitch and the upper 2 octave&#8217;s worth of variations which can be performed, combined and layered.</p>
<p>Kudos to Output for  knocking their debut release way, way out of the park. Admittedly I&#8217;ve only scratched the surface of the huge treasure trove it contains, but honestly there&#8217;s nothing I can find fault with. Nothing. The library is vast, top quality, diverse, inspiring, usable and tweakable. Often you find yourself waiting for a 1.1 of the library to get the gremlins ironed out or expand on the range of options – in this case I find myself realizing that 1.0 just works brilliantly and instead I take to wondering how on earth they can top it for whatever they library release next.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Many might argue that Hollywood is more concerned these days about having "hit films" than it is about creating successful ones. What's the difference?]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p>What kind of &#8220;professional&#8221; walks out on a film set to start production in less than two weeks?James Franco does, that&#8217;s who. That&#8217;s right. After already spending half a million on pre-production just weeks away from shooting, James Franco pulled out of GARDEN OF LAST DAYS, a film he was directing and starring in. The reason? According to Mike Flemming at <em>Deadline Hollywood:</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Franco’s exit had to do with a disagreement with financier Millennium over the crew he wanted to hire. Basically, Franco put together a crew that didn’t &#8220;have the experience&#8221; to get approval from the bond company. Millennium wouldn’t approve his choices.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p>There are a couple different ways to interpret what happened. I realize we are armchair quarterbacking this and not privy to exactly what happened. But think about it with me for a moment. One possible scenario is that Millennium just did not want to do the project any more out of their fear it would lose money and they quietly, under the table, told the bond company to not approve the crew. This would allow them to save the relationship with their star Franco and blame the film not happening on the faceless bond company. That is a possibility. Also&#8230;I am told the bond company does not really care if the film is good&#8230;just if the film can be done on the budget laid out. It is possible the $3M budgeted was certain to go way over budget and the crew assembled did not have the experience to navigate a tight budget. They most likely met with everyone they would have been concerned about&#8230; and discovered the way they are wanting to shoot, there would be no way they were going to only spend $3M. The bond company estimation could have been much higher to finish the film Franco wanted to make and so determined his crew didn&#8217;t know how to be efficient with their choices. That is also possible for sure. But part of me thinks something else may be going on.</p>
<p>James Franco is a rather talented guy who has shown his talent both in front of and behind the camera. He also is someone in this industry who I would consider to be a true &#8220;artist&#8221;. I have always felt he is creating art when he works. He takes chances. He works on both indies and Blockbusters. He breaks barriers. And he has also finally earned the respect of many in Hollywood as an &#8220;A-list&#8221; actor. There is little doubt he knows what he is doing when it comes to making a successful film. So why would a studio/bond company trust him enough to hire him as a director, but not trust his choices for his crew?</p>
<p>I was speaking with a director/producer friend of mine.  He is an active AMPAS member, respected by his peers, and use to be a studio executive in addition to his producing work. So he has been on both sides of the process of making and releasing a film. He knows what he is talking about. He shared with me a profound concept that explains how to interpret what is going on in Hollywood here. And he learned it from Hal Prince, an American theatrical producer and director who has worked on many of the best-known Broadway musical productions of the past 50 years. Hal has garnered twenty-one Tony Awards, more than any other individual, including eight for directing, eight for producing the year&#8217;s Best Musical, two as Best Producer of a Musical and three special awards. Cabaret, West Side Story, Cats, Evite, Phantom Of The Opera. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Hal said there is a difference between a &#8220;Hit&#8221; &amp; a &#8220;Flop&#8221; and a &#8220;Success&#8221; &amp; a &#8220;Failure.&#8221; One set of terms has to do with money&#8230;the other does not.</p>
<p>A <em><strong>hit</strong></em> makes money. Lots of money.<br />
A <em><strong>flop</strong></em> does not.</p>
<p>A <em><strong>success</strong></em> is not tied to money but whether if it is successful in what it set out to do. (Tell a compelling story, entertain, etc&#8230;)<br />
A <em><strong>failure</strong></em> is unsuccessful in completing its goals.</p>
<p>How does this apply to Hollywood today? Many might argue that Hollywood is more concerned these days about having &#8220;hit films&#8221; than it is about creating film successes. A hit does not necessarily have to be a successful film. In fact, I would argue many hits today are not very successful films. How many times have you gone to see the latest blockbuster film and left the theater saying to yourself, &#8220;that was just not a good film.&#8221; And yet it made millions at the box office opening weekend. It was a hit. But as a film&#8230;it was a failure. Disney&#8217;s <em>John Carter</em> is a recent example many considered to be in the flop category. They did take a $200M write down on the film after all and Rich Ross resigned from his position at Disney over it.</p>
<p>On the contrary, there are many films that were extremely successful, but flops at the box office. Going back a bit into the 90&#8217;s, <em>Pleasantville</em> completely changed how the industry worked in Post-Production. A change still in effect today.  It was the first film to use a Digital Intermediate throughout the entire Post process for its groundbreaking color effects. Previous to this, the digital intermediate was used sparingly for FX shots only. Most people I know love the film and all of those associated with the film are very well-respected in Hollywood for their work on that film. It was truly a success in everything it set out to do and changed Hollywood for the better. But financially at the box office it was actually a flop.</p>
<h2>A New Paradigm</h2>
<p>We have to recognize that the financiers and studios today are much more interested in hits than successes. Despite his proven track record of success in film, Franco still could not get his chosen crew to get approved on this little $3 million dollar indie film. This is not hundreds of millions of dollars we are talking about here, but a very low budgeted $3M indie. And Millennium Films, according Deadline Hollywood, would apparently not approve his flop of a crew. Reading between the lines, I keep coming back to the thought that just because some on the crew had not made a $100M dollar hit film, does that necessarily mean they don&#8217;t know what they are doing on a $3M indie film? No. It doesn&#8217;t. The next Tariq Anwar (Editor &#8211; <em>The King&#8217;s Speech, American Beauty</em>), Freddie Young (Cinematographer &#8211; <em>Lawrence Of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago</em>) or Jerry Goldsmith could be among that young crew.</p>
<p>I continue to speculate here, but does anyone really think James Franco would be putting a crew together for a film he was reportedly passionate about that could not pull off what he wanted to do with this little indie? I don&#8217;t. I think the true artist in James was putting together the exact crew perfect to make THAT film&#8230;and yet because some of them were not on the Millennium short list of dept. heads in town, the financiers and bond company (who are experts at the numbers game and not artists and filmmakers) got nervous and began to butt heads with Franco. They did not trust him and his directing choices and probably lost interest in the project and were concerned it would be a flop.  Whether Millennium put the bond company up to not approving the project or not, we will never know. But Franco, out of true loyalty to his film&#8217;s vision and his chosen crew that he believed in, simply walked away. Proving to those around him that there is more to this business than making a hit.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong: The hits <em>are</em> important. They help the studio&#8217;s fund other productions. They <em>must</em> have hits. But if Hollywood is going to start making successful original films again, the films that will become iconic and remembered for generations to come, it is going to have to stop putting a &#8220;hit requirement&#8221; on everything it produces and take more chances across the board on both original stories and young, talented people. Especially the $3M indies like Franco&#8217;s GARDEN OF LAST DAYS and other &#8220;entry-level films&#8221; that are the proving grounds for the future generation of filmmakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&#8230;as composers..how does this apply to us,&#8221; you ask? Well, if you have never had a &#8220;hit&#8221; film&#8230;that does not mean you are not a successful composer. It does not mean you don&#8217;t know what you are doing or talking about. It means the folks out there that may be saying that are confused about the difference between a hit &amp; a flop and a success &amp; a failure. They are not the same. They are exclusive of one another. As a composer, you need to simply focus on making every film score you work on a success and stop worrying about whether it is attached to a hit. Does your music make the film better? Does it do its job well? Did you write a successful score? That is what you should be focusing on.</p>
<p>Hal Prince had it right.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[In the second part of SC's Template series, learn about the technology and methods involved in building an orchestral template.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to SCOREcast’s Orchestral Template series! This time, we will delve a bit into the technical background of creating a template. There are some ways in which a template can be set up, each of them more suited to a particular workflow and situation. But don’t worry &#8211; it won’t get too technical <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>In a nutshell, there are two general ways of hosting a template:</p>
<p>1) Inside the sequencer</p>
<p>2) Outside the sequencer (go figure!)</p>
<p>Hosting your template inside your sequencer mainly has the advantage of being easy to set up by not requiring any additional software or even hardware. Such a template works much the same way as a regular project you are working on. You load the sequencer file and are good to go. The settings of the template (the instruments loaded into it as well as for example CC values) are unique to this project and are automatically present when opening the file. Sounds good, doesn’t it? It _is_ good, but there’s more!</p>
<p>Here is where a template outside of your sequencer comes into play. Having your sequencer just play host to all those tracks, but not actually process the instruments has a number of key advantages:</p>
<p>&#8211; The sequencer just stores MIDI data and possibly audio data (if you use recordings/loops…). This keeps it mean and lean and usually results in a much snappier user experience.</p>
<p>&#8211; If multiple projects use the same (or more or less the same) set of samples, you can use the same template. This means that when switching between projects, the samples can stay loaded and you only need to load the (small) project file into the sequencer.</p>
<p>&#8211; If you are using a 64bit host, hosting plugins externally allows you (depending on the method used) to use 32bit plugins „inside“ 64bit projects without resorting to a bit bridge, which tend to be notoriously unstable.</p>
<p>&#8211; Plain and simple, some instruments simply work better in an external host. Sounds weird, but it’s the truth.</p>
<p>&#8211; Last but not least, externally hosted instruments can also mean externally hosted as in „on a different machine“. As you will see (or probably already know), this is dead easy. If set up right, there is no visible or audible difference between instruments hosted on your DAW and instruments hosted on another machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
<p>Before having a look at the various methods of creating an externally hosted template, lets briefly look at some of the technical aspects. Like with most software applications, a template requires CPU power and lots of RAM as well as fast storage. All this also applies to running individual virtual instruments, but in the case of templates it is much more pronounced.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Memory (RAM):</strong> As discussed in part I, a template contains all the instruments/articulations you commonly use, quite often multiple patches with the same articulations from different libraries. In any given piece, you will end up just using a subset of all that is there. Even though it is possible to largely purge the unused samples from memory, all these instruments still need a sizable amount of RAM to stay loaded. For creating a template, having as much physical (!) memory as possible is a must. For a small orchestral template, figure in at least 16GB. That will leave a bit of headroom for the sequencer and Operating System. 32 GB is pretty decent and 64GB will allow you to host a pretty large template on a single machine. While speed is important, size is more. You will not see a huge difference between RAM clocking at 1600 MHz or 1800 MHz. But you will feel the difference between 24 and 32 GB!</li>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> Most sample-based instruments use scripting for producing the sound you want to hear. That means that every time you play a patch, some CPU cycles will be used for calculations inside the script. Fortunately, almost all libraries are programmed relatively well so that CPU time is only used when the instrument is actually doing something. Unless you happen to use one of the rare exceptions or use VIs that use CPU power all the time, your CPU load should not be much higher than on regular projects even with a large template. Figure in some additional CPU load for the hosting software, but all in all CPU cycles will be the least of your problems.</li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong> With rare exceptions, sampled instruments only load a small part of the full sample into the system memory. The rest is streamed from disk while playing. This small part at the beginning, called the preload buffer, serves to give the sampler something to play while it is loading the rest of the sample when needed. How well this process works largely depends on how fast your drive is able to read the rest of the file. If it is not fast enough, you will hear clicks, pops or missing notes. If that happens, the preload buffer needs to be increased. If you have a very fast drive, you can lower the preload buffer greatly. So, in a nutshell: The faster your drives are, the less data you need to load into memory and the more instruments can you load in total. That means that while drive speed is about as important as it is with regular projects, your template will nevertheless benefit greatly from fast drives. Obviously SSDs are best, but expensive.</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong> Should you wish to host parts of your template on another machine or even multiple machines, depending on the method used you will need additional hardware. If both MIDI data to the template and audio data back to your sequencer are handled via LAN, you will need an ethernet cable to connect the machines. If you have more than one slave machine, use a switch to connect. If you also need to get audio back separately to the sequencer, you might also need an additional audio interface. Make sure all network cards involved support gigabit speed. Also use compatible Cat5 or Cat6 cables. There is very little you can do wrong here, fortunately. Sometimes onboard network chips have issues like constant crackles or pops. If that happens to you, simply get a dedicated network card.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>External Setups</h2>
<p>When setting up a template where the instruments are hosted outside your sequencer, there are four different setup styles. Each way to set things up has advantages (+) and disadvantages (-). Usually one template will mix these approaches depending on the nature of the instruments to set up:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hosting instruments/patches outside the sequencer: What you do here is have as many instruments as possible running outside the sequencer. MIDI gets sent to the instrument, its audio comes back. Very easy and straightforward.
<p>+ Easy to set up, everything inside your sequencer feels as usual, no changes in workflow<br />
&#8211; Requires a lot of audio tracks going back into the sequencer, thus very heavy on the network when using slaves</li>
<li>Like 1, but with grouped audio channels: Instead of having each instrument’s audio going back to the sequencer separately, you can group instruments together. This may be on a smaller scale like all Flute patches together, or much broader, for example all high woodwinds. Primarily it depends on how similar the instruments are in usability and how much your connection can still handle.
<p>+ Saves a lot of audio tracks, lets you adjust whole instruments quickly.<br />
&#8211; Individual instruments can not be processed separately. Make sure to only combine instruments that will receive the same post-processing.</li>
<li>Post-processing outside the sequencer: Instead of getting the direct plugin audio back on single tracks (1) or grouped (2), especially for large templates it can make sense to to do all needed post-processing of the sound outside of the sequencer. This includes panning, adding reverb, EQing individual instruments and maybe even some light compression on some sounds. This means that what goes into your sequencer is the production-quality final sound, ready for export. This approach makes most sense if the FX chain stays the same all the time with no tweaks needed.
<p>+ What you hear is the final sound. Set it up once, have it in all projects.<br />
&#8211; Making changes can be cumbersome; exporting the untreated sound means switching stuff off in the template.</li>
<li>Audio to a different application/output: If you are the lucky owner of a kick-ass mixing desk or use special software for that purpose (for example a dedicated PT rig), you can also route the audio to this external source directly from the template instead of first feeding it back to your sequencer.
<p>+ As flexible as you can get in terms of routing<br />
&#8211; Harder to set up; also it usually requires some sort of external audio interface or virtual audio cables (like JACK).</li>
</ol>
<p>So much for today. I hope you got some idea of how to approach planning a template. In part III, we will have an in-depth look at the most popular solution for building templates, VSL Vienna Ensemble Pro 5 before finally planning an example template in part IV. Until then, keep writing great music! As always, write your feedback and questions in the comments.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Although some have the luxury of working with live musicians, samples are a reality for a great many composers. Let's look at some trends that took root in 2010.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2010 was a great year for sample libraries. Although some of  us have  the luxury of working with live musicians, samples are the  reality for  a great many composers. In my inaugural post here at <a href="../../.." target="_self">SCOREcastOnline.com</a>, share some trends I observed in the sample library world last year.</p>
<p><strong>Increasingly Powerful Sample Libraries</strong><br />
By the end of 2009, the idea of running comprehensive orchestral   templates from a single machine seemed a real possibility. In 2010,  however, the stakes have been raised again with bigger libraries  demanding more  power than ever. Last year we saw increased multi-core  support, CPU power advancements, huge amounts of RAM, 64-bit  compatibility, and an increased  uptake of SSDs. In addition, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.viennaensemblepro.com/" target="_blank">Vienna Ensemble Pro</a> (released late 2009)  made it cost-effective and easy to set up  multiple machines. Developers  are now seizing this opportunity to  increase the power of their  libraries. Sample playback engines such as <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.native-instruments.com/#/en/products/producer/kontakt-4/" target="_blank">Kontakt</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.soundsonline.com/play/" target="_blank">PLAY</a> continue to  grow in sophistication meaning that modern libraries are  being able to  truly take advantage of multiple microphone positions,  complex  scripting, customized interfaces with more velocity layers and  larger  pools of round-robin samples. All of these demand more and more  power  from DAWs.</p>
<p><strong>New Standards in Sampling</strong><br />
From extensive string projects with top Hollywood engineers to   percussion libraries recorded in premiere London studios, new standards  were  set in the recording of sample libraries. Multiple microphone  positions, improved  legato/portamento, customized interfaces and more  intuitive programming  mean that the bar continues to be raised.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Workflow</strong><br />
In 2010 there were a lot of developments in areas designed to help  with  composers&#8217; workflows. It&#8217;s amazing to think that only twelve months  ago,  there were no string or choir libraries with polyphonic legato.  Now you  have <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.soundsonline.com/Hollywood-Strings" target="_blank">Hollywood Strings</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.tonehammer.com/?p=4276" target="_blank">Requiem</a>, and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cinesamples.com/products/voxos/" target="_blank">Voxos</a>. In addition, VSL released  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vsl.co.at/en/65/71/1877/1528.vsl" target="_blank">Vienna Instrument Pro</a> adding polyphonic legato to their enormous catalog of sample libraries.  AudioBro went one step further adding  polyphonic legato linked to a <em>smart divisi script</em> to create their <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.audiobro.com/" target="_blank">LASS</a> Auto-Arranger. Native Instruments released <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.native-instruments.com/#/en/products/producer/powered-by-kontakt/session-strings/" target="_blank">Session Strings</a> with the <em> automator</em> for easily creating rapid spiccato passages. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.projectsam.com/Products/Boxed-Products/1367" target="_blank">Symphobia 2</a> focused on pre-recorded unison/octave ensembles and pre-orchestrated  textures. Although late in the year, Cinesamples&#8217; <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cinesamples.com/products/cineorch/" target="_blank">CineOrch</a> may have  truly been one of the most remarkable and controversial  releases  featuring fully orchestrated tutti chords and octaves.</p>
<p><strong>Highly-focused Products</strong><br />
Although we had some extensive libraries, we also saw a lot of   highly-focused products. Rather than try to be the ultimate string   library or piano library we had pianos focused on soft, slow playing and   libraries of just string runs or percussion releases of a single   percussive instrument. Given the high initial outlay for creating new   products and the fact that many potential buyers will already own a lot   of high-quality libraries, such niche products seem to be a  particularly  attractive move for developers.</p>
<p><strong>Download Delivery</strong></p>
<p>In conjunction with small, focused products we have seen an   increase in vendors offering download versions of their products. In   some cases there are only download versions. In 2010, some surprisingly   large libraries have also been offered as download-only. Given the   removal of packaging/shipping costs and the fact that (like many   composers) I may suddenly need to buy a library at 2am on Sunday,   downloads are very attractive to most customers&#8230; and do I really need   to mention the instant gratification when impulse buying shiny new   libraries?</p>
<p><strong>Light Version of Libraries</strong><br />
While some vendors have offered stripped-down versions of their   libraries in the past, 2010 saw a number of &#8216;light&#8217; versions of major   libraries with clearly explained upgrade paths. In such economically   trying times, this has been a wise idea allowing consumers to buy-in   cheaply without feeling that they&#8217;re wasting their cash. In certain   cases, the reduced system demands of the light libraries have made them   particularly desirable as alternatives to the full version.</p>
<p><strong>The Return of Algorithmic Reverb</strong><br />
While many have never stopped loving <em>algorithmic</em> reverb, I think  most will agree that <em>convolution</em> has been the darling for the last  couple of years. In 2010,  algorithmic reverbs came back big-time. The  big news was that Lexicon  finally released a software plugin of their  highly esteemed <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lexiconpro.com/product.php?id=163" target="_blank">PCM hardware reverbs</a> (I then bought a PCM 90 at a great  price on eBay!). New versions of  the popular reverb continued to  improve on their fantastic sound. The  fantastic <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.liquidsonics.com/software_reverberate.htm" target="_blank">Reverberate</a> plug-in  combined convolution with some algorithmic reverb qualities and the word  is that the next version of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.audioease.com/Pages/Altiverb/AltiverbMain.html" target="_blank">Altiverb</a> (unfortunately not released in  2010) will also feature more of a hybrid convolution/algorithmic design.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s Next?</strong><br />
Considering the current state of the industry, with budgets and   schedules being forever squeezed, 2010 must have been a tough year to be   a sample developer. Personally, I feel that most have responded in an   incredibly positive and ingenious manner, continuing to produce   game-changing offerings and providing amazing deals to customers. With   the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.namm.org/thenammshow/2011" target="_blank">Winter NAMM Show</a> happening this week in the USA, I guess it&#8217;s time to make some  incredibly inaccurate  predictions! Nonetheless, here are a few things  I&#8217;m hoping for in 2011:</p>
<ul>
<li>EastWest/Quantum Leap to release a brass library to compliment <em>Hollywood Strings</em></li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.spitfireaudio.com/wordpress/" target="_blank">Spitfire</a> to release more commercial libraries</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.spectrasonics.net/" target="_blank">Spectrasonics</a> (who were suspiciously quiet in 2010) to wow us all again with&#8230; something (?)</li>
<li>64-bit <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.steinberg.net/en/products/cubase/start.html" target="_blank">Cubase</a> on Mac</li>
<li>Further developments in the style of Cinesamples&#8217; <em>CineOrch</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
Of course this is all only my viewpoint here. I did buy a  lot of sample  libraries in 2010 but not all of them, and I didn&#8217;t want to  make any  direct comparisons when I only own two of the three big string libraries  or one of the two recent choir releases.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>What started out as an article about the role of assistants in the spotting process turned out to be a little more than that. I&#8217;ll cover some aspects of spotting from a composer assistant&#8217;s perspective, but you&#8217;ll find more of an overarching description about what assistants should and shouldn&#8217;t do overall in this particular column. End disclaimer.</p></blockquote>
<p>When you assist a composer, which I have spent the majority of my time in LA doing, it&#8217;s hard to get excited about the &#8220;spotting session&#8221;. It is only on Spotting Day that I know several things are about to take place for me: I&#8217;m going to be fetching a hell of a lot of coffee and I&#8217;m going to repeating the phrase, &#8220;Can I get you anything else?&#8221; a whole helluva lot, too.</p>
<p>Oh yes… as an assistant, Spotting Day is all about making people comfortable. You are responsible for setting up the room, getting the refreshments prepared and arranged, making sure the equipment is working properly, and a whole host of other boredom-inducing tasks that will literally make you wish upon a star that you were at home in your bathrobe… pulling your fingernails out one by one.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s if you aren&#8217;t paying attention.</p>
<p>If you are a learner, you will find your composer&#8217;s spotting sessions to be of great educational value now as the assistant, but especially later as you move on to develop your own business and start to make inroads as an independent composer. The things I&#8217;ve learned while watching my composers (and their teams) spot films are some of the best lessons in cinema one could ever ask for. You&#8217;ve undoubtedly heard it said many times, but &#8220;there&#8217;s nothing better than being there&#8221;.</p>
<h1>Gatekeeper</h1>
<p>When I&#8217;ve sat in on spotting sessions, my job has been to be the <em>gatekeeper</em> for my composer. If the spotting session is happening at the composer&#8217;s studio, it is very important that there is someone who is running interference by eliminating any and all unnecessary distractions. For the composer, keeping everyone&#8217;s focus on the task of agreeing on the places where the music will go is the most important part of the process at this juncture and will set up the way that this project will go from here on. If the director is uncomfortable in his chair, the editor is looking around for something cold to drink, and the music editor is worried that his parking meter is going to run over out on the street in front of the studio, then your composer is the only one truly watching to see where music should go, and that, as we know, is a recipe for disaster. Not because a composer couldn&#8217;t spot the thing himself, but only because we&#8217;ve all been in the place where the composer decides where a musical statement should be only to have the director change it all at the last minute. Had he not been distracted at the session, chances are slimmer that a change would need to be made later.</p>
<p>If you assist, this is the time when you are going to want to try and anticipate when and where people are going to feel like they need to take their attention off of the spotting and put it onto something else entirely. The absolute focus of the director, editor, composer, sound designer, and music editor is key in this process or mistakes will be made. You must do everything you can do to keep the attention on the film. I used to keep a roll of quarters in my desk at a studio I worked at for while so that I could go feed parking meters and make sure that when the director came out to get his car, it wasn&#8217;t sitting on the bed of a tow truck. These are the kind of things that you are supposed to be thinking about when you assist a composer during a spotting session.</p>
<h1>Environmental Inspector</h1>
<p><strong></strong>Another part of your job as an assistant during a spotting session is to anticipate and correct technical errors. Is the picture not showing up? Is there audio coming out of the speakers? What is that hum that you are hearing? I promise you, when you get a room full of important people together to watch a movie and your composer is feeling the stress of the meeting, anything that can go wrong WILL go wrong! It&#8217;s Murphy&#8217;s Law. Make sure that you fully test everything prior to the spotting session. There is nothing more embarrassing, for you or your composer, than to have people sitting there ready work without the ability to do so simply because nobody checked the cable connections or the picture before the session started.</p>
<p>In my experience, it has been the simplest things that have ruined entire spotting sessions. One time, I was working as an intern at a studio in Santa Monica. The guy who was actually assisting the composer at this spotting session had plugged in a power strip to wire everything up with. As the attendees took their seats, I could not help but notice from the back of the room that the cord for that power strip was left running out into the middle of the room, in perfect placement for someone to come along and trip on it. I mentioned it to the assistant, and he casually brushed me off and told me not to worry about it. Sure enough, about 30 minutes into the film, the director called a break and asked the composer where the restroom was. He headed off in that direction, turning back quickly to look for his cell phone. As he whirled around to head again to the restroom, he tripped over that cable and almost ate it headfirst into a glass coffee table. Very embarrassed and also visibly upset, the director stumbled into the hallway and down towards the restroom.</p>
<p>What returned was a very pissed off and annoyed director monster. From that moment on, he didn&#8217;t like a single idea the composer came up with, and actually begun to side very publicly with the film&#8217;s editor on almost all music placement decisions.</p>
<p>You never know what is going to change the vibe in the room. It could be an idea that is not given credence, a chair that the someone finds uncomfortable, the soda that is being supplied is not what anybody likes to drink, or someone leaves a cord plugged in where people can easily trip and fall.</p>
<p>The lesson here is to make sure that people are positioned in such a manner that all ideas presented can be heard and discussed without physical discomfort, provide comfortable seating, make a phone call to the director&#8217;s assistant and find out what he/she likes to drink, and run cables where people can&#8217;t get hurt.</p>
<p>Pretty simple.</p>
<h1>Welcome Wagoneer</h1>
<p><strong></strong>On the first film I worked on as SCOREcast founder Deane Ogden&#8217;s assistant, we were prepping for a simple spotting session at Deane&#8217;s studio with the director, the editor, and the executive producer. As conversation pieces, Deane keeps a lot of gadgets and goofy toys in his studio—things like Slinkies, PEZ dispensers, and miniature rock gardens. Throughout the spotting session, the director of that film kept fiddling with the Maharajah PEZ dispenser that Deane keeps on the upper tier of his workstation desk. Deane and the director disagreed many times during the spotting session, and decided to table a few particular places until Deane had a chance to really go through the film a few times and play with themes. But all the while, the director kept monkeying around with that PEZ dispenser, flipping its head back and forth and holding onto it for all dear life, as if it gave him some sense of security that everything would be okay&#8230; if we could just get through this spotting session! Once or twice, I caught Deane&#8217;s eye and we both silently acknowledged that we noticed the directors fascination with the toy.</p>
<p>After the spotting session was over, Deane had me make a call over to the director&#8217;s office at the production company and find out what their mailing address was.</p>
<p>Two days later, Deane received an elated call from the director saying what a wonderful surprise it was to open a package in his office to find that PEZ dispenser wrapped up with a card. After that day, Deane and that director saw eye to eye on virtually every other issue that came up during the scoring of that film, and the process of delivery was flawless and event-free.</p>
<p>As an assistant, you are the musical equivalent to the town Welcome Wagon. You can be a good assistant by just showing up everyday and doing your job—humping cable, cutting demos, installing software—or you can be a <em>great</em> assistant by noticing the things that might make your composer&#8217;s relationship with his/her director better and more relaxed.</p>
<p>Do some research and find out about what the people in your room are into. Do they like a certain band or artist? Send them an iTunes gift card before the spotting session. It really doesn&#8217;t matter what it is, just as long as it is something that you know they will really be in love with. Sending them something non-personal will have the opposite affect and will not make them feel welcomed into your composer&#8217;s circle of trust. Also, you don&#8217;t need to send a gift. That is simply only one example of something my composer did at one time that happened to work in our favor. You might want to just familiarize yourself with anything that these people have been involved in recently so that you can make conversation with them on common ground. You could apply this tip to any point in time with one of your principals. It doesn&#8217;t just pertain to spotting time.</p>
<p>These are just three of the little things I try to do as an assistant for my composers in or around the time we are spotting a film. To all of you assistants out there who have better and more specific ideas as to how we can better prepare our composers for a winning spot, <strong>COMMENTS</strong> are open.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seems like there are a lot of ways to spend your money these days, often more money than may be coming in. What are the right choices to move your career forward? Here are a couple of contrasting ideas, both worth considering in their own context.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">More bits</span><br />
To start with, here I am wearing my &#8220;technical guru&#8221; hat. Let&#8217;s review some things about digital and computer audio; there&#8217;s a new technical trend and product you should be aware of.</p>
<p>You probably know that digital audio, in the files we create and the way in the signals can flow from one piece of equipment to another, can be in a variety of different sample rates (44.1KHz, 48KHz, etc.) and word lengths (usually 24-bit for most professional applications). (If you need a refresher, check my article &#8220;<a href="../../../2009/09/technical-guidelines-for-film-and-tv.html">Technical Guidelines for Film and TV Scoring — Part 1</a>&#8220;.) Recently there has been a lot of talk about &#8220;32-bit&#8221; and &#8220;64-bit&#8221; — how does that fit into all of this?</p>
<p>The new Apple Mac Pro computers with Intel Core2 Duo processors and the newest operating system, 10.6 (Snow Leopard) are said to be 64-bit capable. Do they sound even better? No, not necessarily. 32-bit and 64-bit don&#8217;t have anything to do with digital audio formatting or fidelity. What this is all about is the ability of any individual software app to access on-board RAM memory.</p>
<p>With 32-bit capability, which is how things have been up until now, an app such as our familiar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstations_%28DAW%29">DAW</a> hosts Digital Performer, Logic, etc., can have a current working file size of up to 4 gigabytes. This includes the amount of memory that is needed for plug-in soft synths, many of which are getting to be pretty substantial memory hogs. This would include, but not limited to, such popular products as Omnisphere, Trillian, Ivory, and the various orchestral library sample players. Maybe you&#8217;ve noticed, by the time you get a few of those instantiated, your DAW becomes logy, slower and less responsive, maybe crashy. It&#8217;s not just processor power, it&#8217;s memory handling.</p>
<p>When clients ask me about buying a computer, a common question is how much RAM memory to equip it with? The computers can hold more and more, but if the DAW can only be filled up to 4 GB then the practical guidelines have been maybe 8 GB total. But that&#8217;s not the case anymore; on a new machine I would recommend 16 GB or more — I think very shortly you are going to be able to put that to good use.</p>
<p>In order to run more soft synths, there have been work-arounds that some composers have used. A common and practical one is <a href="http://www.plogue.com/?cat=4">Plogue Bidule</a>. This app runs in the background along with your DAW, talks to it (sound and MIDI) via <a href="http://www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/index.cfm?fuseaction=get_article&amp;article=rewire">ReWire</a>, and can act as host for plug-in soft synths in a variety of formats. The instruments connect to and can be programmed in your DAW software but are not limited by how much memory an individual app can access, at least up to the 4 GB limit. So effectively you can double your capacity, with some soft synths in your DAW and some in Plogue.</p>
<p>But now we are entering the era of 64-bit memory accessing, so this limitation is going to go away. With 64-bit, a processor can address up to 16 exabytes of memory (that&#8217;s over 16 billion gigabytes)! Now the DAWs, sample players, and other apps have to be re-written in order to take advantage of this. Some already have: Logic 9.1 is 64-bit ready, and (some) SpectraSonics synths. Others can be expected to join the party certainly within the next year or so.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there is another &#8220;background&#8221;-type host which looks to be an even better bet than Plogue: <a href="http://vsl.co.at/en/65/71/1738/1356.vsl">Vienna Ensemble Pro</a>. This was built for their excellent Vienna Orchestra sample sets, but can work with other brand plug-ins as well, and the advantage is that it comes with both 32-bit and 64-bit versions — you can run both at the same time, hosting whichever format your individual sample instruments might support. Composer <a href="http://www.joelgoodman.com/">Joel Goodman</a>, recently installed these and reports that his performance with Digital Performer 7.1 has been generally smooth and trouble free (well … we are talking software here!). (Special thanks to Joel who brought me up to speed on this stuff.)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">More people</span><br />
Now let&#8217;s talk about something that will make your music even more exciting than the best software instruments, I promise.</p>
<p>How many of you would be willing to take your entire fee from a gig, maybe even several gigs, and invest it in the newest greatest computer software or hardware upgrade? &#8220;Yeah, I can see that, it keeps getting better and you gotta keep up, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, how many of you would be willing to take that same pile of money and invest it in a room full of expert studio musicians, for one day? Or maybe just a few of them?</p>
<p>Not so easy, is it? &#8220;My clients don&#8217;t really care. There&#8217;s no budget for it, or time. I&#8217;m barely making ends meet as it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve observed something from my engineer&#8217;s chair: Everybody&#8217;s got about the same computer tools, and you need them of course. But the typical one-man band-in-a-box score is a pretty good way to get more of the same kind of work you already have, but not necessarily to move a career forward.</p>
<p>A couple of examples come to mind: most people are familiar with the composer Michael Giacchino. A couple of years ago at the SCL annual meeting, he told the story of his big break, when he insisted on using a live orchestra to score a video game. Now of course that&#8217;s not uncommon — thank you Michael! I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll ever reach for Omnisphere when he wants to pull someone&#8217;s heartstrings.</p>
<p>Or, closer to my home: composer <a href="http://www.miriamcutler.com/">Miriam Cutler</a>, whose documentary scores always feature as many live warm human beings playing instruments as she can possibly squeeze in. Often they are recorded one at a time, in her personal studio, and sometimes layered with electronic textures as well, but the net effect is an organic and emotional sound that keeps her in demand in her chosen genre. I know she&#8217;ll agree that insisting on live musicians is a big part of what gives her music the magic that clients notice.</p>
<p>Think about it: when you add even one more expert player to your mix, you are doubling the intellectual and creative firepower. And in a city like Los Angeles, there is an incredible wealth of experienced players who have &#8220;been there and done that&#8221; over and over. They bring not only the ability to play a part in tune and expressively, but help solve dramatic problems, improvise in just the right way for the emotion of a scene, or give an immediate sonic spark that you&#8217;d never get out of East-West Quantum Leap even if you worked all night.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not in Southern California (or just want to stay off the freeway), ask me and I can refer you to amazing musicians with personal studios and high-speed Internet who can work with you anywhere in the world — guitarists in every style from metal to ethnic world sounds, woodwinds and brass players, harp, bass, a pianist with an amazing Bösendorfer piano, some percussionists, fiddle and other strings, kick-ass drummers, even a pretty good mixing engineer <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . All with experience in major motion picture and television scores.</p>
<p>I have to admit, I&#8217;m not a composer and I don&#8217;t write the checks. Maybe yet another episode of a reality series is not the time to suddenly splurge on a bunch of live guys (although check out &#8220;Lost&#8221;); if so then what about the next big pitch demo? You will have to find the right time and place, but I strongly believe it&#8217;s worthwhile.</p>
<p>What do you think? I&#8217;d be very interested to have composers weigh in with comments about when and if you have worked with expert live players (no matter where you are located), and what your experience was.</p>
<p>Who is your secret weapon (don&#8217;t worry we won&#8217;t tell), player or players that you couldn&#8217;t do a score without? Did you ever try live musicians and then regret it? Did you ever work with a musician who gave you fantastic results that you never would have expected? Did you learn something? Did your clients (or demo targets) care, or notice? Did you get the gig? Would you do it again?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve had this experience: you go to a party, a meeting or seminar, or maybe just an informal gathering of people — friends, work colleagues, folks out in the world. Inevitably there is one person there who stands out, the center of attention, clearly the most confident, smartest, most successful. How did this person get to be that way? Blessed with talent, charisma, and brains, they go through life winning every game they play&#8230; it seems.</p>
<p>If you are one of those people, congratulations. But what about the rest of us? How can we hope to compete and succeed in their world, maybe even become a bit like that someday? Let&#8217;s take a look at a few charismatic successful people I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of meeting and working with over the years, and then talk a bit about what we can learn from them.</p>
<p>The first composer I ever worked with in major network TV show scores was Stewart Levin (30-Something, Picket Fences). Before moving into composing, he played keyboards for Dionne Warwick and other entertainers, and so is comfortable around &#8220;stars&#8221;. Besides being a terrific musician and composer, I was always impressed with how at ease he seemed to be with show producers Ed Zwick, Marshall Herscowitz, and David Kelly — besides music and film, he could talk with them about other things they were interested in, hobbies, families, cars, and so forth. He&#8217;s a charmer who always has a joke to tell to break the ice.</p>
<p>Nelson Kole is a bundle of talent, energy, and fun. Is it his New York roots that make his mind go faster than most people I know? He has had music bursting out of him since an early age, particularly in the world of musical theater; he tells of organizing his high school plays as arranger and music director, and this past year he arranged and coached a dance number for Beyoncé and Hugh Jackman in the Academy Awards telecast. One can learn a lot from watching the way he works with a performer, making sure everything is perfect for their individual abilities — song key, range and pacing, and attention to what they can do best and what they might need help with, always with a smile.</p>
<p>Dan Foliart is one of the most experienced and successful television composers (Secret Life of the American Teenager, Home Improvement, the list goes on and on). Much has been written about his shows and scores, but I&#8217;d like to mention his dedication to being a leader and mentor for composers. As president of the Society of Composers and Lyricists, he has done much to defend the art and business of score music, to shine a light on successful composers and encourage up-and-coming ones, and to provide a sense of community in what is often a solitary profession. In a crowd people gather around him, but he always generously takes the opportunity to introduce folks to each other, and say something positive about each one.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth mentioning the <a href="http://www.thescl.com/site/scl/">Society of Composers and Lyricists</a> with a bit more attention. If you are in the Los Angeles or New York area, I can&#8217;t recommend this organization highly enough. It&#8217;s a resource for composers, lyricists, as well as support professionals such as orchestrators, instrumentalists, mixers and engineers such as myself, even agents and attorneys. Will being a member get you a composing job? Maybe not directly (although perhaps as an assistant), but frequent seminar meetings have included topics such as getting the job, working with directors, musicians, engineers, editors, and software, and even effective networking techniques.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, one more name worth mentioning is Dan Kimpel. I met Dan in an SCL seminar on networking. He is absolutely a powerhouse expert in all things &#8220;getting the gig&#8221; through effective interaction with all kinds of folks who can help move your career forward. He is a guy who is absolutely overflowing with a million terrific techniques and ideas on how to get yourself noticed in this business in a positive way.</p>
<p>Dan Kimpel has written an excellent book on the subject, which is a &#8220;must read&#8221; for all: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Networking-Strategies-Music-Business-Book/dp/1592007538/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1264028744&amp;sr=1-5">Networking Strategies for the New Music Business</a> (You may have noticed, I think books are important.) He tells, with far more authority and detail than I could, the right (and wrong) ways to hone the connection skills that are so important in this business.</p>
<p>What can we learn from these bright guys? Clearly it&#8217;s important to perfect your chops as a musician, but social skills and interaction play a big part as well. Being at ease around other people comes naturally to some; for others of us it takes practice. One key tip I have learned is that &#8220;to be interesting to others, you must be interested in others&#8221;. Stewart, Nelson, and both Dans have in common that they are truly interested in and engaged by the people they come in contact with. You can tell they have a passion for what they are doing, and the people they are doing it with.</p>
<p>You might say, &#8220;Self-confidence comes easy for those who are successful. But what if I&#8217;m not yet at that point?&#8221; But almost everybody has had success in at least something. You don&#8217;t start out the climb at the top of the mountain. Think about what you have learned so far, and of course never stop looking for more ways to learn, grow, and practice.</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t forget, find a way to be a bright light to at least someone in the world. You probably already are.</p>

Put together with the help of legendary film scoring engineer Shawn Murphy, Hollywood Strings has been billed over the last several months by EastWest as the &#8220;a must have compositional tool for serious composers&#8221;.</p>
<p>As the public date of release approached, however, EW continued to slide the release schedule ever later, resulting in what appeared to be several missed internal deadlines.</p>
<p>The wait is finally over. Sort of.</p>
<p>While the library still does not ship for <i>another month</i>, you can catch a glimpse of Hollywood Strings running on the PLAY Engine in this <a href="http://www.soundsonline.com/hollywood-strings">short video</a> posted this morning to EW&#8217;s website.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[In keeping with this month&#8217;s theme of “Gear and Software”, I wanted to talk a little more about my number 1 &#8220;My Perfect 3&#8221; find: The Universal Audio UAD2 DSP Card.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="MsoNormal"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sig-knaub1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-586" title="sig-knaub" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sig-knaub1.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>In keeping with this month&#8217;s theme of “Gear and Software”, I wanted to talk a little more about my number 1 &#8220;My Perfect 3&#8221; find: The Universal Audio UAD2 DSP Card.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">DSP cards for use in DAW’s have been around for a while now, predominantly starting with Digidesign and ProTools, then later came the UAD-1 card from Universal Audio and TC Electronics released the Powercore card around the same time. The Digidesign DSP cards used a proprietary TDM architecture that ran only in ProTools hardware and software. For the rest of us who did not have a spare 10-15K lying around to get into ProTools, we were left out.<br />
<a name="more"></a>When Universal Audio and TC Electronics released their native DAW versions of plugins that could run on their respective DSP cards, this definitely narrowed the gap and gave all levels of musicians and engineers the advantage of offloading plugins from the computers CPU to the DSP card to do the heavy lifting. Aside from the advantage of offloading the plugins to another DSP, the quality of the plugins has increased and the emulations of both vintage and current gear are nothing than stellar.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Universal Audio’s Analog emulation’s in my opinion are the best around. UA being the hardware manufacture of some of the best Analog hardware pieces on the planet did not hurt them in developing these plugins. Devices like the 1176LN compressor, the never forgettable Teletronix LA2A optical compressor, the LA3A, etc, are now available in multiple instance counts in your native DAW host of choice, Mac or PC, AU, VST and RTAS. (For more on Universal Audio’s history please check out their website: <a href="http://www.uaudio.com/about/history.html"><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">www.uaudio.com—history.html</span></a>)</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">The <a href="http://www.uaudio.com/products/uad/index.html">Universal Audio DSP</a> card (known as the UAD1) has been around for while and recently got an update in power capability (UAD2). This is one of the first third party DSP cards used to run plugins in native DAW hosts. Most people don’t know, but the original UAD1 card’s chip was actually a graphics chip, (GPU) that was used in some older computers motherboards. UA found a way to harness that DSP chip to run these plugins emulations in great quantity. They later released the ability to run up to 4 cards in a single machine or PCI chassis, significantly increase plugin counts.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Universal Audio originally started out with a limited set of plugins and now have ~50 of the <span style="font-family: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;;">world’s finest analog emulation plugins from Neve, Roland, BOSS, Empirical Labs, EMT, Fairchild, Harrison, Helios, Little Labs, Pultec, SPL, Teletronix and more.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">The latest versions of the UAD 2 card, comes in four versions. The UAD2 SOLO Laptop, UAD2 SOLO, the UAD2 DUO and the UAD2 QUAD. These new cards use the latest SHARC <span style="font-family: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;;">21369 </span>DSP technology from Analog Devices.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">The SOLO uses a single DSP chip, the DUO uses 2 DSP chips and the Quad as you can image uses 4 DSP chips.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">You can see from this <a href="http://www.uaudio.com/support/uad/charts.html">chart</a> the new UAD 2 significantly increases the plugins counts across the board. The UAD2 quad card for example has the power of 10 original UAD1 cards in a single PCIe card slot. Using the Neve 88RS channel strip plugin, a single UAD2 Quad card can have 140 mono instances running on the card. Imagine having the power of a 140 channel Neve console in your studio, with EQ, and compression.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">I currently use the UAD2 Quad card in my setup (2.8Ghz- 8 Core Mac Pro). The performance is incredible. I used to have 4 UAD-1 cards and was maxing them out for most of my mixes. Now with the UAD2 Quad card, I don’t even bother looking at plug counts. I just start applying the plugs that I use the most often to my audio and VI channels. As we don’t have time to review all of the plugins that are available on the UAD2 platform, I will list the top 10 that I use on a daily basis:</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="MsoNormal">1176LN</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">LA2A</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Neve 1073</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Pultec EQP-1A</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">EMT250</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Precision Limiter</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Fairchild 670</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">LA3A</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Neve 88RS</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Neve 33609</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="MsoNormal">The technology that we have access to today is sometimes so incredible that we simply take it for granted. In the old school days (my time <span style="font-family: Wingdings;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">J</span></span>), you did not have the ability to use 10 1176LN compressors in your mix. You only had one or two in the whole studio. These DSP cards and more importantly the plugins have given us access to some of the best analog gear made in digital form. I still stand by the less is more rule when it comes to using plugins, and the rule of garbage in garbage out still applies. Spend more time on getting a great sound prior to recording, and then use the plugins as you would a spice. I’ll have a little dash of salt please.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">I can highly recommend all of the plugins from Universal Audio. The have bundles so you can just purchase a specific vendor or category of plugins. Your mileage may vary but you will not go wrong using any of these wonderful sounding plugins.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Until next month,</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Merry Christmas</div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sig-brockmann.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-590" title="sig-brockmann" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sig-brockmann.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>The first hint was not being sure what was up with my bottom end. Not the one in the chair, the one in the speakers.</p>
<p>I know, I&#8217;ve been there. In the chair, in front of the speakers. Spent a good part of my life there. I should know. I&#8217;m a mixer. (Sorry, went into Dragnet mode there!)<br />
<a name="more"></a>With keyboard, screen, mix controller in front of me,  and speakers outside of and behind the computer screen in a nice equilateral triangle with my head and ears, the mix is coming together pretty nicely. Got the harps and guitars panned and strings nicely textured with a good convolution reverb. But now — what about the bass? Why do the notes sound uneven, some booming and some receding? And why does the whole thing sound so much different on my other good living room speakers?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Non-gear</span><br />
So here we are, it&#8217;s December on SCOREcast, and the topic of the month is Gear and Software. I&#8217;m not always a contrarian, but I am going to be one right now. Everyone might like to hear what I have to say about the latest microphones, preamps, and software plugins, and I have plenty of ideas about those. But almost every musician I have worked with saves up his or her money and then invests in all kinds of screens, knobs, cables and boxes, but almost nobody has given any investment or attention to the acoustics of the room they&#8217;re working in, and how that affects the sound. Does it matter? You bet. Let&#8217;s take a look.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Physics 101</span><br />
We all probably sat through this in school; many musicians get glazed eyes when anything with math in it is mentioned. But it&#8217;s pretty simple: start with the fact that sound travels in waves, ranging in length from about 56 feet at 20 Hz on up to 7/10 of an inch at 20K Hz. Right in the middle, at 500 cycles, it&#8217;s 2.3 feet. And whenever a sound wave encounters a hard surface, such as the wall behind my mixing position, it bounces off like a rubber ball. Those reflections can interact with the waves coming straight out of the speakers, and either boost or cancel certain frequencies.</p>
<p>Of course music is made up of a wide variety of frequencies blended together, so the net results are complex. But the bottom line is what you hear isn&#8217;t necessarily what you get. Maybe the low end of the sound is hard to control and decide on, perhaps midrange sounds such as voices or orchestral instruments lack focus or take more EQ than they should, maybe your speakers don&#8217;t have a good deep and detailed stereo image. Maybe your woodwind or acoustic guitar overdub sounds like it was recorded in a bedroom (guess what?—it was!). All of these are ways in which your surroundings can negatively impact what you hear.</p>
<p>Actually there are two main concepts in acoustics that need to be attended to: how the surroundings inside your studio affect the sound of your speakers and of acoustic instruments you may be trying to record (room treatment), and also the issue of controlling sounds that may come in from the outside, which you probably don&#8217;t want, or your sound going out to bother the neighbors, which is also probably not ideal (sound isolation).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Getting started</span><br />
So what can you do about it? The topic is not that complex, but I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s a bit much for just a short article on a web blog, so I&#8217;m going to turn this into a book review. I have briefly mentioned it before, but I can&#8217;t say enough good things about a simple and extremely well written book: &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Acoustic-Design-Home-Studio-Book/dp/159863285X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1260822830&amp;sr=1-1%20">Acoustic Design for the Home Studio</a>&#8221; by Mitch Gallagher. This paperback will set you back less than $20, and it could be the best investment you could make for such modest money.</p>
<p>Gallagher really understands today&#8217;s project studio scene. He&#8217;s not going to make you wish you could afford a million-dollar custom building job (although don&#8217;t we all?), but goes over theory in a clear way and then tells you how to evaluate your present situation, and come up with a plan to improve it. He recommends off-the-shelf acoustic products that are affordable, and tells you how to use them, and also goes into detail about how to use everyday stuff that you may already have to fix up your acoustics for no cost whatsoever, if that&#8217;s what you need to do.</p>
<p>My home studio is not perfect yet, but with the aid of Gallagher&#8217;s book, I can get started. I have learned how to use the equipment I have to test the frequency response in my workspace, and have found some good alternatives on how to deal with it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s tempting to go with a nice microphone preamp or a new PCI card system to support better plugins. But wouldn&#8217;t it feel good to be able to have the confidence that everything you record or mix and deliver sounds just the same everywhere it is played, just as you intended it to?</p>

Here are the three that Brian Satterwhite chose, and a short rundown on why he picked them.</em><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>I&#8217;m not trying to be different merely for the sake of being different, but the honest truth is, I&#8217;m not a huge gear-head. Yes, it&#8217;s true I have gear. I use it daily and rely on it heavily for my personal welfare and the advancement of my career. But for me, it is merely a means to an end. Under the right conditions, I would probably not think twice about abandoning most of my gear in order to escape the limitations it sometimes burdens me with. I&#8217;m not meaning to disparage technology. I just don&#8217;t have a stock answer for what I use that truly excites me and would be of benefit to those reading this.<br />
<a name="more"></a>I could list some of my favorite pieces of essential hardware like my BLUE Kickball mic or Apple computer, or some of my favorite software titles like Logic Pro, MachFive 2, or Finale, which I use daily, but I figure the majority of composers out there are already aware of these popular tools. In a profession dominated by technical gadgetry, I want to go old school and talk about three pieces of gear that are indispensable in helping me become the composer I&#8217;m striving to be while adding a bit of insight for those composers receptive to it.</p>
<p><strong>Piano</strong><br />
A gorgeous, well-tuned piano, is one of the most expressive, acrobatic, and versatile instruments ever invented. It translates to nearly every style of music imaginable and can fill the sonic spectrum with almost as much color as a symphonic orchestra. While the piano is certainly not new to film music, I feel its use has grown somewhat trite even though there is nothing inherent about this instrument that requires it to be so. Just ask yourself, has the piano been fully explored in film music (or any music for that matter). Are there roads left to travel which could reveal new perspectives of this magnificent instrument?</p>
<p>I scored a film earlier this year where I wrote a traditional piece of music in strict sonata form for piano and cello during several key developments in the narrative. I wrote these early in the scoring process and recorded them before finishing the entire score. The studio I used had a gorgeous Steinway piano that sung like a choir of angels each time my finger touched a key. After the cues were in the can, I fell so in love with this instrument that I wrote the entire finale of the film for three solo pianos! I returned to the studio a couple of weeks later and performed the primary part while overdubbing the second and third parts. The low costs involved in utilizing a world-class instrument in a creative way made this a very feasible approach which I aim to employ again in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Violin/Cello</strong><br />
Most composers (including me) strive to record their music with a symphony orchestra. Who can blame us? The orchestra is our &#8220;biggest box of crayons&#8221; and produces such a wonderfully vivid and magical array of sonic imagery. However it&#8217;s grotesquely expensive and not a realistic option for the majority of films I work on. This is true for many composers out there making a living off their music. A popular option for harnessing the power of a symphonic orchestra while simultaneously keeping within the limits of low-budget independent film production is to utilize powerful computer processing and samples to replicate a live orchestra. This is a fine approach, but for me when my budgets get low, I&#8217;d rather hire as many live players as I can afford rather than substitute them for sampled instruments from my computer. Even with a library of thousands upon thousands of sounds, I feel shackled creatively when compared to the immense freedom I enjoy composing for a live solo instrument.</p>
<p>The solo violin or solo cello is one such instrument I try to utilize at every appropriate opportunity. I&#8217;ll substitute for sampled instruments where I can but I&#8217;ll let the focus of the music rest on whatever live instrument I&#8217;ve employed.</p>
<p>While so many are aware of the advantages and prestige an orchestra brings to a score, it seems to me that an almost equal number has seemingly forgot that one solo instrument, composed with skill and an understanding of that instrument, can bring almost as much strength, emotion, imagery, and dignity to a score as a seventy-five piece ensemble.</p>
<p><strong>Harp (MachFive 2)</strong><br />
Ah-ha! Finally, some technology! If you listen to the film music I&#8217;ve composed over the last couple years of my career you&#8217;ll notice the harp dominates the majority of it. I love the harp! It&#8217;s a wonderful companion to the piano. Almost as versatile, almost as acrobatic, and every bit as beautiful as the piano, the harp creates colors not explored as often thus keeping it relatively fresh in the ears of the listener.</p>
<p>The one hitch is most of my harp usage is generated from a really fantastic sample library. Surprisingly enough, it&#8217;s the harp library that is included in MOTU&#8217;s universal sampler, MachFive 2. Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong, I would still rather hire a live harpist and will do so if I have the budget for it, but harp is one of those instruments with a harsh reality attached: a) harp players are relatively rare, and b) they&#8217;re expensive to hire both for their skills and for their excessive instrument cartage fees. This makes it a prime candidate for utilizing a library rather than a live musician.</p>
<p>My mixing engineer even developed a radical EQ setting for my harp library so whenever he gets tracks from me utilizing it, he knows to just lay in that EQ setting and start from there. It&#8217;s absolutely uncanny how realistic it sounds. A friend of mine, who is a Pulitzer Prize nominated composer, attended a film I scored last year. I utilized a mix of live players and sampled instruments and after learning the names of all my live musicians, my friend asked me who my harpist was. I told him, that was a sampled instrument. He was shocked!</p>
<p>Ya, it&#8217;s that good.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>There you have it! My overall message with this article is to keep in mind the power of the live musician even if it&#8217;s just a solo instrument. It&#8217;s very inexpensive and yet produces so much more compositional and creative freedom than even the largest sample libraries can&#8217;t provide. Thanks for reading and happy composing and listening to you all!</p>

Here are the three that Jim Well chose, and a short rundown on why he picked them.</em><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Reaper</strong><br />
In case you don&#8217;t know, <a href="http://www.reaper.fm/">REAPER</a> is a low-cost, high-function, constantly-improving digital audio workstation (DAW) program.  I&#8217;ve included REAPER in my top 3 not because I&#8217;m heavily using it myself (I&#8217;m not, so far), but because I feel it offers so much value for so little money that it&#8217;s simply not to be missed.<br />
<a name="more"></a>I&#8217;ve evaluated REAPER, found it to be excellent, and purchased a license.  A &#8220;discounted&#8221; license is only $60 even for commercial use, as long as your annual gross revenue is $20K or less;  above that level of revenue, you must purchase a &#8220;full&#8221; license for $225.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen REAPER in action, you&#8217;ll be shocked at how fast it starts up &#8212; almost instantly.  In a very simple interface, it incorporates most of what you&#8217;d expect in a DAW.  It runs under both Mac and Windows, 32-bit and 64-bit, comes with a very comprehensive library of REAPER-optimized plug-ins for manipulating audio and MIDI, and also supports VST, DX, and AU plug-ins.  For software-savvy users, there is also a software development kit (SDK) which makes it possible to add functionality to REAPER.  Finally, there are many extensions that allow you to do such things as combining the power of multiple computers, collaborating musically over the Internet, and integrating with other music applications.  For more, check out the website &#8212; and a very good book, <em>Reaper Power! The Comprehensive Guide</em> (ISBN 978-1-59863-879-0).</p>
<p><strong>WIVIs</strong><br />
The Wallander family of virtual instruments (<a href="http://www.wallanderinstruments.com/">WIVI</a>) is aimed primarily at composing for classical orchestra.  The majority of competing orchestral virtual instrument products are based on direct instrument waveform sampling technology and often involve huge and relatively inflexible sample libraries.  In place of fixed samples, WIVIs utilize a highly-parameterized instrument waveform model based on a technique similar to additive synthesis.  Most of these parameters can be varied continuously via MIDI, allowing nuances of playing technique far beyond what is typically possible with samples.  In addition, WIVIs utilize various types of randomization that not only can mimic variations characteristic of real playing but also counteract &#8220;phasing&#8221; effects that otherwise occur when virtual instruments are combined into ensembles.  WIVI plugins (VST, RTAS, and AU) take very little RAM or disk space and, for this reason, help complex projects to load extremely quickly in a DAW.  They run happily in either 32- or 64-bit environments under either Windows or Mac operating systems.  WIVIs are set up using a unique and powerful visual user interface that excels in both parametric flexibility and the ability to configure ensembles.</p>
<p>Current WIVIs include many types of flutes, oboes, bassoons, clarinets, saxophones, and brass instruments (muted as well as unmuted) and are sold in bundles, working out to an average cost of about $25 per instrument.  A comprehensive set of WIVIs costs about $1500-$1600, street price.  Additional WIVIs are believed to be in development.  Strings, however, are notably missing from Wallander&#8217;s offering and may or may not appear in the future.  Since I wrote about WIVIs in my July 15, 2009 SCOREcast column article, Wallander Instruments has released version 2.30, which makes many improvements to not only the WIVI interactive player but also to the sound and playability of all of the WIVI instruments.  Overall, I&#8217;m very enthusiastic about the expressiveness, creative possibilities, and sound quality WIVIs deliver and the degree to which they free me from many of the serious limitations of sample-based technology.  I just can&#8217;t say enough about them.</p>
<p><strong>LA Scoring Strings</strong><br />
Introduced in July, 2009, <a href="http://www.audiobro.com/">LA Scoring Strings</a> (LASS) is a sample-based string virtual instrument product that I think is representative of a trend toward increasing realism and playability in this sector of the composer&#8217;s arsenal.  An intense battle among several competitors in this product area is easy to understand given the central importance of strings in traditional orchestra.  For what it delivers, LASS is well worth the $1200 cost.  LASS is at once notable for its beautiful, expressive sound and for what it does to simplify creation of convincing MIDI mockups of divisi string passages.  LASS approaches divisi by offering, in effect, 5 separately-recorded sample libraries rolled into one:  first chair (solo), two different 1/4 divisi sections, a 1/2 divisi section, and a full section &#8212; for each of Violin 1, Violin 2, Viola, Cello, and Bass.  Samples from the different section types can be combined in any way desired, either to implement divisi or to create a full orchestra with maximum sonic diversity that maximizes the impression of realism.  LASS is also equipped with scripts (which run in the included Kontakt 3.5 playback engine environment) that make it relatively easy to orchestrate with samples of real legato, portamento, and glissando playing under MIDI control.  Additional scripts support trills, patterns of short articulations, tuning, and other features.  However, while LASS supports the string articulations one is most likely to need, some articulations, such as col legno, are not provided and may require you to combine LASS with another string library.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, considering it is a sample library, LASS uses a lot of RAM.  To take full advantage of its features, one is likely to need a 64-bit computer with the ability to address between 8 and 16 Gbytes of RAM, and even then you have to put up with long project load times.  Audiobro advises that you may also need to utilize two multi-core computers if handling complex orchestrations, though I been successful running LASS on a single 8-core Windows PC.  If you have this level of compute power, you&#8217;ll be amazed at what you can do.  If you don&#8217;t, there are various ways of working with lesser resources, but with increasing degrees of compromise and/or inconvenience.</p>

Here is an item that Les Brockmann chose, and a short rundown on why he picked it.</em></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Hey SCOREcasters!<strong> </strong>Okay here you go &#8211; &#8211; at least one if not three &#8211; &#8211;</p>
<p>All of our computers, software, and other digital gear are important to us. But of course they become obsolete relatively quickly and have to be replaced; I think of them as a monthly cost of doing business. On the other hand, high quality analog gear, just like a fine musical instrument, is an investment that can last you your whole career.</p>
<p><strong>Royer Microphones</strong><br />
I have gotten great usage from a couple of fantastic ribbon microphones, my matched pair of <a href="http://www.royerlabs.com/R-122V.html">Royer R-122V</a> mics. (a bit under $6K retail for the matched pair.) Ribbon mics are different from the <a class="zem_slink" title="Microphone" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone">condenser microphones</a> that many people are familiar with. They don&#8217;t have that bright crispness, but are often described as having a &#8220;warm&#8221; sound. They are wonderful on many orchestral instruments, particularly brass and woodwinds, piano, and sometimes strings. My Royers have a smooth top end, an extremely detailed midange, and robust bass.</p>
<p>What would I <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>not</em></span></strong> use them on? Vocals, probably, and definitely not on drums. Would I recommend them for the typical composer&#8217;s personal studio? Probably not, at least not as a first choice for someone who doesn&#8217;t have another mic. They are not so versatile that you would want to put them on everything, they need fussier microphone technique because they are figure-8 pattern as opposed to cardioid, and they are delicate and require careful handling.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly why I like to have them available. Everybody has (or should have) the standard hi-end condenser mics, and so it&#8217;s nice to be able to bring something unusual and special to a session. I knew I was onto something when, on a recent studio session featuring flute virtuoso Sheridan Stokes, the venerable LA contractor Joe Soldo told me, &#8220;I think that&#8217;s the most beautiful and natural sound I have ever heard from him!&#8221;</p>
<p>(Disclosure: I have read recently that, if you blog about a certain product, you should reveal if you have had any special treatment from that company. I have an &#8220;artist&#8221; relationship with Royer, which basically means I bought the mics direct from the company in exchange for them using my name and examples of my work in their advertising. My cost was approximately wholesale, definitely not free. And I was well aware of the quality of their mics before I agreed to this.)</p>

Here are the three that Lee Sanders chose, and a short rundown on why he picked them.</em><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Digital Performer</strong><br />
I imagine a lot of us will include our sequencing app on this list—and that&#8217;s probably appropriate. If you write music at the computer, your sequencing platform informs everything else you do. Its importance is paramount. It has to be solid, flexible, and powerful… and above all, it has to serve any need you might conceivably have in your composing life. Digital Performer delivers for me on all counts.</p>
<p>For me this application has, over the years, become a transparent filter. I&#8217;ve worked with it for thousands—tens of thousands—of hours, and my fingers just know where to go. If you&#8217;re a user of Logic, Cubase or any of the other major platforms out there, you may have the same feeling about your work canvas… at some point it&#8217;s just a matter of what you &#8220;grew up&#8221; using. For me, it&#8217;s Digital Performer—since 1989, when it was plain old Performer. For twenty years and counting, and I don&#8217;t see myself switching anytime soon.</p>
<p><strong>Omnisphere</strong><br />
On the other hand, Omnisphere is one of the newest additions to my arsenal, and it&#8217;s just a sick powerhouse of a sound module. The variety and sound quality of what you&#8217;ll find here is unparalleled, in my experience… and the playability and &#8220;inspiration&#8221; factor are downright dangerous. I&#8217;ve caught myself spending hours on end in enjoyable tone patrol, just seeing what this monster can do. And when you add the processing capabilities they&#8217;ve added onto this beast, the entire thing steps up yet another level. Seriously… it&#8217;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not nearly done scratching the surface of what Omnisphere will bring to my writing. I&#8217;d sum it up this way: sometimes you buy a new piece of gear because of its range: it does many things you need (or that you discover you need once you&#8217;ve made the purchase). Other gear you buy because it does one thing incredibly well. Omnisphere gives you both these functions… and that&#8217;s just plain wrong. Spectrasonics is a company of absolute lunatics for letting this thing go at the current price point. There. I said it.</p>
<p><strong>M-Audio keyboards</strong> (Keystation Pro 88 et al.)<br />
For me there are two camps of controllers: the Really Expensive, Really Nice Controller, and the Really Cheap, Readily Replaceable Controller. If you have true keyboard chops, you probably want to purchase the former and keep it around for a long, long time. The exquisite action of the hammers… the glorious reproduction of an actual piano &#8220;feel&#8221;… all these things make a difference to you.</p>
<p>Me, I&#8217;m a hack. I can play just well enough to enter the information in when I&#8217;m sequencing… and that&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s simply not a skill I&#8217;ve developed. Fully-weighted keyboards actually make my hands ache after a few hours of hard sequencing. So I buy a new, cheap, semi-weighted keyboard controller every year or two, and I just abuse that sucker. Inevitably it bites the dust, and I buy a new one. But that&#8217;s a strategy that works for me. And M-Audio offers lots of bells and whistles on their 88-key range (and I&#8217;d recommend 88 keys for you—if you haven&#8217;t worked with the full 88, you honestly don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re missing!), at a price that makes it possible for me to get by with my (lack of) performance technique. Problem… solution. Simple.</p>
<p>(P.S. I&#8217;d include my trusty Mac Pro on this list, but A) someone else is almost sure to do so, and B) Digital Performer is a Mac-only product, so I&#8217;m sort of able to cheat and include it by default—!)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/11/sig-brockmann.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-602" title="sig-brockmann" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/11/sig-brockmann.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>Recording and mixing music is a collection of skills that can take a lifetime to acquire. But almost every composer needs to do their own mixing sometimes, whether for a demo, low-budget project, or other reasons. The equipment keeps getting better and is widely available, especially with the computer software packages most composers work with. Let&#8217;s take a look at a few ideas and concepts about mixing music for the screen.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting up your studio</span><br />
First of all you need an appropriate place to listen and work. A deep discussion of room acoustics is too much for this article, but for a fantastic resource check out &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Acoustic-Design-Studio-Gallagher-Mitch/dp/159863285X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1258576292&amp;sr=1-1">Acoustic Design For The Home Studio</a>&#8221; by Mitch Gallagher. The physical layout and acoustics of the room that you are working in really do make a substantial difference in whether you can accurately hear what is in your mixes.</p>
<p>To start with, make sure your workstation and speakers are set in a good relation to each other. When you&#8217;re mixing, you will need to be directly facing the source of the sound, so your screen, keyboard and mouse, and mixing controller or console (if you have one) can&#8217;t be off to one side. Make sure your speakers are exactly at ear level when you&#8217;re sitting in your comfortable chair, and that your head and the two speakers form an equilateral triangle. A distance of four to five feet between the speakers and from each speaker to its corresponding ear is usually about right for a personal studio setup. Ergonomics are important; if your arms, hands, shoulders, or back hurt when you work you will never make it through the long career haul, so don&#8217;t scrimp on a crummy chair or an awkward reach.</p>
<p>The best way to learn what good mixing really sounds like is to sit right there and listen to a lot of recorded music from a variety of sources, including big-name film scores, as well as pop and classical music. Learn to think about tonal quality and balances; the mix is not the time to think about melody, orchestration, performance, or any other compositional or production details.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mix delivery</span><br />
When you are hired to do a score project, you will ultimately need to deliver the finished individual cues in a single mixed track or group of tracks, usually a computer file such as WAV or AIFF. Bear in mind it would never be right to deliver individual &#8220;raw&#8221; unmixed tracks — it is not the filmmaker&#8217;s job to mix your music on the final audio dub mix, just to balance it with all the other sound elements, dialog, effects, etc.</p>
<p>Occasionally you may be asked to separate out a melody track or some other part; this is called a &#8220;mix stem&#8221;.  The reason for this is, suppose in the final dub mix the filmmaker feels that a melody might be conflicting against a dialog line, for example. By having the melody on a separate track, this part can be turned down without having to turn down the entire cue. To prepare this, just make your mix as normal, and then record it twice (from the same start place): first all of the music but with the melody switched off, and then that melody track alone (including its reverb, etc.). When you listen to the two stems tracks together with equal levels it should sound just like you intended the mix. (For more about mix delivery, see my article &#8220;<a href="../../../2009/09/technical-guidelines-for-film-and-tv.html">Technical Guidelines for Film and TV Scoring — Part 1</a>&#8220;.)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mix chain plug-ins</span><br />
Recently I mixed a score for client in his studio computer, and afterwards he asked, why had I removed his &#8220;mastering plug-ins&#8221; from the master faders? He had previously done rough mixes, and his template included a compressor/limiter and an EQ. To start with, I had to explain what &#8220;mastering&#8221; means to an engineer:</p>
<p>Mastering is common in CD album work, and is a final processing step to make all the cuts on a CD sound consistent, and in particular, solve two problems. The first is that a contemporary album may have a number of different producers and engineers, and so the delivered mixes may vary widely in terms of level and EQ (top end/bottom end, etc.). A mastering engineer will use his tools to even things up and make every song match. However, a score mix is more likely to already be consistent in that respect (same engineer and the composer acting as producer).</p>
<p>The second task in CD mastering is level maximizing, using compression and limiting, in order to make the disc play loud and be &#8220;competitive&#8221; compared to other CDs. (This is usually demanded by record company people who don&#8217;t know much about good sound, or that good music can have dynamics.) Film score mixing is different in this respect — after the music is mixed and delivered then the film has its final &#8220;dub&#8221; sound mix in which all the sound elements are balanced. I guarantee, the music will NEVER be as loud as the dialog and effects. No matter how much you squash your music mix, that won&#8217;t have the slightest effect on making your music sound louder in the film soundtrack, or making your mix sound better balanced.</p>
<p>The filmmaker and the dubbing mixer make the choice of music volume. All pre-processing will get you is to hammer the life out of your music. Think of the dubbing mixer as your &#8220;mastering engineer&#8221;; he or she can make your music sound its best if you deliver good clean well-balanced mixes. (Tip:  If you do intend to use any mix chain plugins, make sure they are bypassed while you are making your mix, or you will be &#8220;chasing your tail&#8221;, with unintended consequences. And ALWAYS check your mixes with dialog.)</p>
<p>Also, be wary of pre-canned plug-in presets, both as &#8220;mastering chain&#8221; and in individual instrument channels. A few years back, there was a popular device called a Finalizer, the misuse of which (imho) did a lot to damage perfectly good mixes and deceive studio owners. It had a menu of presets for rock, classical, jazz, techno, etc., which called up a chain of compressors, limiters, and EQs already set to certain parameters. But think about it: is your Rock mix exactly like every other rock mix that anyone ever created?  Or, whatever style. The preset settings that might be appropriate for one example of a style are completely inappropriate for another example of similar style. There are simply too many variables that can go into production and mixing.</p>
<p>Plug-in presets are available in all the computer DAWs as well. For example, recent versions of Logic have these sorts of effect chains, in the &#8220;Library&#8221;. These are intended to take the mystery out of engineering for folks who don&#8217;t know much about it. But, watch out! Just like timing a scene or writing for the violin, there&#8217;s no excuse for not taking the time to really learn and understand how the tools of recording work, in order to get the most out of them.</p>
<p>In all the skills that go into creating great-sounding and competitive music, the more you know the better it will sound. And, best, your music will improve and you will know exactly why.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Across the film music industry, the recent composer unionization effort has been at the forefront of everyone&#8217;s mind for the last few weeks. Led by film composers Bruce Broughton, James DiPasquale, Alan Elliott, and Alf Clausen, the Teamsters Local 399 has offered a hand as one of the most powerful union organizations to help unionize composers — one of the last creative groups in Hollywood to still work without a collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>Since the announcement of this effort, there have been many opinions expressed, a lot of intense debate and discussion, and a load of mixed emotions on all fronts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="../../../2009/11/composer-unionization-more-questions.html">mentioned before</a> that I am yet undecided on the issue. To be honest, I&#8217;ve enjoyed the conversation and I&#8217;ve been soaking up everyone&#8217;s viewpoints on the subject. I&#8217;ve been an insatiable reader of online opinions on the union issue and have also done my own homework to be sure that when I decide which way is best for my own career, I can make an informed and thoughtful decision.</p>
<p>There is, however, a significant voice that is missing from the conversation — something that I&#8217;ve relied on all my life to aid me in my decision making process: <strong><em>The voice of leadership</em></strong>.</p>
<p>I know that in many careers, including my own, the whisper of seasoned leadership has been vital in helping to make informed decisions. Few influencers can sway a personal choice more than the experience and counsel of a seasoned veteran who has seen it all and done even more. The film music industry is chock full of veteran composers who have not only witnessed decades of change and transformation in our business (and adapted successfully to those changes), but have also been through the wars politically with directors, studios, agents, soundtrack labels, and yes&#8230; unions.</p>
<p>So where are they? Where are the voices of our Generals that we as the &#8220;foot soldiers&#8221; of the film music army have come to rely on for everything else that we&#8217;ve pondered career-wise — from what plug-ins to spend our money on to how to best break into the industry? Why are the &#8220;heavies&#8221; not weighing in publicly on an issue that could potentially be the most important critical argument toward the sustenance of our beloved craft to come down the pike in twenty years?</p>
<p>If you were in attendance at the Teamsters information meeting that took place on November 16, it was obvious that the majority of composers coming out to represent the community as a consensus were extremely young. While there were a handful of what most would call &#8220;A-List&#8221; veteran composers in the audience, most folks in the seats were either emerging or beginning composers well under the age of 40. Arguably, accessible technology combined with an over-saturation of scorable media has provided the impetus for a formerly older gentleman&#8217;s game to give way to a trade more available to younger men and women over the course of the last ten years or so.</p>
<p>To me, a severe irony exists in the absence so-far of vocalized opinion or comment from any recognized composer. For a group of people traditionally known to be somewhat introverted, to witness a gathering of over 450 of us in one room is a little of an accomplishment. To see five or ten of our more respected and recognized composers in attendance is also a surprise, again, given the way in which we composers don&#8217;t like to &#8220;come out of the cave&#8221;. But to some, this was important enough to attend, consequences be damned (and I&#8217;m sure there *were* some the next day!).</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to hear from those people. I&#8217;d like them to speak up and address us <em>foot soldiers</em>, whom, make no mistake, will be the initial base on which this proposed union will be built. After all, there is much more responsibility to being a composer than simply writing great music. There <em>is</em> a community at stake. A community that they are not only a part of, but certainly helped build. A community of young composers that is proud of their leaders&#8217; accomplishments, but also looks up to them for their experience, wisdom, and candor in speaking of the craft. They had me at their music, but Messrs. Broughton, Clausen, and DiPasquale have all stepped up to the plate and swung the bat to start a conversation, earning them even more respect and admiration from me. This is exactly the kind of leadership I am talking about. Now it is time for the rest of our legacy composers to step out of the shadows of Hollywood politics and shed some light on both sides of the union argument for the betterment of the community and the craft.</p>
<p>Here is why I believe this is necessary:</p>
<p>As much as the newer, younger generations of composers are gung-ho and ready to tackle the pros and cons of unionization, I am certain — as it is simply a byproduct of the human condition — that lack of experience, limited perspective, and the simple awkwardness of youth <em>will</em> have a negative affect on how smooth a ride this could be. I saw it at the meeting on the 16th, and we&#8217;ve all seen it in hundreds of other life experiences. For those of you that are familiar, the story of the &#8220;old bull and the young bull&#8221; comes to mind.</p>
<p>The harsh reality is that the majority of film composers have never worked within the motion picture studio system. The argument that studios are controlling less and less of the movie business as days go by is an argument that, factually, does not hold water, which is why you often hear veteran composers counseling beginners to &#8220;move to Los Angeles&#8221;. True, there are independent productions that have seen great success in the last fifteen years, but the majority of work in film that can sustain the career of a working film composer still originates at the Hollywood studio level. Even with the iron-clad film music education that a first rate university can provide these days, young composers are simply not adequately prepared to deal with the needs and desires of a major Hollywood studio from a business standpoint. The art of handling the nuances of multi-million dollar studio music budgets is not something that can be easily learned in a classroom setting, nor would a studio saddle a first time composer with such an unfair expectation.</p>
<p>I would suggest that the majority of composers in the room on November 16th haven&#8217;t the foggiest clue what a collaboration with a major studio feels, looks, or tastes like. They have never had to work up a package deal to be approved by a music department, nor have they ever encountered the prickly situation of a director requesting the production and orchestral recording of alternate cues that were not included on the package agreement to begin with. Beginning composers simply do not have the perspective necessary to see anything from the studio&#8217;s vantage point, and to put it plainly&#8230; many won&#8217;t for some time. Even the most experienced independent composers have yet to walk the tightrope of artistic integrity and serving the needs of a major studio&#8217;s budgetary guidelines and business parameters — both of which require careful attention in order to bring about a fruitful collaboration at the blockbuster level.</p>
<p>Anyone who now works or has worked with a studio will tell you that the unionization of composers poses far greater ramifications for both sides than it does at the independent level. At the studio level — which is where most of us would like to be, don&#8217;t forget — unionization poses a wholly different set of hurdles and obstacles, and means a lot more than just whether or not composers &#8220;get the respect&#8221; we deserve. In fact, I would bet my next royalty check that most studio-level composers didn&#8217;t attend last week&#8217;s meeting simply because it would have been a waste of their time. The fact is that the problems that haunt &#8220;A-List&#8221; composers are a far cry from the issues that haunt beginners. The day-to-day issues of studio-level composing under a composers union are those that would ripple the pond in far greater and potentially more dangerous ways than a beginning composer could ever pretend to imagine.</p>
<p>This is precisely why we need more recognized composers speaking out on the issue of a potential composers union. The silence of wisdom and experience serves to only make the natives more and more restless. Of course, there could be good reason for silence from A-listers, the first being the importance of maintaining alliances with the studios. Even still, there are ways to speak on this issue without jeopardizing business relationships, and it seems to me like many of those A-list composer/studio relationships are now galvanized to the point where not much damage could be done by simply sharing a healthy conversation.</p>
<p>I would like to openly invite any recognized composer to weigh in on the issue of unionization here at SCOREcastOnline.com. Please feel free to log into the COMMENTS below and voice your opinions, address any issues you feel are ambiguous on either side of the argument, or simply encourage the younger set out there to get more involved in the exploration of the possibilities. Just knowing that you all are engaged would help those of who want to be engaged feel a lot better about&#8230; well&#8230; engaging.</p>
<p>Your music has helped move us all through some of life&#8217;s most difficult challenges. That music came from your own filtered perspective on your lives and success. Now, more than ever, we need unfiltered access to that life experience to help move us through an issue that will most certainly effect all of us one way or another.</p>
<p>We anxiously await your response.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/10/sig-brockmann.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-618" title="sig-brockmann" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/10/sig-brockmann.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>I started out by scratching my head a bit, considering the topic of Collaboration. After all, there&#8217;s often only one engineer in the room, particularly in composer&#8217;s personal studio. But then, I figured, even in that case I&#8217;m certainly not working alone or in a vacuum. It&#8217;s almost impossible not to work with other people in this business, and who would want to? Here are some ways in which a score mixer collaborates with others.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> The Scoring Stage</span><br />
When called on to work in a commercial studio or scoring stage I almost always work as a member of a team. As an independent free-lancer, I am hired by the composer, and am the designated &#8220;team leader&#8221;; I&#8217;m in charge of the composer&#8217;s technical needs and interfacing with the staff of the studio.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t do it without helpers, almost always provided by the stage or studio: setup personnel, an assistant engineer, most likely a recordist/Pro Tools operator. When those guys have their act together, it can really help the session go &#8220;like butter&#8221;, and a smooth technical experience in the studio is essential to success for the date. Everything has to be planned out in advance, set up perfectly, tested before the downbeat, and there can be no delays for technical problems. The best studios and stages earn their reputation for excellence by providing staff personnel who are uncompromising experts at this.</p>
<p>I also have my &#8220;horror story&#8221; list of studios where this kind of thing didn&#8217;t happen, where not to go back. In the ideal world of projects with nice big budgets, we would always record at top-notch places like Capitol or the studio stages, but that&#8217;s not always the case. A part of what I have to offer in helping composers record is my career-long experience in the various studios around LA, what they can do technically and, most importantly, whether their staff &#8220;gets it&#8221; and understands the world of scoring. Not all of them do. A few years back, on a low-budget film project, we booked a large room over in Burbank for a day of string recording. Because of various delays in setup, we got started almost an hour late. After an extremely tense day of recording, I expressed my disappointment to the manager, who replied, &#8220;We&#8217;ve been working with Joe Walsh recently — he books 10 a.m., usually shows up at noon, and we like it that way!&#8221; (If you want to know which studio, just call me.)</p>
<p>Unless it&#8217;s a &#8220;live mix&#8221; gig (see my <a href="../../../2009/08/live-mix-recording-two-television.html">SCO article</a> about live recording), most projects go back to the composer&#8217;s private digs or mine for mixing, and of course they started there as well with rough mixes, MIDI work, file prep, conversion, etc. That&#8217;s when the job for me may be a solitary one in the engineer department. But there are sometimes opportunities for engineer collaboration there as well, as was illustrated recently when I worked on an exciting Disney action-adventure score with composer Greg Edmonson.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Teamwork, Tag-team, and Sending a Sub</span><br />
It&#8217;s incredible how much work a composer has to do in a short amount of time, to meet a deadline on a film score. Burning the candle at both ends is old hat — how about both ends, the middle, several sides&#8230;? I take it as my responsibility to be a &#8220;safety net&#8221; for the composer, and make sure nothing gets missed in all the myriad of technical details that have to be attended to, even (especially) when the composer is sleep-deprived and desperately trying to get it all done on time.</p>
<p>Sometimes I consider the responsible thing to do is to ask someone to help out. If the composer needs an engineer to work both day and night, and I can recommend and train someone to continue with what we&#8217;re working on, I may make the suggestion to call in a &#8220;fresh horse&#8221;. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m not opposed to working hard, but I think the ultimate goal should be for the success of the project (not just the maximum number of hours on my clock).</p>
<p>That situation didn&#8217;t come up on this particular project, but a couple of things did that were similar: after several days of work mixes and preparation, Greg and I went into a commercial studio to record strings and brass. In his personal studio, he uses Logic, but Pro Tools is almost always used in public studios, so there is file preparation and conversion needed, from one software to the other and back again, which takes time. The composer didn&#8217;t want to wait, the following morning, for tracks to be consolidated and exported from Pro Tools before he could bring them into Logic and start editing them to match the MIDI parts, because of the looming mix delivery deadline.</p>
<p>So I called on my old friend and expert engineer David Appelt. When we finished with strings, he met us at the studio and took away a hard drive copy to another Pro Tools system (mine) and exported string submixes from all 40 cues. By the time we were done with the evening brass date, he came back over and delivered the files. Teamwork!</p>
<p>There are other situations that require sending a good sub. An old buddy, John the studio guitarist, once told me a definition of the free-lancer&#8217;s life: &#8220;The good news is, I have three gigs this week; the bad news is, they are all Tuesday morning at 10 o&#8217;clock!&#8221; We all work for more than one client, and sometimes there is a schedule conflict. And, on rare occasions one must call in sick, which happened on this job. I haven&#8217;t had anything worse than the sniffles for probably five years or more, but got a little slammed during the mixing process; it was great to have David available to come in and sub a couple of days without missing a beat.</p>
<p>If I have to send a sub, I would never send him in &#8220;cold&#8221;; I always have a detailed conversation with the other engineer to bring him up to speed on all the technical details he will need to know — software, mixing board, outboard gear, patching, and any personal preferences the composer might take for granted. I&#8217;m not such a control freak that I would totally set things up in advance or micro-manage everything. I believe a good experienced engineer works best with his brain fully engaged, and if he has to figure out one or two things or make some setup decisions himself, this can be helpful.</p>
<p>What makes someone a good sub? Two things, plain and sample: one, he has to be reliable, technically and business-wise, that is, he shows up on time and knows how to do the job right. And, second, he doesn&#8217;t try to schmooze the client or steal the gig. This isn&#8217;t the time to yak about your website or latest big feature. You&#8217;d be surprised how some don&#8217;t get that part. It&#8217;s a small town; ethics and relationships matter.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Collaborating with the Composer</span><br />
Last but not least, as a mixer I develop a good collaborative relationship with the man or woman who brought me there, the composer.</p>
<p>Because of the time-intensive nature of what we do, a mixer may well be the one professional that has more &#8220;face time&#8221; with the composer than anyone else on the job, be they studio musicians, orchestrators, whatever. It&#8217;s a situation that requires a lot of trust, confidentiality, and discretion. Often a discussion will come up that is more than just whether the guitar or oboe is loud enough — &#8220;Do you think this works? Which do you like better? Does that instrument sound in tune?&#8221; and so forth.</p>
<p>I have a pretty good background as a musician, with experience in classical, jazz, and pop. I have never played or composed professionally, and have no ambition to do so; I&#8217;m truly happy in a supportive role. But as a composer gets to know me, he or she often will find it useful to have a musician to bounce performance questions, production ideas, and other things off of. I would never impose myself when unwanted, or argue. With some clients it&#8217;s strictly about the technical business at hand, and I&#8217;m fine with that. But I come to work with all my experience and talents available, and feel most useful when I can contribute whatever is necessary to making the project as good as possible.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about — when it ends up great everyone shines, and maybe we even get to do it again!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow, I start my final year at USC. Because of that, today is my last day of full-time work at my current place of employment, Deane Ogden Music. This has easily been the best job I&#8217;ve had since moving to Los Angeles in 2004 and I will miss it greatly. Deane has generously taught me things about how to be a great composer and how to treat the people that you work with like royalty, and his influence on me is deep &#8211; I will miss hanging out with him, working alongside him, and watching a master craftsman accomplish his work.</p>
<p>Deane and Lee have asked me to stay on as managing editor of SCOREcastOnline.com, a position I accepted with a big fat smile on my face. One of the greatest things I&#8217;ve ever done in my life is have a hand in the creation of such a fabulous community of people as SCOREcast. We should not take lightly the generosity these two guys have shown in building this resource for all of us.</p>
<p>Last night, I was thinking about my career thusfar and how far I have come, and it was pretty overwhelming. Sometimes when you feel like you aren&#8217;t moving forward as quickly as you&#8217;d like to be, and then you write down everything you&#8217;ve accomplished so far, you realize you&#8217;ve done a lot. I&#8217;ve had people ask me why I haven&#8217;t struck out on my own yet as a composer and the truth is I just feel like I&#8217;m not ready to fly solo quite yet. I&#8217;m giving it another few months.</p>
<p>Because of the importance of the day, I&#8217;m in a bit of a sentimental mood. I wanted to get some thoughts down to you guys about my experiences so far. I&#8217;m not sure where I&#8217;m going with this, so it might not follow any kind of formal format, but they are my thoughts, nonetheless. I think they are worth something.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a studio scoring assistant for several years now, all while working my way through school at USC. My advisers have told me that the way I&#8217;m doing it is right &#8211; to take it easy while I&#8217;m in school before I get out there on my own, instead of trying to squeak by and scrimp and save as a student. Instead, I&#8217;ve decided to learn as much as I possibly can from people who are actually making a living in the film music business &#8211; composers who have &#8220;hit it&#8221; in terms of finding a way to live comfortably and stay successful over the long haul.</p>
<p>But man&#8230; it has been a long journey. Under my current composer, SCOREcast founder <a class="zem_slink" title="Deane Ogden" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1676420/" rel="imdb">Deane Ogden</a>, I&#8217;ve learned a ton. I also worked at Remote Control for quite awhile and that was an education all in itself. I work hard at learning this craft, and I would heartily recommend that anyone who is considering a career in film music assist a composer for a time before you launch out on your own. It will give you a head start that can not be obtained in any other way.</p>
<p>It kind of sounds mean, but the truth is that you can short-cut a lot of bullshit by watching someone else find their way through something. However, that is the essence of assisting &#8211; yes, you are there to help pull off something that maybe cannot be pulled off as a solo act, but for YOU, there is an education in front of you that should not be taken for granted. The fact that you can learn by seeing every possible situation come about without getting any of it on you, per se, is priceless.</p>
<p>Here are a few things, and a few stories, from my experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Compensation</h1>
<p><strong></strong>First of all, do not expect to make a fortune working as an assistant. I started out as an intern at Remote Control working for school credit, assisting several A-list and B-list (several who are <em>now</em> A-list) composers. I spent a lot of time orchestrating and programming. The first time I made any money was toward the end of my first year there working on the music team for the film &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" title="The Island (2005 film)" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399201/" rel="imdb">The Island</a>&#8221; with composer Steve Jablonsky. I wrote several arrangements for some of the source music on the film, not a very glamorous first job, but I was so happy to finally be making some cash doing anything musically related.</p>
<p>The first time I earned a solid wage (and by <em>solid</em>, I simply mean <em>consistent</em>) as an assistant wasn&#8217;t until a year after &#8220;The Island&#8221; when I began working on the music team for &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean II and III&#8221;. I made $15 an hour working on those two films as an assistant to several composers under the Remote Control roof.</p>
<p>Basically, there is no good answer to the question of compensation since the art of &#8220;assisting&#8221; is still relatively new in our business. It&#8217;s odd, but even though technology has supposedly made things better for composers, the learning curve has created an entirely new role that is now necessary for film composers to fill &#8211; programmers and assistants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Schedules</h1>
<p><strong></strong>The hours on the &#8220;Pirates&#8221; gigs were ridiculous&#8230; sometimes 16 or 17 hour days for weeks straight. I was paid every other week. Sometimes I&#8217;d work in upwards of 20 hours a day, only sleeping an hour here and an hour there. It was brutal. Since working for Deane, I might work 30 hours a week. BIG difference. Truth be told, working at Deane&#8217;s is completely different work than working anywhere else I have worked. Laid back, clear cut, no drama, precise. I know what my job is and I know what is expected. That is important when you are assisting. It still amazes me how most composers have zero idea what to have their assistants do every day, and a lot of time is wasted daily because of that. Since I started working for Deane, I&#8217;ve been able to write the scores to a few of my pals&#8217; student films, experience that I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to find if I was still working a job that required 90+ hours a week of my time.</p>
<p>I have a family and balancing home with work has been tough, but I think I&#8217;ve done well. I have a beautiful wife and a sweet 1 year-old baby girl. We have plenty of time together even though I am in school and working a full-time job. This year, I will only have school to finish up, and I&#8217;m really looking forward to major time at home. Deane has been great, and during his downtime, he has given me blocks of time off that I&#8217;ve used to my advantage with my family.</p>
<p>Sometimes I come in at 8AM, other times I don&#8217;t get in until after lunch. Deane doesn&#8217;t care as long as I get my work done. I have a punch list, and if it is done by the end of the day, what time I arrive doesn&#8217;t matter. If he has a meeting in the morning, I will start work earlier so that things are covered while he&#8217;s gone. If it is crunch time, well&#8230; we are in for the long haul until the project is finished. My family just knows that I&#8217;m under it for however long it takes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Duties</h1>
<p><strong></strong>I&#8217;ve done so many things for composers: studio rewires, software upgrades, additional composing, car washes, clothes shopping (yes!), and more. I&#8217;ll tell you, I even was asked once by a composer that I was working for to go pick up the dog doo in his yard while he took a phone call. This composer happened to be known for his practical joking, so I innocently asked, &#8220;Really? Are you joking or are you serious?&#8221; He put his hands in the air and yelled, &#8220;Do I look like I&#8217;m f*cking joking? GO!&#8221;</p>
<p>I <em>did</em> go&#8230; and after I was done picking up after the dog, I just kept going and never went back. The icing on the cake was months later, and I had moved on to working for Deane. Deane took me with him to a BMI event and we ran into Poop Guy at the bar. He either didn&#8217;t remember who I was, or he was too embarrassed to say &#8220;hi&#8221; to me. Deane said it was probably the latter&#8230; and to not worry&#8230; &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a dog&#8230; or a yard!&#8221;, he said with smile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Professionalism</h1>
<p><strong></strong>I&#8217;ve also had the opportunity to work with a lot of great directors while assisting composers. Directors can be very difficult to work with, or they can be easy as hell. I&#8217;ve dealt with both, and I&#8217;ve seen how composers deal with them, too. Some do a great job at appeasing directors and getting them what they want, and some don&#8217;t do so hot.</p>
<p>One time, I was working for a composer who was doing a cue on spec for a film that he really wanted to score. The film was a huge one (you would know it by name), and he was very excited that he was even being considered for the job.  After demoing for the job with this spec cue, we received word that we would not be working on this film. My composer was pissed. He got up after the call came in, picked up a chair that was next to his desk, and threw it into a rack of (luckily) old defunct gear. The rack fell over and everything cascaded onto the floor. Guess who got to pick *that* up?!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always found it interesting that even to the big guys, not getting the gig is as frustrating as getting it is exciting. Unfortunately, often times acting like a dumbass comes just as easy as acting honorably and professionally does to others.</p>
<p>In contrast, I worked for Graeme Revell for a time. I was in the room when he found out he didn&#8217;t get a gig he was up for. After hanging up the phone, he looked at me, shrugged his shoulders and said, &#8220;Well&#8230; that one&#8217;s out of our way!&#8221; Pure class.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having worked along side composers like <a class="zem_slink" title="Hans Zimmer" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001877/" rel="imdb">Hans Zimmer</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="Graeme Revell" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006251/" rel="imdb">Graeme Revell</a>, and more recently <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0413011/">Steve Jablonski</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0340003/">Rupert Gregson-Williams</a>, and SCOREcast founder <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1676420/">Deane Ogden</a>, I&#8217;ve gleaned much by watching how the big boys do it. One thing I&#8217;ve noticed about the really successful composers — They are all <span style="font-style: italic;">healthy</span>. Hans Zimmer rarely gets sick. If he does, it is the kind of sick that is over in a day, and I&#8217;ve never seen it cost him anything in terms of down time. Same with my current composer, SCOREcast founder Deane Ogden. When Deane first hired me, one of the first things he told me was to &#8220;stay healthy. We are no good to each other if we are on our backs.&#8221;</p>
<p>How do you stay healthy in the studio? It is possible, and most of it has to do with what we are talking about this month: Workflow. Even though you are sitting for the majority of it, life in the studio can be back-breaking work. Any environment where you are spending 14+ hours a day needs to be set up in a way that accomodates a relaxing workflow&#8230; one that helps, not hinders.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent an incredible amount of carefully thought out time and energy planning and conceptualizing my studio layout for one reason: I don&#8217;t want to get hurt. I have worked in some very nice situations in this town as a scoring assistant, witnessing first-hand the most comfortable studios that money can buy along with some of the most poorly laid out studios one could imagine. I know guys that have horrible back problems that stem from sitting in cheap chairs for days. I have seen many composers have to start wearing glasses because of the activity of assailing their eyesight with poorly color-calibrated monitors while trying to get music written. Orchestrator Susie Benchasil said in a SCOREcast <a href="../../../2009/05/scorecast-no19-shownotes.html">interview</a> once that she knows a lot of people in the business that have issues of poor circulation due to simply not moving their legs enough and sitting on their posteriors for days at a time with little to no physical activity happening. Composing, it seems, can be hazardous to your health, so it&#8217;s no surprise that any composer worth his or her salt will tell you that <span style="font-style: italic;">health</span> is of optimum concern in the studio. In fact, at my old stomping grounds of Remote Control, a mandate was handed down by the Lion King himself that every composer use the same brand of desk. Hans believed that a particular desk from a particular company kept back fatigue to a minimum, so everyone was supplied with one, whether they liked it or not.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time watching how pro composers do things when I get invited into their &#8220;inner sanctums&#8221;. That is a rare treat and I never want to squander the opportunity. Since not having to re-invent the wheel is priceless knowledge to have, I&#8217;ll attempt to outline a few of the things that I&#8217;ve picked up along the way. It might take me a few posts to get in everything that I want to, but I&#8217;ll get it done. We&#8217;ll call this the first in a series for this month from me.</p>
<h1>Musical Chairs</h1>
<p>In our studio, Deane and I listen to a lot of podcasts. When we are wiring, assembling demos, or some other menial task that doesn&#8217;t require us speaking to each other for lengths at a time, we listen to what others are doing in various fields and try to apply those new ideas to our own craft, if applicable. We recently heard <a class="zem_slink" title="Stephen King" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King" rel="wikipedia">Stephen King</a> say that he likens &#8220;writing in your studio to &#8216;creative sleep&#8217;.&#8221; What he meant by that is this: Everything in your bedroom is engineered to help you fall asleep so you can dream. It&#8217;s dark, the doors are locked, and the temperature is right. The pillows are the perfect softness, and comforter is just the right thickness, and the bed doesn&#8217;t have any lumps in it. Your studio should be the same way. When you close the door to your writing space, you should now be completely free of any discomforts so that you may &#8220;dream&#8221; the right score for the film.</p>
<p>The cornerstone to making this happen is the chair you are sitting in. You are in your chair for up to 14 hours a day, so you need to have one that is not good, but <span style="font-style: italic;">great</span>. Your task chair is not something you want to be cheap about, believe me. It is one of those things where you are either going to pay now, or pay later. But you <span style="font-style: italic;">will</span> pay. (Preferably in the form of dollars to a place that sells chairs and not dollars to a chiropractor!)</p>
<p>Your chair should be first of all, sturdy. These chairs that you see at places like Staples and Office Depot — those aren&#8217;t going to work. In the office furniture business, there is a lingo&#8230; much like what we have as composers. There are chairs that are specifically designed for &#8220;tasking&#8221;, and this is a paraphrase, but it basically means &#8220;jobs that are done while hunched over a workstation desk&#8221;. That&#8217;s us! When searching for the right chair for your studio, you want to be looking specifically for a &#8220;task chair&#8221;.</p>
<p>My advice would be to look at two &#8220;task chair&#8221; companies: Steel Case and Herman Miller.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/global">Herman Miller</a> is what Deane and Lee both use in their studios. At Deane&#8217;s place, we have a couple of Herman Miller <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/Products/Aeron-Chairs">Aeron Chairs</a>. These chairs are the bomb.</p>
<div class="zemanta-img zemanta-action-dragged" style="display: block; float: right; margin: 1em; width: 310px;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Aeron_chair_JN.jpg"><img style="display: block;" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ec/Aeron_chair_JN.jpg/300px-Aeron_chair_JN.jpg" alt="Aeron chair" width="300" height="321" /></a>Image via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Aeron_chair_JN.jpg">Wikipedia</a></div>
<p>They are a little expensive, but again, you cannot skimp on this part of your studio. Remember what I said: You&#8217;ll either pay the price now or pay the price later. Your choice. Aeron Chairs are completely adjustable and come in several different sizes. They also have one of the best warrantes in the business and Herman Millr is a trusted name in seating and has been for decades. This is not some fly-by-night mom-and-pop that will be gone tomorrow. HM chairs are everywhere — even <a class="zem_slink" title="Donald Trump" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump" rel="wikipedia">Donald Trump</a> sits in one!</p>
<p>Herman Miller also makes a chair called the <a href="http://www.ultimatebackstore.com/product-exec/product_id/351/pn/Celle_Chair_-_Quick_Ship">Celle Chair</a>. Celle Chairs are less expensive than the Aeron Chair, but provide many of the same features such as adjustable lumbar support and adjustable armrests. The major difference between the two is that the Celle lacks the <span style="font-style: italic;">total</span> adjustability that the Aeron Chair is famous for, but if you don&#8217;t need that or you are fairly average sized, the Celle will work great for you. Plus, it is considerably less money — about $400 for a brand new Celle Chair.</p>
<p>I get Deane&#8217;s HM chairs from a company in Chicago called The Ultimate Back Store. These guys often have great deals on HM products and sometimes even have floor models they&#8217;ll sell for less, but still have the same warranty as a brand new one. They also will ship the chair for free and have service centers that will come to your studio and fix the chair should anything ever break or go wrong. (When does THAT happen ever?)</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Herman Miller Task Chairs</span><br />
Fully adjustable, comes in various sizes to fit your body type, 12-year &#8220;no-fault&#8221; warranty<br />
Price range: $400 USD (Celle) -$700 USD (Aeron)<br />
<a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/global">Herman Miller.com</a><br />
<a href="http://www.ultimatebackstore.com/">The Ultimate Back Store</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.steelcase.com/">Steel Case</a> is also another company that makes amazing task chairs. Their <a href="http://www.steelcase.com/na/leap_products.aspx?f=11852">Leap Chair</a> is a favorite at several studios I&#8217;ve worked in like Capitol Records and the Power Station in New York (which is wh<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fZp_xxfyktg/SlTTHGpP-OI/AAAAAAAAABo/E4AFclokJRw/s1600-h/steelcase.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5356137975846533346" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 203px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 203px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fZp_xxfyktg/SlTTHGpP-OI/AAAAAAAAABo/E4AFclokJRw/s320/steelcase.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>ere I first sat in one). They are a little more expensive than the Herman Miller Aeron Chair, coming in at around $850, but they are well worth the money and come with a full lifetime warranty.</p>
<p>Steel Case also makes a handful of other models that sport several other configurations to accomodate both your price range and feature set requirements. I would suggest checking out their company website to see what they have to offer. The Ultimate Back Store also carries Steel Case, and as the Herman Miller stuff, they regularly offer floor models for sale at heavy discounts. The best thing to do with UBS is call them and talk to a human being. They are great to deal with.</p>
<p>Steel Case is a great alternative to Herman Miller on many levels, especially price.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Steel Case Task Chairs</span><br />
Fully to semi-adjustable, comes in various sizes to fit your body type, limited lifetime warranty<br />
Price range: $300 USD (Uno) &#8211; $900 USD (Leap)<br />
<a href="http://www.steelcase.com/na/">Steel Case</a><br />
<a href="http://www.ultimatebackstore.com/file_include-exec/file/steelcase?hs340=leftnav_steelcase">The Ultimate Back Store</a></p>
<p>So, obviously there a hundred different ways to go with a task chair, and these are only two of my favorites. Of course your studio has certain requirements that we don&#8217;t have in Deane&#8217;s studio — every space is different. Maybe you turn to the side to play your keyboard controller or perhaps it is centered under your desk in front of you. Maybe you use an outboard mixing console, so you need to be able to &#8220;Alex Keaton&#8221; your way across the room and roll to where your outboard rig is set up.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, your chair is the epicenter of your whirlwind. It has to be great, not just <span style="font-style: italic;">good</span>. It will be the one piece of gear that sustains you over time and keeps you from pain.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/sig-sanders2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-694" title="sig-sanders" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/sig-sanders2.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>A beginning is a delicate time… or so I&#8217;ve heard. So I want to begin my column here on SCOREcast with what I&#8217;m going to try to cover—which is nearly everything—and a few words about my plan of attack.</p>
<p>I like to work &#8220;big to small.&#8221; In other words, I try to start with the overarching concept, and then work out the details as I go. That way, if I&#8217;ve omitted anything, you have the larger context, and can figure out the details yourself. If you&#8217;re cool with that, read on…</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s Big Picture has to do with self-assessment, and it&#8217;s a metaphor from (American) football: coaches talk about their teams&#8217; performance in terms of <span style="font-style: italic;">phases of the game</span>. In football, the three phases are offense, defense and special teams (like kicking field goals or returning punts).</p>
<p>A coach might say: &#8220;We dominated the offensive phase of the game today. But we got beat on special teams, and those twelve field goals (!) they scored really hurt us.&#8221; What he&#8217;s saying is that his team had a critical <span style="font-style: italic;">imbalance</span>—one facet of their performance wasn&#8217;t up to standard. And the team&#8217;s overall game suffered as a result.</p>
<p>Football teams that excel in one phase of the game can win individual contests; they might even beat a particular opponent regularly (they &#8220;match up well&#8221; against a certain defense, e.g.). Teams that are strong in every phase of the game, though… those teams have the potential to become legend.</p>
<p>So it is with us as composers. We&#8217;re talking about diversity this month, and I think a good way to approach this topic is to look at our own diversity. What are we great at? Where do our skills fall down? How can we target our efforts to improve?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Here&#8217;s a little quiz:</span> rate yourself from one to five in each area. A one indicates little or no experience; a five is world-class mastery. Be honest—no one&#8217;s looking at this but you. I&#8217;ve picked areas that I&#8217;ve found to be important in my own career; your mileage may vary, but I doubt it&#8217;ll vary by much.</p>
<p>Some of the &#8220;phases of the game&#8221; I&#8217;m including below are crucial; others are merely <span style="font-style: italic;">important</span> from time to time or if you&#8217;re wanting to break into a certain area of the biz. The quiz is primarily aimed at composers, though many of the topics apply to anyone in our crazy little corner of the music world.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve taken the quiz, rate yourself. You&#8217;ve created a snapshot of your skill set—and now you can analyze that data. What does the graph of your skill set look like? How would you like it to look in six months… a year… five years? What&#8217;s the best way to get there?</p>
<p>You may decide to play to your strengths by beefing up the phases in which you&#8217;re already strong… or shore up those phases where you aren&#8217;t. That&#8217;s up to you. I hope this tool will be valuable, though, no matter where you find yourself in your career.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Music composiiton: Plain ol&#8217; tonal harmony</span><br />
1. Piano sound pretty! Sometimes…<br />
2. I have a basic understanding of scales and simple common practice period harmonization.<br />
3. I can perform a Roman-numeral analysis of, say, a Bach chorale.<br />
4. Secondary dominants, predominant chords and chromaticism are familiar territory to me.<br />
5. Tonality is my playground—to be used or transcended at will.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Music composition: Advanced harmony/modern techniques</span><br />
1. Um, why are all those ugly notes in there?<br />
2. I&#8217;ve studied a few serial and atonal works, and can &#8220;think in octatonic&#8221; or other scale forms.<br />
3. Alternate tunings and notations; minimalism; musique concrete… I&#8217;m cool with all that.<br />
4. I&#8217;m just as comfortable writing outside the tonal system as I am working within it.<br />
5. The full range of sonic expression is at my fingertips. I&#8217;m involved in creating what comes next.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Music composition: Contemporary</span><br />
1. Who is this Diddy of which you speak?<br />
2. I can crank out a lead sheet.<br />
3. I&#8217;ve studied production in one or more styles: Jazz, Hip Hop, Latin, etc.<br />
4. I work regularly in one or more contemporary/popular music genres.<br />
5. Whatever a client needs, I can deliver—regardless of style.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Orchestration</span><br />
1. Hey, the big instruments play lower! Handy to remember, huh?<br />
2. I know the instrumental families and have a pretty good grasp of ranges.<br />
3. I understand balance and blend, and know the idiomatic tendencies of most standard instruments.<br />
4. Orchestration is an integral, instinctual part of my process from the moment I conceive a musical idea.<br />
5. I could teach Ravel a thing or two.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Conducting</span><br />
1. Floor, wall, wall, ceiling… but what if the cue is in 3/4?<br />
2. I know basic conducting patterns and recording session protocol.<br />
3. I&#8217;m comfortable at the podium, conducting for a variety of ensembles and/or styles.<br />
4. My skills and experience allow me to interpret a performance—not just survive it—regardless of the musical terrain.<br />
5. I am a professional conductor.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mixing</span><br />
1. …These go to eleven.<br />
2. I understand basic signal path, but my mixes aren&#8217;t consistently solid.<br />
3. I have a strategy for building my mixes and a set of go-to tools for fixing problems.<br />
4. My mixes are an expression of my musical opinion and personality, executed with the same control as the writing itself.<br />
5. I&#8217;m a full-time professional mixer.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Performance</span><br />
1. Never picked up a musical instrument in my life (um… seriously?)<br />
2. I&#8217;ve dabbled on one or more instruments, but never taken lessons.<br />
3. I&#8217;ve studied, but wouldn&#8217;t be comfortable putting my performances on recordings.<br />
4. I&#8217;m a competent musician on one or more instruments.<br />
5. I&#8217;m a full-time professional musician.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gear: Hardware</span><br />
1. I haven&#8217;t really started thinking about my own studio. I have a computer, but no other gear.<br />
2. I can use my computer to record sound. Not that it&#8217;s sound someone would pay actual money for (yet…).<br />
3. I have a functioning home studio, but I&#8217;d like to expand in order to get a better sound.<br />
4. My home/project studio is more than simply adequate—it&#8217;s a resource, and sometimes an inspiration.<br />
5. Those guys at Remote Control… they&#8217;re cool and all, but they need more gear.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gear: Library</span><br />
1. You mean people sell sounds? That you can buy? Weird!<br />
2. I have a basic set of samples, but nothing fancy or exotic.<br />
3. My studio is armed with a reasonable variety of samples, loops, virtual instruments, synths, etc.<br />
4. I can call up pretty much any sound I need, in nearly any style I&#8217;d be asked to write.<br />
5. If it&#8217;s out there, I own it. If it&#8217;s not out there yet, I&#8217;m probably beta-testing it.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gear: Expertise</span><br />
1. I know where the ON switch is, but I&#8217;m a little afraid to start pushing buttons.<br />
2. Where&#8217;s that manual again? I&#8217;m digging in, but have a lot to learn.<br />
3. I can run my gear with no problem, but some of the power-user commands are a mystery.<br />
4. I have my own macros/custom key bindings for sequencing, and each piece of gear is optimized for my work flow.<br />
5. I build my own electronic gear and/or work as a developer for a manufacturer.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Film Music History</span><br />
1. Buncha old guys wrote some tunes. What&#8217;s the big deal?<br />
2. I know the basic history of the art form, and a few of the &#8220;big names.&#8221;<br />
3. I&#8217;ve listened to numerous scores from across the decades, and have a working knowledge of film music history.<br />
4. I&#8217;ve written (term papers count) about multiple film composers, studied scores old and new, and can identify style and approximate historical period from a &#8220;needle-drop.&#8221;<br />
5. Bring it on, Tony Thomas… I am a veritable Film Music History encyclopedia.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Film History</span><br />

Years ago I worked on monstrous analog synthesizers &#8211; and like everyone else I&#8217;ve seen them shrink to computer-screen-sized virtual emulations. Just a few weeks ago I was touring a major scoring stage in town. They showed me the blank wall plate and large empty floor space in the control room where the multi-track recording units at one time dominated of the room. It was odd to see the outline of that portion of the floor where the big heavy recorders used to sit &#8211; it resembled a photo negative of a chalk outline for a dead (rectangular) body.</p>
<p>Like so many others, I went from a room full of synthesizers, effects and recording gear to a single keyboard-based workstation with built-in sequencer and effects. I held out through the transition from analog to digital tape (at least in my own studio) and moved directly to computer-based recording. At that point, I was as eager as anyone to put everything &#8220;in the box&#8221;. It seemed like desktop computing and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore&#8217;s Law</a> was going to completely subsume the inherent limitations of hardware-specific processing. Of course there have been exceptions, from the continued development of dedicated hardware by a diminishing number of manufacturers &#8211; to the DSP-based add-on cards that support recording, effects and synthesis with the computer as the front-end. But, regardless of those stalwarts, the march toward software-based *everything* seemed inevitable.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s hasn&#8217;t been all paradise in the land of the desktop. There are the always-looming hardware and software incompatibilities, not to mention the nearly-constant quest from more processing power. So many times those two factors are in a tug-of-war with each other &#8211; particularly with the current fits and starts toward native 64-bit computing. And from the manufacturers&#8217; perspectives, piracy has played a large part in their reticence to embrace the paradigm shift. In the midst of those contending factors there has been an interesting convergence &#8211; hardware seems to be making a kind of comeback. (and some would say *another* comeback) As it turns out, Moore&#8217;s Law is a rising tide that lifts all ships &#8211; including specialized DSP processors. It has made it possible to put more power into specialized processors, and that in turn has allowed some hardware manufacturers to stake out new territory in the changing studio landscape. And several of those hardware-centric companies have been putting some effort into integrating their products into the computer-centered studio.</p>
<p>For me, the migration back to hardware was nearly accidental. It started with my work on a new synthesizer from a company that started out as a plug-in designer. I helped to write the owner&#8217;s manual for that synth, and between the massive amount of DSP power and front panel control plus the greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts architecture, I had to make it a permanent part of my studio. The next step on the slippery slope toward next-generation hardware was the change to a new audio interface on my main audio workstation. The device has a surprising amount of dedicated DSP on-board which can be used as a fully integrated plug-in in my sequencing environment. This one factor has caused me to go back and re-configure my scoring template &#8211; the built-in reverb on the audio interface is *that* good. And now I&#8217;m waiting on delivery of a new synthesizer that seamlessly integrates with the audio interface and sequencing environment to the point that it has all of the look and feel of a software-based plug-in. The beauty of it is that the one-hundred-plus voices and myriad effects are generated from a single-space rack mounted unit.</p>
<p>It truly is the best of both worlds &#8211; but the irony is not lost on me. Even for orchestra-heavy cues, a substantial portion (and sometimes an outright majority) of sound in my studio is once again being generated by dedicated outboard hardware. Since I have found myself back in this position nearly by accident, it makes me wonder how and if other composers are re-discovering the potential advantage of dedicated hardware in their studio.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/sig-meghan.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-467" title="sig-meghan" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/sig-meghan.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>My passion to create music for film drives me. I am still a university student, and therefore am learning the essentials, but the real valuable lessons I have learned about this business have not been from lectures and exercises in harmonic theory. The most important things I’ve learned about building and maintaining a career as a film composer have come from two things: Watching my boss balance his personal and professional life, and looking into the eyes of my 9-month-old daughter every night when I get home from the studio or from a long day of classes. You see, my equation for success in all of this looks something like this: Experience + Values = Success. We’ll see if my foresight pays off. Call me in 20 years.</div>
<p style="text-align: left;">There was a time when I thought my boss (Deane) was an idiot (sorry dude! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> because he regularly schedules time to be with his family. I used to think to myself, “How can he expect to maintain his success if he constantly gives up time in the studio to hang out at the beach?” But then, after months of observing how he spends that time in the studio, I began to understand that he doesn’t “give up” anything to the benefit of anything else. Instead, he carefully plans out each hour of the day so that he can be home when he needs to be home and at work when he needs to be at work. For him, no moments in the studio are wasted. Everything has a purpose and a reason, the ultimate goal being balance and harmony between home life and work life.</p>
<p>In my former life as a “Remote Controlian”, this was a foreign concept to me. At that job, the success equation looked a little different. It was more like <em>Time at RC &#8211; Your Life = Success</em>. For a lot of us, this is how we are used to working – abandoning every other aspect of our lives in favor of the studio’s demands. In some cases, this cannot be helped, and I’ve learned that working with Deane as well. Best intentions be damned, deadline week is always deadline week, and you might as well face that you are going to be there late into the night – possibly overnight – and sometimes on multiple nights. But it *is* possible to carefully map out your time so that you allow for every part of your life to have a rightful place.</p>
<p>Here are five things we do at Deane’s studio to help us get home to what matters most and keep our significant others from setting our laptops on fire.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Do the tough stuff first.</span> When I get to work, I have a list of stuff I need to get done for the entire week. Sometimes it is prioritized, and sometimes it is not. Some things are simple projects that I know will take me an hour to accomplish, while others are long term projects that are going to take months. No matter what, I first select the things I’m not looking forward to but are short term projects and I do them first. Doing this allows me to knock out half the list in the first day or two of the week, which is a great feeling, and gives me an early sense of accomplishment before the crush of the week kicks in.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Engage “Stealth Mode” when necessary.</span> Ever since being tasked with getting SCOREcastOnline.com up and running, I’ve taken this method from Deane and made it my own. Deane will sometimes say to me, “Okay dude, I’m going into “Stealth Mode”. This basically means that he is not going to answer calls, emails, or questions from anyone unless someone has been shot or killed, and even then, he’ll think about it. “Cloak Mode” drives his manager crazy and makes people mad sometimes, but if he *told* everyone to leave him alone for 7 hours, they simply wouldn’t. People are like little kids &#8211; when you tell them NOT to do something, it makes them want to do it even more. For Deane, only Susie and the director/producers of our current film are the kryptonite for “Stealth Mode”. For me, it’s Deane or my wife. Everyone else has to wait.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remove all distractions from your workspace.</span> If you do not want to be a slave to your studio, then you really need to do this. At Deane’s we have the “List”. The List contains things that are available to do, but completely non-beneficial to our work at the studio. Some of the goofy ones are things like “checking your Facebook” or “playing Warcraft”. But we also say that “getting involved in other people’s crises” is a List item and can be a huge time-sucking distraction from work. So are “emails that take longer than 5 minutes to write”. If they do, they are considered a distraction, and you should probably just pick up the phone and make the call. It’s quicker and it leaves less room for confusion anyhow.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Learn and live the Covey Quadrant System.</span><br />
I’d never heard of this system before I worked at Deane’s studio, but it kicks all kinds of ass. Basical<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fZp_xxfyktg/SiZD08HE_ZI/AAAAAAAAABI/WNiO81TsnmM/s1600-h/covey-quadrants.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5343032584689745298" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 188px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 188px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fZp_xxfyktg/SiZD08HE_ZI/AAAAAAAAABI/WNiO81TsnmM/s320/covey-quadrants.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>ly, it starts with the basic understanding that you can categorize everything that happens in a work day into one of four quadrants: Things that are important and urgent (Q1); important but not urgent (Q2); urgent but not important (Q3); and finally, not urgent and not important (Q4). Q4 items can just immediately be thrown away &#8211; stuff like junk mail, spam, and stuff you absolutely hate doing and don’t have to (like mowing the lawn &#8211; just hire a gardener!). Q1 items are things that are life and death issues and must be dealt with immediately (your spouse gets in a car wreck, picture edits while on the scoring stage). Q3 items are things that are crises for others, but not necessarily for you (“tech’ing” someone over the phone on computer stuff &#8211; this happens to me almost daily!). And Q2 is where you want to try and spend the majority of your time. Learn this system, memorize it, and most importantly, use it. It will change your life and save you hours upon hours of precious time.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Get to bed early and get up to go to work earlier.</span> I know&#8230; this sounds sacrilegious to most of you studio rats, but trust me, it is better for you. Your mind will work faster for it and you’ll get more done working in the first part of the day than you will the last part. The argument against this principle always goes something like this: “I can’t get up early. I’m just not a morning person.” I bet if there was an earthquake at 3am, you’d be up and out of bed with no hesitation, coherent and soberingly aware of what needed to be done. That is because it is important to you. Therefore, if you wanted to, you could get out of bed at 4am rather than getting into bed at 4am. Most doctors will tell you that if you miss out on the sleep hours of 12am-3am, you might as well just stay up all night. Those are the average critical deep sleep pattern windows for the human body. If you are staying up until the wee hours of the night and then sleeping until late morning, you are fooling yourself into thinking that you are being the most productive. Try it. You’ll thank me later.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are hundreds of other ways I could mention that will help you live a more balanced life between studio and home. The honest truth is that it all simply comes down to choices. Do you want it, or do you not? You have to decide that for yourself. The bottom line is that there are about 14 healthy work hours in every single day. Are you *really* redeeming every single minute of every hour that you have been given?</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

There is a season (turn, turn, turn)<br />
And a time for every purpose, under heaven</p></blockquote>
