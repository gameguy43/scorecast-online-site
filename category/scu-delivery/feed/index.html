Although every project is a little bit different, there are some standard procedures, and we&#8217;ll go over them, with some definitions, a few precautions, and one or two minefields.<span id="more-299"></span></p>
<p>Before I get started, it&#8217;s a good time to remind you that it&#8217;s always a good idea to ask your clients what their delivery requirements are. If the producer or director can’t tell you directly, they will refer you to a post production mixer or technician who will have all the answers.</p>
<p><a href="../../../2009/09/technical-guidelines-for-film-and-tv.html">In a past article</a>, I&#8217;ve gone over standard digital file issues, such as sample rate and bit depth. Review if needed. Of course you will be delivering finished mixes (or sometimes &#8220;stems&#8221;), not raw unmixed instrument tracks.</p>
<p>Since most postproduction work is done using ProTools, you will probably be asked to deliver in either a ProTools &#8220;session&#8221; file or at least something that&#8217;s easily imported into ProTools. Some composers are already equipped with ProTools software and hardware, but I wouldn&#8217;t say most are. So you might say, &#8220;Well, if I have to turn in something in ProTools, then how about if I just get a little cheap ProTools LE system?&#8221; But there&#8217;s a hitch — unlike its (expensive!) big brother ProTools HD, the LE systems do not support timecode, unless you pay extra for &#8220;post-production toolkit&#8221; features.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s pause for a moment and review what our intent is here: you have prepared each piece of music to go at exactly a certain spot in the film, usually defined by a timecode starting number. Just because you are viewing the video in your DAW software (Logic, DP, etc.) doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that the music will automatically go to the right place on the dubstage; someone needs to place it there in their DAW software, i.e. ProTools. An important distinction is that when you are in &#8220;composing work mode&#8221; you will have each piece of music in a separate file or chunk, but for the dub mix they will all need to be in one common &#8220;session&#8221; file.</p>
<p>For several years I&#8217;ve worked with composer Greg Edmonson on the show <em>King of the Hill</em> (Fox TV), and after the composing process in Logic, part of my job was to put all the mixes into ProTools for delivery. Here in brief is my workflow for that:</p>
<p>Each cue was mixed in Logic and then exported as a 24-bit 48K WAV file (either one interleaved stereo file or two mono files will work equally well, but stay tuned for one small hitch in this process). Then in ProTools HD those files were imported onto tracks, one at a time, and &#8220;spotted&#8221; to the right start location by timecode. It&#8217;s pretty common as I mix for the file I create to not start at bar 1 beat 1, but before, to accommodate instruments which may attack slightly early — so it&#8217;s important to keep a list of timecode starts for each file, which may be a different number than the music downbeat.</p>
<p>I usually use two stereo tracks (or sets of tracks), and alternate odd-numbered and even-numbered cues. This allows for any cues that may overlap each other at the start/end. Sometimes there is an additional track as well for source cues, which may be overlength.<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
No ProTools?</span><br />
So that&#8217;s pretty basic, but as I mentioned before, what if you don&#8217;t have a timecode version of ProTools? That&#8217;s when it pays to really know your clients, and figure out how to accommodate their needs. Some of my composer clients are able to simply deliver a folder of stereo files, with a list of timecode start numbers. There may be an editor who is willing to take a few minutes to drop the music in the right places. On a higher-budget gig that might actually be an official Music Editor, a professional who can be a tremendous help to a composer in many ways. Sadly, they are rare in lower-budget projects.</p>
<p>My colleague Randy Knaub writes about the <a href="../../../2010/04/randy-knaub-better-delivery-with-omf.html">use of OMF and AAF file formats</a>, and I&#8217;ll leave it to him to explain this. This allows you to use some other DAW software to create a file which should be compatible with ProTools. I have just a couple of reservations about this: if you do deliver this way then it&#8217;s important to have someone &#8220;on the premises&#8221; check the work and make sure everything has ended up in the right place. I would avoid any edits, punch-ins, fades, and automation. Those are not appropriate in a score delivery anyway. Also, in the ProTools world, the ability to open and accommodate these files is a paid option (and somewhat expensive depending on your point of view — another nice Digi/Avid wallet zinger), so check in advance to see whether your client can accommodate this.<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
Time stamping</span><br />
One thing that will help your music to go in exactly the right place is to use files that are time stamped. Most DAW apps can create and accommodate file time stamping. Then in ProTools the file can be easily spotted automatically to the intended location, avoiding the tedium of typing in all the numbers.</p>
<p>Digital Performer automatically and reliably adds time stamping to any WAV file, when your project file is set to the correct time start number and you record in real time. However, annoyingly, Logic will not. (Yes, I know they say it will, but I found that sometimes it correctly timestamps a WAV file and sometimes it doesn&#8217;t, with no predictable rhyme or reason. It&#8217;s a bug that has existed since Logic 6 or before; I’ve found this with more than one client under a variety of circumstances. In repeated inquiries I have found Logic tech support and local reps had no clue why and didn&#8217;t seem much interested. Ideas?)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">File types NOT to use</span><br />
In previous articles I discussed file types, but it&#8217;s worth mentioning again that some computer compatible file types are not appropriate for professional production work: MP3 and AAC. These &#8220;lossy&#8221; file types are intentionally &#8220;shrunk&#8221; in order to make them easier to e-mail or transfer quickly through the Internet, but this is done by intentionally throwing away part of the sound data.</p>
<p>If you need to deliver over the Internet, this is a good place to use FTP or an iDisk; don&#8217;t compromise the music you&#8217;ve worked hard on by then compressing it to e-mail it. If you&#8217;re placing a piece of music downloaded from a service like iTunes, try to get an original copy CD instead, and extract an AIFF file from that.</p>
<p>It really makes a substantial difference in how good things sound. Maybe it’s a hassle, but if you are going to be committed to working hard to making your music sound great, then why not have those elements as good as they can be as well?</p>
<p>This may be a situation in which you educate your client as well. Suppose they ask you to send an MP3, or maybe send you one of some source music. On little speakers on a computer it probably doesn’t sound any different. But I promise you on the loudspeakers in a dubstage, or after broadcast processing, the difference in richness and punch will be substantial. Plus if there needs to be editing or EQ then an uncompressed file will respond better to that, with less deterioration. Like blowing up a photograph really big—do you see lots of blurry mushy pixels or is it detailed and focused even at large magnification?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fight the bad</span><br />
For a variety of reasons, I hear a lot of music that doesn&#8217;t sound as good as I think it could or should, especially on television, sorry to say it. I know there are a lot of challenges.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all heard, and probably said, &#8220;It&#8217;s good enough for&#8230;&#8221;. Fill in the blank — For TV. For no money. For an impossible deadline. For those @#$%s who made me stay up all night to do five rewrites.</p>
<p>My humble suggestion: Fight the temptation. If you insist on quality, from the smallest detail like avoiding MP3s, to everything else, all the way to the top of your professional and personal &#8220;food chain&#8221;, you will feel better about your work, and others will notice. Isn&#8217;t that how you want to be?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-366" href="../../../2010/04/21/delivery-finaling-and-changing-world/sig-sanders"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-366" title="sig-sanders" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sig-sanders.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>I&#8217;ve already outlined a few technical thoughts on delivery and &#8220;finaling&#8221; (whatever <em>that</em> is) in my Weekend Provocations this month… and I&#8217;ll continue to do so in the weeks to come.<br />
As I began to write today&#8217;s article, though, I realized that our April focus itself is built on some assumptions. Those assumptions, and their ramifications, after the jump.<br />
<a name="more"></a>First, we&#8217;re assuming you actually have a gig. In other words, you actually succeeded in convincing a filmmaker that you&#8217;re worthy to collaborate with them on their project. This seems to be the toughest step for a lot of people, and we devote a significant amount of time here on SCOREcast to helping you achieve this goal. This month, though, that&#8217;s a given.</p>
<p>Second assumption: You&#8217;ve successfully threaded your way through the various pitfalls that accompany a typical scoring assignment. Anyone who&#8217;s been around for any length of time will tell you that&#8217;s not the easiest thing. You&#8217;re to be congratulated. Seriously.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve worked on a fair few projects that ended without any sort of closure—either the filmmakers decided they wanted to go in a different direction, or the show simply tanked. Either way, the process of &#8220;delivery and finaling&#8221; didn&#8217;t just grind to a halt—it ceased to exist altogether. And that&#8217;s something you should be prepared for, mentally and emotionally. This is a business, and no one in the executive ranks cares whether you achieve a warm and fuzzy feeling at the end of the workday.</p>
<p>Those are two <em>big</em> assumptions for us to make here at SCOREcast. And thanks for bearing with me through this tour of the obvious. Here&#8217;s the point—what <em>can&#8217;t</em> we assume?</p>
<p>The part we can&#8217;t assume is that what is being delivered—i.e., a musical cargo so precious, we&#8217;re spending an entire <em>month</em> just talking about how to deliver it safely, securely and properly organized!—is, in fact, worth anything. I mean, some of the procedures we&#8217;re outlining here are fairly involved and time-intensive… is your stuff really so good that it&#8217;s worth the time and hassle?</p>
<p>In order for you to consistently do a professional job of &#8220;putting the project to bed,&#8221; you have to believe, with passion and conviction, that the answer is <strong>yes</strong>. This phase of the game is no different than any other in that regard. If your score is &#8220;mailed in,&#8221; you might as well just… mail it in.</p>
<p>Just upload some mp3s to your iDisk. The guy cutting on the AVID (what&#8217;s his name again?) will figure out any formatting problems. 2-pop? No 2-pop? Who cares? They&#8217;ll probably move the cue around, or cut it up, or dump it, anyway.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time and effort in my articles talking about our process, our mental and psychological state as composers. Getting your inner game in the right place to do the job in all its phases.</p>
<p>In the particular phase we&#8217;re focusing on now, I think you can see all that airy talk actually starting to become useful (!). If you&#8217;re not convinced of the worth of your product, you won&#8217;t take the fussy-but-critical steps necessary to see that that product reaches its destination intact and in perfect shape.</p>
<p>And the bigger the project, the fussier and more critical those steps become. And so the more you have to believe. It&#8217;s <em>your</em> energy and commitment that drives the project to completion. As vital as your music team is to the success of a project, it&#8217;s ultimately you who has to be the impetus. If you want to change the world, even in the sometimes small and indirect way that&#8217;s within our power as film composers, you have to assume that burden.</p>
<p>So… with all that in mind, here are some final thoughts:<br />
1. You can start making a difference in the world any time you think you&#8217;re ready.<br />
2. If you believe what I just wrote, and if you believe in yourself, it&#8217;s generally better to start taking risks too early than too late.</p>
<p>…the rest is details. Granted, there are a lot of details (!), and a big part of what we&#8217;re about as a community is amassing the collective wisdom in order to get through those details in a smart way… but the Big Picture (and, despite the nuts-and-bolts title of my monthly column, I am at heart a Big-Picture kind of guy) is that we&#8217;re all playing for stakes.</p>
<p>Most people&#8217;s jobs allow them, at best, the opportunity to affect only a few grains of sand on the beach that is humanity. Maybe they can change those few grains profoundly… I&#8217;m not denigrating the importance of anyone&#8217;s chosen field of endeavor. But as partners in the storytelling enterprise, I think it&#8217;s important for us to keep in mind that we&#8217;re playing for the entire beach.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sig-sanders3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-768" title="sig-sanders" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sig-sanders3.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>Today&#8217;s Provocation strays ever so slightly off our April theme, but I hope you&#8217;ll follow along anyway. I&#8217;m going to lay out my some of my own ideas on turning <em>delivered</em> cues into <em>demo</em> cues. My overall opinion: if you want to put your best musical foot forward, there&#8217;s work to be done. Potentially <em>lots</em> of work.<br />
<a name="more"></a><br />
Let&#8217;s start here: when we&#8217;re delivering cues for a film mix, or even for network television, we tend to allow the dynamics to &#8220;breathe&#8221; much more than we would if we were producing them for an album release. In fact, I think the extra attention to mastering detail at the album stage is something that sets guys like Hans Zimmer and his Remote Control colleagues apart from many other established, respected composers… even A-list folks.</p>
<p>If you could hear, side by side, the album version and the &#8220;in-film&#8221; version of some of the Remote Control guys&#8217; scores, I suspect you&#8217;d notice <em>substantial</em> differences.</p>
<p>First off, the album-version cues are limited and tweaked to within an inch of their lives. The waveforms resemble what you&#8217;d see on commercial albums by recording artists… thick black blocks. A super-full sonic spectrum. This isn&#8217;t normally what you want to deliver to a dub stage—even in the fairly rare event you&#8217;re delivering full mixes in the first place.</p>
<p>So, for me, <strong>Step One is re-thinking the mix concept.</strong> That might mean going back to the original sequence file or Pro Tools session and starting more or less from scratch. In my view it&#8217;s worth it—the goal of what you&#8217;re creating at this stage is entirely different from its original purpose, so re-conceptualizing your mix makes a lot of sense. It also forces you to evaluate exactly which cues are worth the effort—sort of pre-selecting your favorites to go into the Demo Bin.</p>
<p>Along those same lines comes <strong>Step Two: editing for content.</strong> I think of a demo CD as a carnival ride… which the listener can get off of at any point. Your job is to keep them on that ride. Manipulate their attention span so that there&#8217;s something new and interesting every few seconds, while at the same time maintaining the overall musical integrity of the cue.</p>
<p>This is one of those areas where you can apply as much or as little time and energy as you have to spare. Honestly—by the time you experiment with different mixouts, different shapes, moving sections around in sequence, combining two or more cues into a single cue, etc., there are instances when you might as well start from scratch entirely (at least it often feels that way!).</p>
<p>Also, some cues just prove impervious to cutting. In those cases it&#8217;s time to make a command decision whether to accept the cue as-is or chuck it out of the Demo Bin entirely.</p>
<p>So… here&#8217;s one of the Big Questions people often debate: how long should a demo cue be? The answer is really a part of your own personal musical aesthetic—and I don&#8217;t know that, inside a certain reasonable musical-duration ballpark, there&#8217;s really a wrong answer. One of my own pet peeves is demos that contain only one loooong track (I&#8217;ve received a few). They&#8217;re gonna <em>make</em> me listen to that whole thing one way or another! Except, you know, I don&#8217;t. Filmmakers like to be able to fast forward if what they&#8217;re hearing isn&#8217;t interesting. It&#8217;s not a bad thing, I think, to give them the opportunity to do this (and thus to get to something they might like better!).</p>
<p>Next up: if your demo consists entirely of cues from a single project, you should take <strong>Step Three: considering track order</strong>, just as you would any other kind of demo CD. This may sound obvious, but I&#8217;ve had the following conversation on several occasions:</p>
<p><em><strong>Aspiring Composer:</strong></em><strong> </strong>&#8220;So… what did you think of my demo?&#8221;<br />
<em><strong>LHS:</strong></em> &#8220;Well, [other, unrelated comments]. And I would have put that first track later… maybe third. Take the fourth track and put it up front—&#8221;<br />
<strong><em>AC:</em></strong> (interrupting, slightly rudely): &#8220;—But the first track is the Main Title! The whole thing is in chronological order; I&#8217;m telling the story the way it was in the film—&#8221;<br />
<strong><em>LHS:</em></strong> (returning the favor with my own rude interruption): &#8220;—And I don&#8217;t care what the order was in the film. I think moving things around makes for a better ride.&#8221;<br />
<strong><em>AC:</em></strong> &#8220;Hmm.&#8221; (delivered in that tone of voice that means there&#8217;s no way this particular piece of advice is going to occupy any more of AC&#8217;s head space, and now AC is wondering where the nearest Starbucks might be located).</p>
<p>Do what you want with track order… but I encourage you not to set arbitrary limits. And I consider &#8220;that&#8217;s the way they appeared in the picture&#8221; to be arbitrary.</p>
<p>Finally, it&#8217;s time for <strong>Step Four: naming your cues</strong>. &#8220;1m21&#8221; isn&#8217;t gonna cut it, and unless you&#8217;ve already come up with something clever (say, in the spotting session), now&#8217;s the time to think of some really evocative titles. Again, for some reason people send me demos. The ones whose cue titles are most interesting tend to be the ones I&#8217;m most excited to hear. Simple as that.</p>
<p>If I read &#8220;Chase&#8221; or &#8220;Comedy,&#8221; I&#8217;m expecting something as generic and vanilla as its title suggests. I don&#8217;t mean to suggest that you have to put undue strain on your thesaurus for this, but it&#8217;s one of those attention-to-detail things that might make your demo ever so slightly more interesting to a listener… and that, in my opinion, makes it worth the stretch.</p>
<p>This weekend&#8217;s column isn&#8217;t intended to be my Last Word on making demos… but I hope it&#8217;s reminded you of how important it is to treat them as their own thing, rather than just copy/pasting your film-dub versions onto a CD playlist. The difference requires more effort and hassle—in some cases, a lot more—but it&#8217;s worth it.</p>
<p>If you have any other tricks or tips on this, let&#8217;s talk… hit the COMMENTS. Something I&#8217;ve left out? Something you disagree with? I&#8217;d love to hear it. SCOREcast is only as vital as we <em>all</em> make it!</p>
