Getting to the bottom of something — to the core level of it — while utilizing the smallest amount of verbiage possible is something that I am profoundly fascinated with. It drives me crazy when someone is trying to make a point, and instead of stating the main crux of their position, they wax on with twenty minutes of preamble.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ll try my damnedest to make this intro quick and to the point.</p>
<p>I am supposed to talk to you today about &#8220;competition&#8221;, but I don&#8217;t want to, so I&#8217;m not going to. Instead, let&#8217;s talk about what the very core of the word &#8220;competition&#8221; boils down to: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>winning and losing</em></span>. And there&#8217;s a lot to talk about.<br />
<a name="more"></a><br />
Here&#8217;s the deal: Right this very second, as you sit wherever you are and read this post, one of two things is taking place in your life. You are either <em><strong>winning</strong></em> the game of being a successful working film composer, or you are <strong><em>losing</em></strong> it. It really IS that simple.</p>
<p>It is easy to lose at this gig. It doesn&#8217;t take much. If you are haughty enough to think you can simply make it on talent alone, you are losing already. Mark my words: Your disciplines, not your ability to put dots on a page, will be what determine whether you win or lose in this crowded film composing landscape. If you have the wherewithal to really dig into what makes a winner and what it takes to win consistently&#8230; you are well on your way to making a serious run at this thing.</p>
<p>If you know me personally or have spent any amount of time reading what I write here at SCO, you already know that I personally do not subscribe much to the &#8220;luck&#8221; speech you hear from most successful film composers. Sure, fortune plays a part, but I rather believe that it is a steady stream of hard-carved winning disciplines that moves a person closer to the place where fortune can smile upon them. To me, winning is not about being the best at the moment. Winning is about being the best over time.</p>
<p>Think about it this way: NBA legend Michael Jordan is a winner. But to Jordan, winning is clearly a life choice. Much like putting on his pants everyday or taking a shower. You just do it, but you do it through a combined effort of several &#8220;habits&#8221; that work together to birth the perfect long-term win. Over time, we&#8217;ve all come to view Michael Jordan as someone who just simply does not lose easily. And occasionally when he does lose, he goes back to basics and gets serious about those fundamental habits that will propel him toward his next victory.</p>
<p>With that said, let me share several disciplines that I consistently examine and re-examine of myself in order to insure that I am winning, and not losing, at this incredibly competitive game we call &#8220;Composing for Film and Television&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>DISCIPLINE #1: PURPOSE</strong><br />
<em>What is it that you like doing? If you don’t like it, get out of it, because you’ll be lousy at it. You don’t have to stay with a job for the rest of your life, because if you don’t like it you’ll never be successful in it. — Lee Iacocca</em></p>
<p>The day that you even have a fleeting thought that you aren&#8217;t having fun composing anymore is the day it&#8217;s time to get out.</p>
<p>For several of us, composing for film and TV is non-negotiable. We HAVE to do it. It is, as they say, in our blood. I am a musician at heart, but I do not get the sense of fulfillment by playing drums, piano, or violin the way that I do when I write music to picture. There is nothing that makes me feel quite like the act of writing score does. It is not something I can explain; it is not something I can define. It simply &#8220;is so&#8221;.</p>
<p>You might be passionate about other things in life that bring you joy in a way that scoring films cannot. If so, please take my word for it: You need to quit pursuing film music as a possible career choice. Game over. You&#8217;ve lost already. I don&#8217;t say this out of anything other than the fact that everyone should be happy and fulfilled in life, and believe me, doing something you are not 1000% charged up about won&#8217;t ever bring you that joy and fulfillment you are looking for. In fact it will create the opposite, with a little &#8220;wasted time&#8221; added in for good measure.</p>
<p>It is with this kind of supreme confidence that I start every day of my life. I was MEANT FOR THIS. There is nothing else BUT this. No matter how hard it gets, how crowded the market gets, how poor the economy gets, how miserable the industry becomes&#8230; no matter. I am here, I am a film composer&#8230; I WILL achieve and I WILL be victorious. I have no &#8220;Plan B&#8221;. I have no safety net. I have no choice. THIS is my career purpose.</p>
<p>Another part of this has to do with the strength of your &#8220;drive&#8221;. I know a person who wants to break into the entertainment industry, but at every opportunity, at every turn, he excuses himself from meeting socially with directors, producers, and executives, always with the reason of being &#8220;too tired from work&#8221;. Guess what? That&#8217;s a losing mentality, and it&#8217;s guys like me who cannot wait for people like him to say things like that so that I can come in, full of purpose, ideas, and solutions, and save the day.</p>
<p>The bottom line is you either mean to be here, or you don&#8217;t. There is no middle ground. There can&#8217;t be. It&#8217;s too competitive. There are winners and losers in this, and winners are here out of necessity. Losers are here temporarily.</p>
<p><strong>DISCIPLINE #2: ORIGINALITY</strong><br />
<em>I am not looking like Armani today and somebody else tomorrow. I look like Ralph Lauren. And my goal is to constantly move in fashion and move in style without giving up what I am. — Ralph Lauren</em></p>
<p>Nobody is looking for a clone of a new fad. They might think that will work, but if a person is presented with two choices, one being a carbon copy of the latest and greatest and the second a fresh, powerful, revolutionary idea, they will always choose the latter. This is a tested principle that has held true throughout the history of the world.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>People desire to be first.</em></span></p>
<p>This goes for studio executives, also. I know you&#8217;ve heard the horror stories of composers being &#8220;forced&#8221; to rewrite the temp. But consider the possibility of a studio exec, under pressure from stockholders to keep things riding high, realizing half way through the scoring dates that their composer simply is not in the creative space to deliver a fresh idea like they hoped he would. Imagine the internal feeling of compromise that must be reached for a studio boss to come to the place of allowing that composer, because of basic financial and schedule economics, to just do what they &#8220;know will work&#8221;, and call it good.</p>
<p>This is NOT the fault of the studio executive. Sorry. You don&#8217;t get off that easy. No. This is the fault of the composer. It is OUR job to bring a fresh musical voice to every production. It is OUR job to create something, through the careful balance of tradition and forethought, that will support the picture in way that has never been heard before.</p>
<p>When you shortcut your creativity in the interest of time, finances, or for any other reason, you lose.<br />
<strong>DISCIPLINE #3: ORGANIZATION</strong><br />
<em>The object of this competition is not to be mean to the losers but to find a winner. The process makes you mean because you get frustrated. Kids turn up unrehearsed, wearing the wrong clothes, singing out of tune and you can either say, &#8220;Good job&#8221; and patronize them or tell them the truth, and sometimes the truth is perceived as mean. — Simon Cowell</em></p>
<p>Our industry is complex. As a film composer, the deck is already stacked against you from the moment your feet hit your bedroom floor everyday. Why then, would you ever poke the bear by not doing things that are elementary to the success of any business venture? I&#8217;m talking about things like not having materials ready; not remembering names; not researching meeting participants, etc.</p>
<p>All of these things are things that I have nailed down when I go into a meeting. I operate under the assumption that I&#8217;m up against the most rehearsed, prepared, organized person out there. THAT &#8220;superhuman&#8221; is my #1 threat. I will know every name associated with the project, every movie that each producer has worked on, each composer that the director has used before, the styles of the films that these people have completed in the past, and what kinds of stories this team likes to tell. Am I surprised every so often with something I didn&#8217;t anticipate? Of course. But I am so prepared that you&#8217;d never know it.</p>
<p>Imagine trying to beat The Terminator in a fist fight. No matter what you do, you are screwed, because through repetition and carefully calculated methodology, he is simply engineered to be better, stronger, and able to take more abuse than you ever could.</p>
<p>That is who you are up against. I hope you are ready.</p>
<p><strong>DISCIPLINE #4: DECISIVENESS</strong><br />
<em>Remember, a real decision is measured by the fact that you&#8217;ve taken new action. If there&#8217;s no action, you haven&#8217;t truly decided. — Anthony Robbins</em></p>
<p>If SCOREcast&#8217;s Lee Sanders has said it once, he&#8217;s said it a million times: <em>We are hired for our opinions</em>. And he&#8217;s right. Nobody cares about your music if you, as the composer, do not have a statement about why you did it that way. Sitting quietly in the corner, afraid to utter a word or join in the conversation is a career killer, and you really need to get over it.</p>
<p>In this town, people who are decision makers for THEIR companies have no time or tolerance for whiny little kiss-asses who are afraid to make a move one way or another for fear of screwing up. Even if it&#8217;s the wrong one, people would rather you just move at all.</p>
<p>I have zero trouble making large, key, career decisions. In fact, I have an easier time making a decision that will effect a multi-million dollar budget than I do deciding what shirt I am going to wear each morning. Your directors and producers are going to be counting on your ability to make key decisions under pressure. Work now to develop the habit of deciding. Do not allow the paranoia of making a mistake keep you from making decisions.</p>
<p>Also, make decisions quickly. Not hastily, but quickly. There is a difference. I don&#8217;t rush decisions — I think things through completely. Sometimes you have to &#8220;hurry up&#8221; and decide, but usually, there is zero need to do that. In fact, in most cases, the need for a rushed decision is merely poor planning on someone else&#8217;s part cloaked in urgency. Don&#8217;t fall prey to that. Car salesmen hate me with a passion because I don&#8217;t buy into their &#8220;the sky is falling unless you buy today&#8221; rhetoric. At the same time, I never over-analyze anything to the point of indecision. Operating like that cripples your ability to complete tasks. Being afraid of making the wrong decision can cripple your ability to be a leader in your field.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my next point&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>DISCIPLINE #5: LEADERSHIP</strong><br />
<em>Outstanding leaders go out of their way to boost the self-esteem of their personnel. If people believe in themselves, it&#8217;s amazing what they can accomplish. — Sam Walton</em></p>
<p>If you still think this is a solo career, you have been living in a very dark cave and it&#8217;s time to move. If there ever was an example of a career where strong leadership skills are becoming more and more crucial, it is that of the film and television composer.</p>
<p>However, it has always been taught that leadership is only an attribute of those who are at the top of the power pyramid. I would argue, instead, that a more modern paradigm of leadership could be a phenomenon that is so far-reaching that it also brings along those who are in higher positions of power than that of whom is doing the leading. I&#8217;ve been involved in countless organizations where the person who was elected the leader is obviously not the person who is in charge. In fact, sometimes, it is hard to know who to follow because on one side of the room you have the person who is the &#8220;designated&#8221; leader, but over here you have someone else whom everyone seems to want to follow. And of course, the person everyone is following IS the true leader.</p>
<p>I say all of this to say that if your leadership skills are strong, it is possible to lead in such a manner that those who are in positions of power way out of your paygrade will follow you also. Good leadership is a party people want to attend. It got our current President elected, and it is the reason why Donald Trump is where he is today. You might not agree with Obama&#8217;s politics, and you might think Trump needs to &#8220;fire&#8221; his hairdresser, but you cannot deny either man&#8217;s ability to get people charged up about something, so much so that they execute at an optimum level.</p>
<p>Leadership contains several key disciplines in and of itself. One of those disciplines is the ability to share credit, which is where I believe most composers start losing integrity. A lot of composers don&#8217;t like to share. And why should they? It&#8217;s hard out here for a pimp! We work long hours, for mediocre pay, with no guarantee of future gainful employment. We should get credit for every ounce of sweat equity that goes into our music, right?</p>
<p>But, we also know (and have discussed earlier) that film music has become a team sport, of sorts. No longer, except in the rare indie occurrence, does there still exist the film schedule that allows one enough time to go it alone. There are no Lone Rangers in film scoring. In all likeliness, you&#8217;ll have a team of people behind you that are pulling their weight in an effort that you might actually make that deadline on time and under budget. That team is brilliant, and more times than not, they&#8217;ll save your proverbial ass. You owe them more than just a paycheck. You owe them gratitude, you owe them public recognition for a job well done. Ultimately, you owe them a better gig somewhere else when the time is right.</p>
<p>Being a leader is about empowering others for THEIR sake, not yours. It is a selfless way of life. It is a giving, not a taking. Consequently, you may feel you are not in a place to lead just yet. I disagree. Leading isn&#8217;t circumstantial. It is elective. You either are leading, or you are following. Again, make up your mind which way you want to go, and go there. Just don&#8217;t expect people to follow you anywhere if you aren&#8217;t leading them somewhere.</p>
<p>Leadership is something that you might have to learn as time goes by. Some people are born with inherent leadership qualities, while others become time-tested leaders over a long period of years. Whatever the case, leadership always stars with one thing: Superior attitude.</p>
<p><strong>DISCIPLINE #6: ATTITUDE</strong><br />
<em>It is your attitude, not your aptitude, that determines your altitude. — Zig Ziglar</em></p>
<p>Your attitude is probably the most important distinguishing weapon in your competitive arsenal. It is the indicator by which you either decide to keep circling the track, or pull over for a pit stop of reassessment. I don&#8217;t want to give you the impression that I am some Superman who never gets discouraged and always has a smile on my face. That isn&#8217;t the case. Like everyone, I have my times in the desert and I go to THAT place of feeling like nothing is going right. But&#8230; it doesn&#8217;t last long.</p>
<p>My closest friends have heard me say &#8220;I took a dark day, but I&#8217;m back now!&#8221;, meaning that I allowed a single day to cry over my misfortunes, but keeping Discipline #1 in mind —  <em>this is what I do, no matter what</em> — it is a new day and I&#8217;m ready to climb back up on the horse again.</p>
<p>You cannot let obstacles and the trials of the world keep you down for more than a few hours. Yes — take time to realize the situation and personalize whatever lesson you need to learn out of it, but then&#8230; move on. In this particular case, all of the familiar cliches apply: There&#8217;s no use crying over spilled milk; It&#8217;s all water under the bridge; What done is done&#8230; blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>When you get knocked down, catch your breath, sleep on it, wake up, and start kicking ass again. And hey, if you don&#8217;t know where to start, find the nearest ass and start kicking! It&#8217;s not rocket science. There is always something to do. Better yet, if you are out of it from a knock down, write some music. If you are truly pursuing this career (there we are back to that Discipline #1 again!), then there is no better way to get back into a solid routine then to write.</p>
<p>It is only when you give permission to outside influences to hinder your goals that you begin to believe that you are not going to be able to continue. It is all about what you give way to. Part of me maintaining a winning attitude is surrounding myself with others winners. Aside from family, I have two sets of people in my life: Friends and pals. Pals are people that I know, maybe I see them from time to time around town at functions, in social situations.</p>
<p>Friends, though&#8230; those are the people in my inner circle. The people that I believe in and they believe in me. The Friends circle is a limited crew &#8211; Lee Sanders is one of those people. So is my manager and SCO&#8217;s David Fluhr. All of them winners. People who are making things happen and do not allow their lives to fall as it might. I&#8217;ve been careful to cultivate this group and to not allow those that do not belong into the fold. And let me be clear — it&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t spend time with people outside of that circle — I do. But I also have a select group of people that I consider my &#8220;Board of Directors&#8221; — the people that I know I could trust with my life — and they are the ones that I spend the majority of my time with. In these people, I see traits and characteristics that I long to improve upon in my own life, and by watching and learning from them, I can gain insights into how I might go about that.</p>
<p>Using these folks&#8217; attitudes and opinions toward my own tough issues is what helps me keep my attitude in check. All of these people also strive to keep their attitudes positive, and believe me&#8230;. misery loves company! If you surround yourself with other positive attitudes, yours will stay high for longer periods of time, too<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>DISCIPLINE #7: ADAPTABILITY</strong><br />
<em>It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change. — Charles Darwin</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve officially grown tired of hearing about &#8220;how much better things were thirty years ago&#8221;.</p>
<p>Who cares? I couldn&#8217;t tell ya. But I can and will tell you who doesn&#8217;t give a damn: <em>Directors and producers</em>. You know&#8230; the ones who sign the checks!</p>
<p>As composers, by now we are all very aware of how easy it has become for almost anybody to acquire some gear and create a film score that is good enough by today&#8217;s standards. All it takes is a little bit of musical knowledge, a sliver of filmic understanding, a hard drive of loops, and a laptop, and you can basically fashion one together. It might not be great and it might not win any awards, but it will work in a lot of the stuff that&#8217;s going to DVD today.</p>
<p>That, my friends, is the state of our industry. There is nothing to be done that will change that. In fact, it will get worse with time. As with all things in a technological field (which, by the way, film music has fallen under ever since the very first day that someone decided to mechanically sync it to film), the process by which film music is created will continue to be dumbed down, based on the understanding of traditional practices.</p>
<p>I believe it is important to stop here and note that I didn&#8217;t say that &#8220;film music&#8221; will be dumbed down. Only the manner by which we create it.</p>
<p>This means that unless you are willing to embrace where film music creation might be headed, you are going to experience a slow and irrelevant extinction, just like celluloid and magnetic tape is experiencing right now. It is those who embrace the future of film music creation that will ultimately make it through to the next round of film music success. You can long for the old &#8220;Golden Days&#8221; of film scoring all you want, but they are NEVER coming back. It doesn&#8217;t matter what we do — stronger education, less composers in the field, better rates, smarter royalty collection systems — none of these things will ever stop the inevitable force of progress that essentially is eroding the way this gig used to get done.</p>
<p>You need to decide right here and now if you are going to be a forward-thinker&#8230; or a nostalgic crybaby. One will get you to the next level and one won&#8217;t. If you take a look at most people who live winning lives, you&#8217;ll notice that they embrace change, in all parts of life. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it is at home, work, the gym, the finances, the power structure, government&#8230; whatever. The point is that things are always in constant flux&#8230; if you don&#8217;t flex with them, you will eventually become obsolete and be left behind.</p>
<p>Composers are no different. For us, all it takes is a look around at the composers who were able to make the leap from analog to digital. There are a number of composers who were simply unable or unwilling to adapt to the newer methods of digital recording from about 1984 to 1993, and consequently, they are either no longer scoring the modern motion picture or their creative output over the last decade has significantly tapered as a result.</p>
<p>If you are a &#8220;wisher&#8221;, figure out why. And then stop it. You cannot maneuver forward while constantly looking backward. Glance toward the past every now and again to avoid repeating mistakes, but keep your eyes trained on the road ahead. Technology, techniques, methods, and the competition will always move forward — with or without you. The choice is yours.</p>
<p><strong>DISCIPLINE #8: LEGACY</strong><br />
<em>If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. — Dolly Parton</em></p>
<p>My former assistant, SCO&#8217;s Jai Meghan, has worked with some of the best composers in Hollywood. When he came to me in 2007, the first thing I asked him was &#8220;Why in the hell are you here?&#8221; He had been at Zimmer&#8217;s, worked with Graeme Revell and Harry Gregson-Williams, and learned from some of the best in this business. I couldn&#8217;t understand how he ended up on my door from all of those other places of employment. As we worked together over the two years that followed, I came to realize that although Jai had learned a lot from those guys, for him, that time was over. Now he wanted to know how Deane Ogden did it. And while I don&#8217;t believe I wield any magic wand for doing this gig, there definitely IS a method to my madness. And the method is all mine.</p>
<p>When I leave this planet, I want to be remembered only as a man who left film music better than I found it. If I can improve upon the craft, even in the slightest, I&#8217;ll be satisfied. I don&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;ll invent some undiscovered mode or unlock a never before heard scale or progression, but I simply mean that I want to be a composer who utilized my knowledge of film and music in a way never before imagined by anyone else.</p>
<p>This might be controversial to say, but I&#8217;ve never thought of the Beatles as a group that invented anything new, rather than revolutionizing something that had been around awhile. Elvis Presley didn&#8217;t come up with anything unheard of, he simply polished it up and bundled it in a form that was fresh and relevant for a generation that craved it&#8217;s own musical identity.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all we can do as film composers. The greats of our craft that have gone before us have done all of the magic that can ever be done with a baton. It is now up to us — the new generation — to pick up where they left off and conceive of fresh and unexplored approaches to the traditional devices of film music.</p>
<p>To me, these things are what REAL competition is all about. To me, competing isn&#8217;t about who&#8217;s better or who gets the gig. It&#8217;s about what you do with the gig once you DO get it. What do you print to disk when all is said and done.</p>
<p>Are you a strong decision maker? Are you able to make changes on the fly? Are you a hungrier entrepreneur? Are you an empowering leader?</p>
<p>These are the things that will separate you from the pack. These practices will be the ones that shape your &#8220;competitive spirit&#8221; in the fight for gigs.</p>
<p>Stack us all up against each other, and we are pretty much musically interchangeable.</p>
<p>But stack us up in these areas of competitive discipline, and one of us will ultimately come out the victor.</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s it gonna be? Let the REAL competition begin!</p>
