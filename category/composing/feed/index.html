		<description><![CDATA[Is it possible to write in such a way that your music never sounds dated?]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m totally (!) a child of &#8220;retro&#8221;. I love old cheapo synthesizers, Stephen J. Cannell shows, and crappy-ADR&#8217;d eighties bombastic cinema. In fact, the cheesier it is, the more I&#8217;m probably going to like it.</p>
<p>As I get a little more &#8220;edumacated&#8221;, however, I am finding that all of those things, as <em>cool</em> as they seemed when I was little, aren&#8217;t the least bit <em>cool</em> now. And why? Well, sadly, most of them were a product of the consumer machine that much of our society is still chugging away at today, it&#8217;s just that back then it all looked a little more unsophisticated, a little more raw and rough. But still, it&#8217;s the same machine, and because I was younger I bought into it. In reality, most of that stuff has not stood the test of time, and now, when the opportunity comes to try and get back into it, I can&#8217;t go there.</p>
<p>Here is a sad, very sad example: <em>Commando</em> was on a few days ago on Cinemax Action. Now, I&#8217;ve always loved old Schwarzenegger movies. They&#8217;re a complete riot. But after I finished laughing at Ahnold&#8217;s silly one-liners, the weight of just how goofy a film like <em>Commando</em> is nowadays was too much for me to bear. I was crushed. &#8220;Dammit,&#8221; I thought to myself. &#8220;This movie was so damned&#8217; cool! Sully&#8217;s demise was so much funnier on Laserdisc than it is on Skin-emax! What the hell happened?&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Time</em>, man. <em>TIME</em> happened. Time is the &#8220;cool&#8221; killer—the <em>cool</em> <em>disintegrator</em>. The recipe that made shows like <em>Commando</em> so cool back in the day consisted of one cool effect after another, layer upon layer of &#8220;cool&#8221;. Now, though, layers and layers of what <em>was</em> cool no longer make any sense in the context of our &#8220;economy of cool&#8221;. Again, it&#8217;s a <em>time</em> thing. The film is dated now, to the point of it literally being just one big fat gigantic ridiculous mess of &#8220;uncool&#8221;.</p>
<p>The same happens today, only with CGI. Films like <em>G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra</em> and the remake of <em>Clash of the Titans</em> might have been amazingly creative had the filmmakers not gone for the cheap thrill by just stringing together one CGI set-piece after another, until the film finally feels like one big giant ridiculous mess of, yes&#8230; <em>uncool</em>. In twenty years, movie-making will have gone through several more incarnations of &#8220;cool&#8221;, and we&#8217;ll be having this conversation again, except we&#8217;ll be talking about <em>Avatar</em>. Is it cool? Of course. But, emphasis on &#8220;is&#8221;. &#8220;Is&#8221; is <em>current</em>. <em>Will it be cool?</em> is a question that can only be answered later on.</p>
<p>The question, then, becomes, &#8220;What kinds of things remain &#8220;cool&#8221; no matter what <em>time</em> has to say about them?&#8221; Well, one could argue that &#8220;story&#8221; is still cool. Personally, I don&#8217;t like animated films, but the storylines in most <em>Pixar</em> films are unarguably at least half of what makes them so successful. <em>Toy Story 3</em> might not look as amazing in twenty years as it did this summer because the technology will have changed so drastically by then, but my bet is that the storyline of the film will still be cool enough to choke up a new generation of viewers.</p>
<p>In the context of film music, we could observe the same effectual deterioration of our artform. Harmonic theory and melody have given way, in a lot of cases, to drones and the recently popular, yet musically ambiguous &#8220;ambient music design&#8221;. It takes a little doing these days to find a score for a popular tentpole that isn&#8217;t reliant on pads and drones—&#8221;atmospheric&#8221; is the buzzword I keep hearing around the studio I work at. It feels like people are a little more concerned sometimes with being &#8220;cool&#8221; with their choices of sounds and atmospheres (there&#8217;s <em>that</em> word again!) and less &#8220;cool&#8221;, or &#8220;creative&#8221;, in making sure that they figure a unique way to write for a character or story point. All but lost is the art of creating something uniquely suited to a character or story point in the narrative from a &#8220;aural&#8221; perspective.</p>
<p>I wonder what would happen if we, as composers, focused less on being &#8220;cool&#8221; and more on being &#8220;creative&#8221;? Would we need to give the &#8220;Best Picture&#8221; treatment to composers at the Oscars and expand the &#8220;Best Score&#8221; category to ten nominations as well? Would there be so many killer melodic scores with outstanding orchestration that we&#8217;d have trouble choosing? Would the line between &#8220;sound design&#8221; and &#8220;score&#8221; become even more clear, as sound designers would be more free to create without fear that the composer was going to cover it all up with <em>atmosphere</em>?</p>
<p>What does that mean to you in your work? How can you be less <em>cool</em> and more <em>creative</em>? What are YOUR personal definitions of &#8220;uncool&#8221; and how do you carefully navigate around them in your work?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Composers LOVE to say that they use all of their own sounds. We call B.S.!]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In what many consider to be the Bible of film composing, Fred Karlin’s “<a href="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=scon0d-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=0415941369&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;m=amazon&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr" target="_blank">On the Track</a>” (affliliate link), Jerry Goldsmith is quoted as saying that he was “never embarrassed to use a factory preset”. In interviews, Danny Elfman has mentioned that he used StormDrum 2 extensively on his “Terminator Salvation” score. In several network television shows that are currently airing, you will hear many familiar Omnisphere, Symphobia, and Reaktor patches morphing and wafting their way through the sonic fabric.</p>
<p>Amongst composers, “I design all my own sounds” seems to be a phrase that we like to use. Of course, we cannot be JUST LIKE everyone else, right? However, if you are a composer yourself, then you know the intrinsic value of not having to reinvent the wheel on every single project you take on. With abbreviated schedules being what they are nowadays, who has the time?</p>
<p>That being said, what sounds do you feel get overused? What sounds do you think are now dated and need to be retired? What priority do you place on original sound design, and how do you feel about organic sound design versus ready-made presets from top sound designers in the form of packaged collections?</p>
<p>Furthermore, is original sound design in film scoring (sometimes referred to as &#8220;score design&#8221;) still a necessary step in the creation of a medium that could essentially be scheduled out to only a few weeks? Do you find that you have the time it takes to truly &#8220;design&#8221; original sounds for the films you score?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I don't know John, and he doesn't know me. Which is good... I don't want him to.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is a simple fact: None of us are the same.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never have to worry about competing with John Williams. I know what you are thinking: &#8220;NO shit!&#8221;</p>
<p>No, I mean it. John Williams will never sound like I can. He&#8217;s not able. You might say, &#8220;Um, Deane, excuse me, but John Williams is arguably the single greatest composer living today. He can do anything.&#8221; To which I respond, &#8220;Yes he is&#8230; and no he cannot.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Williams can never be Deane Ogden, or James Newton Howard, or Alain Mayrand, or John Debney, or Brian Ralston, or Alexandre Desplat, or Sharon Farber, or Chris Young, or Adrian Ellis, or Hans Zimmer, or Brian Satterwhite, or Richard Bellis, or Tim Montijo, or Alan Silvestri. As long as he has written for the screen, as hard as he might try, as much as he may study, he&#8217;ll never get there. Our music flows from a place that John Williams could never understand or even come close to comprehending. He could not possibly get it and he never will.</p>
<p>Conversely, as hard as <em>we</em> try, as hard as <em>we</em> study, and as hard as <em>we</em> practice, <em>we</em> will never sound like John Williams. John Williams never has to worry you nor I. Why? Because none of us could ever fathom what John Williams had to go through to write his most recent note. We will never know what place that John Williams writes from. We don&#8217;t <em>get</em> him, and we never ever will.</p>
<p>We are all different people with different lives, different sets of experiences, born of different parents, facing radically different futures. Therefore, <em>competition</em>, at least in the form by which we usually refer to it, doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>People talk about <em>competition</em> all the time. I hear constantly from players how hard it is to compete with the convenience of samples (not the <em>quality</em> of them&#8230;. the <em>convenience</em> of them—I feel the letters from the AFM on their way to me already!). Of course, we all have experienced the &#8220;competition&#8221; within our own ranks—being put up against each other by our own representative agencies for projects, always with that same reassurance from them, &#8220;Hey don&#8217;t worry&#8230; this one&#8217;s got YOU written all over it!&#8221; Uh huh.</p>
<p>Professional golfers say often that there is no competition amongst their tribe, but rather only that which exists between each golfer and the golf course itself. To a pro golfer, the other golfer on the course is not the competitor, but the curve of a fairway or the placement of a hazard. I&#8217;ve always found that concept fascinating and I&#8217;ve often pondered how it might apply to our situation as music and film Creatives. There really is no one entity in the film music community that you need ever have to worry about competing with, save for one&#8230; your own <em>music</em>. Yes, the most fierce competition out there that you&#8217;ll face as a composer is the last score you wrote. Your true nemesis resides right there, in the pit of your own stomach—the drive to better yourself. To set a goal, achieve it, set a loftier goal, achieve that, and so on, and so forth. Creatives have it in their guts to up their own ante. As Creatives, we are our own fiercest competition, our own worst enemies.</p>
<p>Creatives are different than other people. It&#8217;s politically correct to say that we aren&#8217;t—that we are just like construction workers, attorneys, corporate buyers, or police officers—but when you get honest about it, we most certainly AREN&#8217;T like any of those people. We are a different animal. We don&#8217;t think, analyze, opine, or expend our energy the way non-creatives do. We also don&#8217;t rest, work, vacation, engage, or &#8220;unplug&#8221; the way that non-creatives do. We rarely ever stop creating, whether we are writing at our workstations or writing in our heads at the dinner table. We often get accused of not being &#8220;present&#8221; during conversations or engaged in our surroundings (sound familiar?). We daydream a lot. We also have a greater need for solitude and seclusion and often are told that we lean towards being &#8220;reclusive&#8221;. By all counts, we are simply <em>different</em>. And what drives us is different, also.</p>
<p>Creatives are <em>driven</em> in a way that no other human tribe is. We are driven to create, yet in that process of creating—when we are really <em>down in it</em>— composers in particular tend to lose track of something that is vital to long-term success: Self-Improvement. So many composers—even the A-listers who some view as &#8220;leading the pack&#8221; in terms of pushing the boundaries of the craft—rely on their same old bag of tricks, their tried-and-true methods of creating&#8230; the things that have always worked for them. The crutches. The old standards. The &#8220;reliables&#8221;.</p>
<p>It gets worse as you move up the ladder. I recently sat with an A-list composer friend of mine and we talked about the differences between the terraces of the film composing career. We talked about the contrasts of handling 1-2 million dollar studio budgets versus 30-90k indie budgets, managing a team of 25 versus an army of One, and working with our agencies as opposed to negotiating our own deals. But when we started talking <em>creativity</em>, I ask him what the major differences were that he saw between his A-list position and when he first started out as an indie film guy. Here&#8217;s what he said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>&#8220;Deane, when you have done this as long as I&#8217;ve been fortunate to, you develop a sound. And that sound is what you then become known for. Once you have your sound, in a strange way, it&#8217;s over for you creatively. That&#8217;s all they want. That sound. You don&#8217;t get to experiment, they don&#8217;t want you to try anything new. They just want the sound. Then it is up to you. You have to then figure out a way to manipulate that sound—the sound that is YOU—so that it evolves and changes, yet to them, it is still that sound. But to you, it becomes something else. Something different every time. And it&#8217;s always got to be better than the last time, because if it&#8217;s not, then what&#8217;s the point for you? If you aren&#8217;t doing better work each and every time you score a picture, you are cheating yourself and at that point it really is just a service job. It&#8217;s heartless, then. No life. I&#8217;m not saying that&#8217;s easy, Deane. Getting to the point of besting yourself each time out is a hard thing to do, and most composers haven&#8217;t figured out how to do it. But it is possible if you work at it. But that&#8217;s the rub—it takes a lot of patience and a lot of hard work.&#8221;<br />
</em></p>
<h1>The Passion to Be <em>You</em></h1>
<p>Finding your own voice—or as my friend put it&#8230; <em>&#8220;the sound&#8221;</em>—can be daunting at best and impossible at worst. What IS your sound? Is it something you can just conjure up, or must it come to you organically, born out of &#8220;doing&#8221; film music for long periods of time? Who knows. It&#8217;s probably different for everybody. But certainly, the commonality exists that you must be conscious of it before you set out to be original. In doing so, however, be careful not to set out to be <em>different from everyone else</em>. If you do, you&#8217;ll be looking at others more than you should be. When you focus too much on outside factors, you begin to lose track of what you are trying to accomplish in your own craft.</p>
<p>Exerting effort to be better than the next person will get you nowhere. Well&#8230; that&#8217;s not entirely true&#8230; it <em>will</em> get you <em>somewhere</em>, but <em>somewhere</em> is a place that you won&#8217;t like very much. Better to concentrate instead on besting yourself. You&#8217;ll never be better than John Williams at what he does. Williams is the best Williams there is. You&#8217;ll never do Tom Newman better than Tom Newman does Tom Newman. I&#8217;m not talking about not having to &#8220;live up&#8221; to the temp, or having to create something with the same vibe as what the director has been infatuated with since the beginning of post. In fact, I believe that &#8220;temp love&#8221; is less about the <em>music</em> and more about the <em>feeling</em> of the scene. (There has never been a situation in my own career when I wasn&#8217;t able to talk the director off the steep cliff of &#8220;recreating the temp&#8221;. It&#8217;s easy to do if you can articulate how the <em>music</em> is not really the issue—the <em>scene</em> is.)</p>
<p>What am I suggesting? Am I saying that competition isn&#8217;t productive? Of course not. What I&#8217;m saying is that competing against <em>yourself</em>—allowing your <em>own</em> brand of greatness to slowly unfold—is better than buzzing harder to keep up with the swarm.</p>
<p>Allow <em>your</em> music to do the talking.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[What to do when your organizable musical structure relies on a moving visual target.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jai Meghan&#8217;s recent Open Forum Friday <a href="../../../2010/10/open-forum-friday-getting-organized.html" target="_blank">article</a> on &#8220;getting organized&#8221; got me thinking about a <em>different</em> way of organizing: How composers organize their ideas within a piece of music. According to Wikipedia the word &#8220;composer&#8221; comes from the Latin <em>compônere</em>, meaning &#8220;one who puts together&#8221;. In a sense, composing a piece of music is really about <em>organizing</em>—organizing notes into themes and melodies, melodies into phrases, phrases into coherent sections, and so on.</p>
<p>The Classical forms like Rondo, Sonata, Compound Ternary, etc. all serve as extremely useful road-maps for developing musical material. The Rondo form, for example (ie. ABACA), gives us a blueprint for balancing a main theme with contrasting sections. After the main theme we have a contrasting section, and after every contrasting section we return to the main theme. Thus, the perfect sense of coherence and unity by repetitions of the main theme, balanced by variety and interest from the contrasting sections.</p>
<p>All of this is great to know when you&#8217;re sitting down to write a new composition to be performed in a concert hall. But how does this information stay relevant when scoring to picture? What do you do when your entire musical structure depends on the visual?</p>
<p>Picture is king. Even if you are struck with inspiration and would love nothing more than to have your main theme run off into a fugue, you&#8217;re not entirely in charge. If it doesn&#8217;t support the picture, it doesn&#8217;t make the score.</p>
<p>As you have probably already experienced either in your own scores or while watching other films, sometimes it doesn&#8217;t take much for the music to be dramatically effective. Even just a slowly thumping bass drum can be enough to support the picture in a compelling way. Where are the balanced sections in that cue? The audience isn&#8217;t particularly interested in how you transitioned from the B section back to the main theme, they&#8217;re interested in what&#8217;s happening on screen.</p>
<p>It would seem that perhaps the classical forms are backwards thinking, while a film cue is forward thinking. The structured forms are about developing the material that you&#8217;ve already heard; the contrasting B section isn&#8217;t a contrast if you haven&#8217;t yet heard A. But film music seems to be more about the present and future moments, building tension and preparing (or in some cases defying) expectations.</p>
<p>If there is still a place for form in film music, perhaps it&#8217;s only in those places where the audience is actually paying attention to the music. In the main titles, for example, or a montage that is mostly score driven.</p>
<p>So what do you think? Is musical form relevant when writing to picture? Are the traditional methods of organizing musical material still useful in the world of film scoring?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[There are 12 tones, and only so much you can do. Right, James Horner?]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>James Horner once said, &#8220;There are only 12 tones. There&#8217;s only so much you can do.&#8221; Interesting theory, but is it true? Some of you will say that Horner is just lazy. Hmm. Others will say, &#8220;He has a point: Perhaps that&#8217;s why much of the film music we hear today seems a bit derivative.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whichever, his comment raises a pertinent question amongst Creatives: Is there a limit to what can be created from an <em>original</em> place?</p>
<p>Indeed, what constitutes &#8220;originality&#8221;? To take it a step further, what makes for a truly <em>original film score</em>? Is it the sound? The composer? The approach? The use of instruments? Or none of the above&#8230; or ALL of the above? Why do you feel the way you do about your take on it?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Things film composers are doing <em>wrong</em> lately, and how to avoid developing the same habits.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m going to stray from the recent focus on &#8220;Working as a Team&#8221; and devote a few posts to some of the things I’ve observed film composers doing <em>wrong</em> lately. Of course, that statement in and of itself is highly subjective, but I think there are some habits that are starting to trend that, while possibly not evident right away, will prove down the line to be detrimental to doing business as a film composer in our continually evolving market.</p>
<p>I’m not talking about poor business acumen: not returning phone calls, showing up late, under-delivering or running over-budget. To be honest, if you are doing any of those things you are already dead in the water! Instead, what I’ll be referring to are things that <a title="July 2010: Marketing and Branding" href="../../../2010/07" target="_blank">July’</a>s theme of “Marketing and Branding” got me thinking about, and I’ll split them up into a series of posts I’m going to call “Caveats of Convenient Film Composing”. I see this list of choices as “temptations of convenience”. This series might also be called “The Seduction of The Easy Way Out”. In this economy and composing climate, I see a lot of composers taking these routes. While none of them are necessarily “bad”, I&#8217;ll try to make the case as to why I believe most of them should be avoided.</p>
<h1>Caveat #1: Catering To The Crowd</h1>
<p>We’ve said this before at SCOREcast (and I’m sure you’ve it heard elsewhere, too): you aren’t going to get rich being a film composer. Moreover, you certainly aren’t going to get “noticed” or get famous being one… save for the film music lovers in the world. And there are enough of them to make you think you might!</p>
<p>In fact, I am hearing more film scores come out that sound like they were written with film music fans in mind from the start. I’m not talking about CD soundtrack albums—those *should* be sequences for a good listen. I’m referring to the actual music in the film. As film music becomes more and more popular (the result of increased academic attention on film scoring combined with the glut of composers trying to fight their way onto the playing field) we are seeing the value of film music being placed more on the “soundtrack release”, and the hopeful (if not fruitless) rewards reaped thereof rather than the accomplishment of a score being perfectly tailored to the action onscreen.</p>
<p>Likewise, social media has introduced new frontiers never before discovered in how film music people are connected around the world. New film music festivals such as the incredible <a href="http://festival.bsospirit.com/" target="_blank">Ubeda International Music Festival</a>, <a title="South by Southwest" href="http://www.sxsw.com/" target="_blank">SXSW</a>, and even the <a href="http://www.soundtrackfilmfestival.com/" target="_blank">Soundtrack Film Music Festival</a> raise awareness of our craft in a way that was never really possible before the level of connection that social media tools like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and MySpace provide. However, that connection of convenience comes with a small price tag: composers writing for the “admission” into those events instead of writing the best score they can for the film. I was asked to be a guest adjudicator at a festival last year where one of the awards given out was a “Hardest Working Composer” award of sorts, and the criteria by which it was awarded was based on how many scores that composer had produced in a single year. I didn’t vote for the person who ultimately won the award, and I won’t mention how utterly wrong many of this person’s scores were for the films in which they “accompanied”. The award was obviously given for sheer “output” rather than any strict adherence to quality, function, or craft standards.</p>
<p>As a result, we might be hearing more and more music that sounds unoriginal and unfinished. John Debney recently invited some lively discussion by posing the question, “Why do so many scores sound absolutely the same these days?” Of the 128 respondents, most blamed the studios/producers for the lack of originality in film scoring today. I believe, however, that the studios want just as much to hear something creatively original as those of us doing the composing long to bring it to them. These days, composers are considering more than simply servicing the film when they write their scores, and it might be showing.</p>
<p>Danny Elfman has been criticized over the years of turning out scores that do not necessarily provide for a great listening experience independent of the film they were scored for. To that I say, &#8220;Perfect!&#8221; Do you think Mr. Elfman gives a hoot about whether or not his music works outside of the picture? I assure you, he doesn’t. And you shouldn&#8217;t either. No accolades, awards, reviews, or journalistic opinions could ever substitute for a well-written score tailor-made for the story by which it intends to serve.  To be a &#8220;good&#8221; composer (I&#8217;m not even talking <em>great</em> here… just <em>good</em>) you must come to the realization that you are there to do one single thing: service the film. That&#8217;s it. If you are aiming for any more than that in your duties then you are not fulfilling your duties at all. In fact, you are wasting your client&#8217;s, the studio&#8217;s, and your team&#8217;s valuable time. You are hunting for something more than what the job entails… you are hunting for a trophy. At that point, not only are you out of the flow of creativity, but you are also self-servingly seeking to gain something without truly putting your heart and soul into the work required to attain it.</p>
<p>My challenge? THROW yourself into your next project with reckless abandon. Don&#8217;t settle. Write music that you never knew was in you. Do not take your job lightly. Do not cut corners or take shortcuts. Do not rely on old, tired, and familiar devices, progressions, melodies, or motifs. In short, don&#8217;t make it easy on yourself. Challenge yourself to write bigger, better, and smarter. Orchestrate from a passionate place, not from an educational one. Voice your music with a new clarity and not with the palette you voiced from the last time or two. Do something different. If your principals are not sold on it, get off your ass and sell them on it! Convince them that this is the way to go if you know in your heart that it is what is best for the film. Instead of writing like it is the<em> first score</em> you&#8217;ll ever be recognized for, write as if it is the <em>last score</em> you&#8217;ll ever write. Everything else will take care of itself.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Setting a solid <i>starting strategy</i> for when it's time to create the music.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are certain elements of the process of finding and landing the gig that I really like. I may have a different view on this then other composers, but for myself, it’s part of what makes this whole film scoring business enjoyable. I find it interesting to search for prospective projects, whether at a networking events with filmmakers or through online networking like Facebook or Twitter. Making the connection, seeing if what I have to offer as a composer is what they would like and then, working with the a new filmmaker &#8211; it’s all great! Sometimes this takes weeks, months or maybe even years for something to develop, but it’s fascinating to set the wheels in motion and then see what unfolds. It&#8217;s also exciting when a new project comes in and it’s time to create the music.</p>
<p><strong>The Instrument</strong><br />
Everyone has a different way for starting a new music score. For myself, I find that my best ideas for a theme can be articulated on the piano.</p>
<p>I have a grand piano in my living room as well as a studio with an upright piano, keyboards, computers, and recording equipment.</p>
<p>It’s the grand that gives me the inspiration that I need to get a project started. It has a rich tone and I love playing it.  Sometimes, when there is a quick deadline, I will begin with the sequencer and keyboard in my studio, but I usually end up back at the acoustic piano to really hone the ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Theme, Melody, Tune: Where To Start?</strong><br />
I’ve heard some composers have music playing in their heads all the time, but tunes are not always flowing through my mind.  I have to actually start composing and thinking about the music before melodies become part of my conciseness.  I begin with improvising on the piano, carving out a melody with a 4 or 8 bar phrase with all the elements needed &#8211; intro, middle, conclusion. I struggle a lot when composing a theme. I will be at the piano for hours; I’ll leave the room, come back, work some more, hum the music from the theme I am composing, and I’ll keep doing this process until something develops. Humming or singing the melody really helps me work through places in a phrase that need clarity.  Another step I take is using the title of the film or names of characters to create musical patterns. This works sometimes, not always.<br />
For instance a theme I composed for a short film titled Mr. Chatterbox was based on the syllables of the title. This worked well and made the theme easy to write.</p>
<p>At the start of composing a theme, I tend to have too many notes in the initial theme, which is fine because it makes me weed out the notes that are unnecessary. I work with modifying the notes, not the length of the theme, changing interval relationships, leaving out notes and making the statement of music as clear as possible until it feels right to me. I may have a string of eighth notes in the theme and find that I can get to exactly the same place with fewer notes.</p>
<p><strong>The Wall</strong><br />
Things may go smoothly for a while, and then I will find that I can’t get what I want. I’m stuck. I’ve hit the wall, and I need help!  That’s when I go to great composers who’ve made beautiful themes and scores.<br />
I have a few composers that I turn to for thematic examples.  John William’s Schindler’s List, the violin solo, Ennio Morricone’s Cinema Paradiso ( I have the CD and find tons of inspiration in listening to it), and the second movement to Beethoven’s Piano Sonata Opus 13, often referred to as Pathetique. These three get me through hard spots when I am composing. I look at the interval relationship in the music and the harmonies that are used, play them, and think about how it all works. These compositions can get the creativity flowing again or I may have to take a real break for an hour or more.</p>
<p>I am definitely a composer that needs a completely different activity to recharge.  Walking the dog, taking a drive, attending a pilates class, doing something in a completely different location or space charges me right up. Then I can get back to composing again.</p>
<p>What happens if the theme just isn’t coming together no matter what you do? At that point I make a decision to abandon the theme and start over. This can really work and I have found that a completely new approach will be the answer.</p>
<p>Once I get a clear melodic line, or even as close to clear as I can, I then add harmony.<br />
Adding harmony to an established melody can be easy or difficult, and the tune, melody or theme, may have to be modified so that the harmony I want will fit with my melody.</p>
<p><strong>Time: Do You Need a Lot of It?</strong><br />
I’m not sure if having an abundance of time to compose a theme is an advantage. The more time I have, the more I debate. Good music can be composed quickly and one doesn’t really need tons of time. Maybe it’s just being time efficient that makes the difference.</p>
<p>If I have time, I can easily spend a few days getting the theme clearly stated. If there isn’t time, it’s a quicker process and I can’t debate it too much.  I like less time because I can get to the same place, quickly.</p>
<p>Those are my steps I take when launching a new project.<br />
I would love to hear what other composers do in the first creative moments, hours, days when starting something new. Is there an instrument that you just have to use? How do you work out a theme? Do you have favorite composers and themes which inspire you?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[How to keep your creative well from running dry.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m going a little off-topic here, but bear with me&#8230;</p>
<p>If you are anything like I am, you have many different ways in which you create. I think it is safe to say that we are all musically creative. We write, arrange, sketch, play, edit, perform, design, distort, and produce audio for various formats and productions. In my own career, however, I also like to work on my website, which I take care of myself. I love to take certain segments of our podcasts and edit/tweak them as a temporary (and I let me stress the word <em>temporary</em>!) tangent from my current scoring assignment. Though I am in no way, shape, or form a graphic designer, I have a fairly evolved sense of design aesthetic, and I very much enjoyed creating my own logo for my company. I design and create my own demo materials, promotional literature, and to a more limited degree, I like opening up Photoshop and seeing what trouble I can get into with my photos and graphics. To me, each one of these things is another creative outlet, and all of them allow me to divert my creative attention, albeit momentarily, to things other than film scoring. After all, you need an ear break every once in awhile, right?</p>
<p>I once heard a speaker talk about our “<em>Creative Gas Tank</em>.” As he put it, our creative gas tank is the level of output we are able to handle as creative individuals. Just like an automobile, we have a creative reserve to draw from that is only so deep. Once that reserve is tapped, we must refill somehow in order to continue our creative flow. Like the car you drive, if your tank is empty, it is only a matter of miles/feet/inches before you break down on the side of the road.</p>
<p>Obviously, you need to “refuel” when necessary, and there are as many ways to do that as there are to empty the tank. I take a lot of walks around the neighborhood of my studio. Even a little bit of simple physical activity is enough to grease my creative wheels and get me back to creating on all cylinders. Time spent with my girlfriend, Susie, and our family is often my #1 choice for getting recharged. It is very easy for me to “forget” about work when I am with her, and yet when it’s time to get back to it, I never feel more refreshed and energized than I do when I’ve just spent time with her. Other times, working on a completely unrelated creative task (like the ones mentioned above) will replenish whatever creative capital I’ve spent.</p>
<p>For you, refueling might look a bit different. Like me, it could be time away from the project spent either with some other creative task or out with your family taking a break from all things creative. For others of you, it might be working on a piece of music that is wholly different from the current assignment, maybe a pop tune or an arrangement of your latest concert piece.</p>
<p>What things refill your creative tank? What actions can you specifically point to that have given you the freedom to then come back to your assignment armed with a fresh perspective and ready to jump back in where you left off?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[You need to be able to write no matter how you feel. A professional composer cannot rely on <i>inspiration</i>.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since we are discussing &#8220;Going Pro&#8221; this month I wanted to touch on something that I believe is critical to being a professional: you need to be able to write no matter how you feel. A professional does not wait for inspiration — if inspiration is not at the starting line when the gun fires, a professional starts running and lets inspiration catch up.</p>
<p>I remember a specific moment during my college years when I was paralyzed with fear. Fear that I would wake up the next morning without inspiration. Fear that the melodies bouncing around in my head would be silent. Fear that my creativity would run dry. That was a defining point for me because, in that moment, I decided to learn how to write no matter if I felt inspired or not. It can be scary to sit down in front of the empty computer screen, or sheet of paper, and feel nothing. Yet this is something a professional must be able to do. When working with deadlines you can’t afford to wait until inspiration strikes — you have to just buckle down and get it done (and if you feel inspired while writing that is a bonus).  ;)</p>
<p>I am happy to say that I no longer live in fear of “running out of music”. I know that I can sit down and write at any time, anywhere. How did I get there? I started writing every day. I set a goal that I was going to write one piece a day and it had to be at least 8 measures long. That was where I started. Now I write for several hours every day. It is like weight training. You need to work on your muscles so that you can lift more and more. Music energizes me. I have learned that even on days when I start writing feeling no inspiration whatsoever, I usually go to bed in the early wee hours with so much music dancing in my head I wish I never had to waste time sleeping again but could just keep on writing.</p>
<p>If you are used to waiting for inspiration every time you compose there is no way to say how long it will take to finish a project. When someone approaches you about scoring something you need to know how long it will take you to do what they are asking for. I can guess pretty accurately how many hours it will take me to write a score based on &#8220;minutes of music needed&#8221; + &#8220;genre&#8221;. With those factors in mind, I&#8217;ll know if have time to complete the work within the time that is available. If you can’t deliver a good product in the time frame given, you need to consider whether you should say &#8220;yes&#8221; and hire help, or if you should say &#8220;no&#8221;. (But that’s a topic for another time.)</p>
<p>Thomas Edison said, “Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration.” I believe that to be true. I am quite sure that if John Williams only wrote when feeling inspired, he would not be the composer he is today. So, don’t worry if you don’t feel inspired. Start running and let inspiration catch up with you.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s get practical. There are several ways that I get started writing on days when I feel no inspiration. Often I get started by improvising. Most of the time I record it to capture any ideas worth refining later. I also have a collection of favorite pieces that I like to listen to; good music inspires me to write. Sometimes I start writing based on music theory knowing that certain chord progressions and instrument doublings will create a certain sound.</p>
<p>I would love to hear from you about this. What are some of your favorite ways to get started writing on days when inspiration is on holiday?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few years I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to work with many talented filmmakers from across the country and around the world. Like in so many other fields, today&#8217;s technology has made it possible to score a project with just about anyone no matter where they&#8217;re located. Although I&#8217;m grateful that all I need is a cell phone and an internet connection to collaborate with such a diverse group of filmmakers, long distance scoring does come with plenty of challenges.</p>
<div><a name="more"></a></div>
<div><strong>Demoing</strong></div>
<div>One of the most frightening aspects of long distance scoring is that once you send off a demo, it&#8217;s out of your hands. You relinquish all control over what type of system they are listening on, how loud they are listening, whether or not they&#8217;ve lined your cue up to the video in the right place, and so on. This is scary stuff, enough to make some composers not want to work with anyone they can&#8217;t demo for in the same room. It can be heartbreaking to have your cue thrown out, only to find out later that they thought it fought with the dialogue simply because they had it up too loud.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Although ultimately the client is going to listen to your music however they want to, there are some steps you can take to steer the situation towards a positive outcome.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Listen in Different Contexts</strong></div>
<div>Chances are you&#8217;ve invested some decent money into a good set of studio monitors, maybe even installed some acoustic treatment, and now when you play your cue back in your studio at 11 it sounds bitchin. You send off your epic masterpiece to the client and eagerly await praise and admiration. At last the phone rings and the client has notes for you, but rather than &#8220;powerful&#8221; and &#8220;awesome&#8221; they&#8217;re concerned your cue is &#8220;thin&#8221; and &#8220;weak&#8221;. What they heck is going on? Are they even listening to the same piece of music? And then the mystery is revealed when they say the dreaded phrase &#8220;Well, it was kind of hard to hear because I listened on my laptop&#8221;.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Besides throwing your phone through the wall, you can take some steps to keep this from happening. The first is to have a conversation at the beginning of the scoring process about what kind of speakers they&#8217;re going to be listening to your demos on. Explain to them why it&#8217;s so important that they listen on something better than laptop speakers, even if it takes a lot of convincing.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you&#8217;re still concerned that they&#8217;re listening on something like a laptop, you&#8217;re going to have to play by their rules. That means that after you mix and bounce, you find a laptop of your own to listen to the cue on. Imagine that this is exactly how your client is going to hear the cue. There&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ll need to make some adjustments after hearing it in this new context. Listening through a variety of sound sources is a good mixing idea, generally. Occasionally I&#8217;ll even burn a CD and go listen in my car for a whole new perspective on a mix.</div>
<div>Don&#8217;t allow your music to be destroyed by a bad listening environment. The most important thing you can do is make sure your client hears your music how it is intended to be heard.<strong> </strong></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Be Clear and Concise</strong></div>
<div>Because you won&#8217;t be in the room with them to discuss the process, it&#8217;s critical that you provide any information that could be necessary in your absence. This means that your filenames and notes leave no question about what the cue is, which version it is, where it should be lined up, etc. This might mean you need to include timecode numbers on the filename if they don&#8217;t know how to use timestamps.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you&#8217;re not able to talk to them directly and are simply sending the demo over e-mail it can also be a good idea to remind them what you&#8217;ve done with the scene. If it&#8217;s a first version perhaps explain your approach and why you wrote the way you did. If it&#8217;s a fix, remind them of what they asked for and explain how you accommodated the change. You don&#8217;t want to send them an essay analyzing the motives of the main characters, but a few lines about your line of thinking can be a helpful introduction to a cue.</div>
<div>Remember that you wont be in the room to defend your music, so you need to make your case right away.</div>
<div></div>
<div>To ensure a good mix between music and dialogue I&#8217;ve found it exceptionally useful to create my own Quicktimes and send those for demos rather than audio files. This way your intentions of how the music fits in the mix are perfectly clear and they can&#8217;t get it wrong.<strong> </strong></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Stay in Sync</strong></div>
<div>Depending on how long-distance the project is, another difficulty can be aligning your schedules. The main thing to keep in mind is that you work for them, not the other way around. They&#8217;re paying you, and because of this they&#8217;ll expect you to be responsive. Although you should expect your client to be reasonable, in general you need to be the one accommodating to their waking hours. This is a very important conversation to have at the beginning of the project. You don&#8217;t want to wake up one day to find your inbox full of angry and annoyed e-mails because you weren&#8217;t responding to their notes at 4:30am. Establish early on what kind of availability your client expect from you.</div>
<div>&#8211;</div>
<div>All of these tips are just as useful for local gigs, but they are crucial for success when working with someone on the other side of the world. The key to a successful long distance collaboration is frequent and open communication.</div>

		<description><![CDATA[Last week's <a href="../../../2010/03/weekend-provocation-getting-in.html">discussion</a> of spotting was all about entering a scene; now let's take some time to consider how to exit (gracefully… or maybe not so gracefully!). More on "getting out," after the jump.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently talked about <a href="../../../2010/03/weekend-provocation-getting-in.html">entering a scene</a> when you are spotting a film; now let&#8217;s take some time to consider how to exit (gracefully… or maybe not so gracefully!). More on &#8220;getting out,&#8221; after the jump.</p>
<p>At first glance, getting out seems to be easier than getting in. When the scene ends, simply stop the music along with it. Usually you&#8217;ll be using a chord with a fermata, so that you can fade smoothly into the next scene.</p>
<p>Of course, when we dig deeper we can see it&#8217;s more nuanced than that. No surprise there. But it&#8217;s more than mere complexity: the issue of getting out intertwines the &#8220;how&#8221; and the &#8220;when&#8221; on an even more basic level than we observed in our last peek into spotting.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s only natural, of course, because now we&#8217;re considering a situation where the music is, by definition, already playing. So my approach to the subject this week has to be a little more contextual and anecdotal than last time out, when we were starting (literally and sonically) from zero.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at some specific cases:</p>
<p><strong>Melodramatic &#8220;outs.&#8221;</strong> If you build, build, build a cue, then simply stop, the result is rather like being thrown off a musical cliff. Leading, say, a crucial line of dialog in this way is painting with a Big Brush (and yes, I&#8217;m aware of the horrendous mixed metaphor). It&#8217;s a strong, overt move that brings with it a greater risk of music drawing attention to itself. These kind of cue endings are referred to as &#8220;hard outs.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a result, it&#8217;s often <em>too</em> overt an approach, causing the performances to feel hammy or over-acted. Compositional choices <em>during</em> the cue play into this as well, of course, but simply choosing to end the cue in this way, in and of itself, can destroy a carefully-paced and constructed scene.<br />
One flavor of melodramatic out, in particular, deserves its own discussion. So let&#8217;s pause for…</p>
<p><strong>A Moment of Silence (before the building explodes).</strong> Here the same technique comes across as less of a mismatch, because the action the &#8220;out&#8221; accompanies is truly consequential. It need not be an exploding building… it might be as simple as a character deciding whether or not to flip a light switch. But that better be one important light switch! The narrative stakes must be high enough, in short, to warrant the choice. The intrusiveness of the move requires the viewer to be fully invested in the dramatic moment. Anything less, and the music will seem too manipulative.</p>
<p>Note, too, that in this case you&#8217;re <em>anticipating</em> the consequential action by using a negative accent (i.e., that moment of silence). You&#8217;re doing the same thing that veteran schoolteachers do when they really want the attention of the class. They don&#8217;t shout; they <em>whisper</em>.</p>
<p>One last thing here, and it&#8217;s just my opinion (but I think I&#8217;m right!): Using this technique is something you can do once or <em>maybe</em> twice during a project without exceeding the boundaries of good taste. Too much trickery and your score will be the musical equivalent of a pimpmobile.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe you think all that chrome looks <em>good</em>. To me it threatens to undercut the underlying intent. And it destroys the rhythm of what might otherwise be a very well thought-out, (musically) attractive design.</p>
<p>Once again, we&#8217;re talking about context. Pick your moments. Don&#8217;t be afraid of bold choices or gestures, but remember that most of your cues aren&#8217;t going to require something quite so gimmicky to function well.<br />
<strong><br />
</strong><br />
<strong>Don&#8217;t Give Away the Game.</strong> This one is the converse of the Moment of Silence: here you&#8217;re taking care not to exit the scene too early, because doing so would anticipate a payoff moment inappropriately. If a plot twist is coming up, for example, you want to do <em>nothing</em> to give away the game. If you&#8217;re in, stay in. If you&#8217;re out, stay out. The filmmakers have agonized over how to make this moment startling—and now they&#8217;re going to give you the power to ruin all that work with a clunker of a cue.</p>
<p><strong>The Reel Change and the Act-Out.</strong> These are moments in the project where you have no choice: you must be out. In the case of a television act-out, you&#8217;re going to commercial, so there&#8217;s literally no program to score. With a reel change, it&#8217;s not as cut-and-dried—it&#8217;s only a technical, physical requirement that constricts you from continuing your cue. You can skirt the issue by pausing, then resuming the music nearly imperceptibly—or, if it&#8217;s mission-critical that the music continue, the reel can be &#8220;rebalanced&#8221; to accommodate your cue.</p>
<p>Either way, though, we&#8217;re generally talking about an <em>inevitable</em> out-point. Even if you&#8217;re working on a film that will almost certainly see the light of day (or the darkened room) of theatrical distribution, you should observe the reel change. The changing means of digital distribution may soon make the reel change obsolete, but for the time being it&#8217;s a consideration that you (and/or your music editor) will have to contend with.</p>
<p><strong>The Contextual Out.</strong> I&#8217;m making up a term for this because I haven&#8217;t heard a better one (if you have, please let me know in the comments!). What I&#8217;m referring to here is coming out of a scene (or choosing not to spot a scene at all!) because of something that happens immediately afterwards. If you know a huge action scene is coming up, for example, you might choose to leave a significant amount of material unscored beforehand to avoid listener fatigue and/or heighten the auditory contrast.</p>
<p>This choice, of course, requires that you (ahem) know what&#8217;s coming up, and keep your decision-making  contextual. And, of course, it also applies to entering a scene—I should have mentioned it last week as well. After a huge, thunderous scene, you&#8217;ll want to be careful about coming right back in.</p>
<p><strong>Know When (and How Long) to Hold &#8216;Em.</strong> If you&#8217;re using a sustained chord or note to end your cue, keep in mind that you&#8217;ll want to hold it quite a bit longer than you think. It&#8217;s always better to have more of that last chord/note, rather than less. Music editors will thank you… actually, no, they probably won&#8217;t. You&#8217;re just expected to get this right. But they <em>will</em> be straight-up irate (and with good reason!) if you don&#8217;t give them a long enough &#8220;tail&#8221; at the end of a cue.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re working with live players, be aware that they&#8217;re generally able to hold that final note longer than you&#8217;d think. They&#8217;re smart enough to see that fermata coming, and to take appropriate action beforehand (for wind players, this is more of an issue, of course).</p>
<p>This was probably the most glaring of the many rookie blunders I made my first time conducting the <em>Family Guy</em> orchestra at the Newman Stage at Fox (for composer Ron Jones). I was pretty excited and nervous, and somehow the thought got in my head that the final chord of the cue might &#8216;fall apart&#8217; as the wind players ran out of breath. So I cut off the band waaay too early.</p>
<p>Big mistake. I had to be corrected from the booth… twice. Two blown takes; something like three minutes of wasted session time, total. Let me tell you, on the ten-minute break at the end of <em>that</em> session hour, pretty much everyone in the building was giving me the stink-eye. And I deserved it. So take the opportunity to pick up this particular tip the easy way.</p>
<p>Last one for now—although I&#8217;ll be watching the comments this weekend to answer questions on anything I&#8217;ve omitted:</p>
<p><strong>The &#8220;Pause&#8221; vs. the &#8220;Separate Cue.&#8221;</strong> This is something that caught me off guard the first time I encountered it as a teacher of film scoring for UCLA. From time to time, a student would score a scene with a loooong pause in the middle. It occurred to me that I needed to explain that, while their decision to leave part of the scene un-scored was OK (or, at worst, something we could talk about), anything beyond a brief pause really would be treated as a separate cue in the Real World.</p>
<p>I just mention it here out of caution—I believe the issue arose in my classes as an artifact of the isolated nature of class scoring assignments (i.e., there&#8217;s no real &#8216;context&#8217; in which to consider the ins and outs), but it&#8217;s something you should be aware of nonetheless. If there&#8217;s anything like a substantial pause in what you&#8217;re hearing, you&#8217;re generally better off structuring it as two cues.</p>
<p>There are a lot more things to talk about here, and you can get additional perspectives from film composing texts like <em>On the Track</em>, <em>The Reel World</em>, Berklee&#8217;s <em>Complete Guide to Film Scoring</em> and others. All are highly recommended… in fact, I&#8217;d consider them obligatory reading for every composer.</p>
<p>So far we&#8217;ve covered the ins and outs of spotting; next week we&#8217;ll wrap up the series by looking at the stuff in between. Can&#8217;t wait to read your comments… and don&#8217;t forget to &#8220;like up&#8221; any SCOREcaster comments you think are cool!</p>

<p>The music you put and don’t put in a film will affect the pacing of the film, its architecture.  For you to do this well demands a solid understanding of story, screen writing, film’s unique visual language and the brains and experience to apply that knowledge to the unique film you are working on.</p>
<h4>Spotting</h4>
<p>The spotting session is where you discuss the film with the director and make the initial decisions about placement and function of music in the film.</p>
<p>But spotting should begin before that meeting. Do your homework, watch the film and come to the spotting session prepared.</p>
<p>Spotting also continues after the official spotting session, because new ideas will come to you as your musical material develops and you spend more time with the film (and edits keep coming.)</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“A wise man changes his mind, a fool never does.” ~ Spanish proverb</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Following are some thoughts about finding <em>form</em> during spotting.</p>
<h4>A Bird&#8217;s Eye View</h4>
<p>No scene exists in isolation; they are all affected by what comes before and what comes after. So to properly place music in a film you should first have a bird’s eye view of the entire story.</p>
<p>I suggest you do this on your own as part of your prep for the spotting session.</p>
<p>Some things to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the central idea of the film, the metaphor (define in as few words as possible)</li>
<li>What is the tone/mood of the film (again, just a few descriptive terms.)</li>
<li>Define the three acts, where the plot points are and what they do.</li>
<li>Durations of introduction and conclusion</li>
<li>How the character arc(s) fits in.</li>
<li>And anything else that is important for your particular film.</li>
<li>What is the genre?</li>
</ul>
<p>I like to graph out the form of the film. I jot down timings and descriptions as I watch the film, I then draw horizontal lines to clearly delineate the form; acts, scenes etc.</p>
<p>I think of it like a painter doing a sketch on his canvas to get the shapes right. If you go right to the details, these smaller parts will be all out of proportion. I am a visual guy and doing this really helps me.</p>
<p>This overview is a good first subject of discussion at the spotting session to make sure you and the director are on the same page.</p>
<h4>Swooping In</h4>
<p><strong></strong>With a view of the whole in place, you can now move in to the details: <em>the individual cues</em>.</p>
<p>Obviously, the most important thing is the story. The start and end of a cue should be chosen to support the story.  That being said, here are some visual devices that directors often use to highlight important story and structural elements in a film:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom in – Zoom out</li>
<li>Dolly shot – tracking shot</li>
<li>Crane shot</li>
<li>Close ups (especially close ups that then zoom out. Often used to start a new section.)</li>
<li>Wide shots – long shots (such as in establishing shots, often at the starts of a new section.)</li>
<li>Fade in, fade out, cross fades, wipes etc…</li>
</ul>
<p>Some story driving elements which may not be accompanied by a fancy camera move:</p>
<ul>
<li>Something in the acting</li>
<li>A line of dialogue</li>
<li>An action</li>
<li>A prop</li>
<li>A plot point</li>
</ul>
<p>And remember, always consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where you are <em>in</em> the film</li>
<li>What comes before and after musically and in the story</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let us see some of these things through some examples.</p>
<h4>Big Introductions</h4>
<p>The introduction sets the tone for the film and must usually be approached differently than music in other parts of the film.</p>
<p>Here is a great example, from “The Rocketeer” by James Horner. (Say what you will about Horner, he knows how to spot a film.)</p>
<p>In this very cinematic introduction, Horner helps to create that introductory feeling by playing his melody right through the cuts, the dialogue and the various actions. But he still expertly follows structural points such as wide shots, close ups and important actions. And he does it while making a cohesive musical statement.</p>
<p>As you watch this scene, here are some things to watch out for as you watch this scene.</p>
<ul>
<li>00:00 &#8211; Film opens with credits on black. Melody in piano. Notice how the melody fits perfectly within the duration of the credits.</li>
<li>00:36 &#8211; hangar doors open. Melody is taken over by the strings.</li>
<li>02:06 &#8211; cockpit comes down signaling the start of the flight. The melody starts again here. Everything makes musical sense and follows the on-screen action. They talk and start the plane, the melody plays right through all that.</li>
<li>02:36 &#8211; Static wide shot as the plane rolls through the screen. Change of mood, B section? The music is bustling and creates anticipation. This static wide shot differs from the other shots so far, making it stand out. A good choice for a change in the music.</li>
<li>03:16 &#8211; extreme close up of eyes as Cliff puts on his goggles. The extreme close up is structural, signaling the start of the takeoff. Music changes, getting more intense.</li>
<li>03:52 &#8211; take off! This important action doesn’t need any special camera angle! The music soars. But through the flight, the dialogue and the acrobatics, the melody just plays right through.</li>
<li>04:37 &#8211; plane flying towards frame left. The music cadences just before and stops before the next cut.</li>
<li>04:42 &#8211; cut: guy shooting a Tommy gun at towards audience and moving away from camera. This is a textbook structural shot that signals the start of a new section. Horner stops the music there, but what is most important is that the music doesn’t resume once we see the plane again. This would have negated the feeling of introduction he created in the first 6 minutes, which that musical form in film is just as much about where you put music as where you don’t.</li>
</ul>
<p><object width="640" height="385" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/mNZCK5jw69Y&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="640" height="385" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/mNZCK5jw69Y&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p>Good spotting is as much about where you put your music as where you don’t!</p>
<h4>Small Introductions</h4>
<p><strong></strong>Individual scenes can also have introductions and conclusions. Not all scenes have sections of course; some are shorter, transitory scenes, but longer set-pieces often do.</p>
<p>As an example, I have chosen the Boat Chase from “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade” by John Williams. This is a great example of an introduction within a scene.</p>
<ul>
<li>36:32 -Indy and Elsa come out of the sewer. There is no music. There was tons of music in the previous scene(s) so it’s good to have a break here, and it makes room for the humor.</li>
<li>36:48 – “Ah Venice” and Kazim comes out. Music starts here, being only an introduction which leads to the melody that starts when we…</li>
<li>37:19 &#8211; Cut to boat with guy hanging behind. This is the start of the boat chase proper and the melody begins here! All the running before was leading to this, so it made sense for the music to lead up to the melody!</li>
</ul>
<p><em> (EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE: Unfortunately, this clip is not available at YouTube.com, so you&#8217;ll have to pop in the DVD.)</em></p>
<p>JW is a master at structuring scenes using logical musical form. So it is always a good idea to listen to the music of the masters in the context of the film.<strong> </strong></p>
<h4>What&#8217;s It About?</h4>
<p><strong></strong>More important than the cut and fancy camera angles is knowing what the scene is about, and sometimes that means playing the music over cuts that seem like a start or an ending. A great example is the meeting of Daryl Van Horne in “The Witches of Eastwick.”</p>
<p>The scene starts where everyone is trying to remember Van Horne’s name but no one can. But most importantly, this scene is about Van Horne’s first contact with these ladies. Always know what your scene is about.</p>
<ul>
<li>22:00 &#8211; close up of card and roses, and pull back. Music in.</li>
<li>22:24 &#8211; low angle shot as pearls fall and everyone starts to remember his name. Music follows.</li>
<li>22:38 &#8211; crazy lady breaks her leg. Music follows.</li>
<li>23:06 &#8211; establishing shot of exterior of Cher’s house, a cross fade AND a close up! Now this would look like a place to have the music out with all these visual signals of form, but Cher is still thinking about Daryl Van Horne and, do you remember what is going on in this part of the story? So JW plays through and leads straight to…</li>
<li>23:54 &#8211; “Looking for me?” This is the first contact with Van Horne and the music comes out here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that is smart spotting, which totally helps the form, flow and the direction of the story.</p>
<p>The bottom line is spotting is about knowing what the important structural elements are, then using that to guide the form of your music, both on the cue level and on the level of the entire film.</p>
<p>There is of course a lot more we could discuss about structure and spotting. Zemickis and Silvestri are also brilliant at this. I suggest you look at “Back to the Future’ and how the music changes at an important plot point at the end of the first act. Or the way “Cast Away” was spotted.</p>
<h4>Comments</h4>
<p><strong></strong>&#8230; are open below. Can you point to any other examples of great spotting? Let&#8217;s hear them!</p>

And I mean that in the literal, original sense of the word. When I walk into my studio—especially now that I&#8217;ve done some gigs and accumulated some sample libraries—I have a feeling akin to reverence. Not in an egomaniacal way (<em>the High Holy Temple of Film Music! Look upon my works, ye mighty, and despair!</em>), but just in terms of the incredible creative resource that room has become in my life.</div>
<p>There&#8217;s something I think you should keep in mind, though, when you get to a similar point in your career: <strong>Your gear will not save you.</strong><br />
<strong></strong><br />
<a name="more"></a><strong></strong><br />
It won&#8217;t save you from a lack of planning.<br />
It won&#8217;t save you from the unexpected.<br />
It won&#8217;t save you from a bad collaboration.<br />
It won&#8217;t save you from poor eating and sleeping habits.<br />
It won&#8217;t save you from the mess you may be making of your relationships.</p>
<p>In fact, in a different sense, your gear won&#8217;t &#8220;save you&#8221; a penny. It will cost you, and keep costing you, as long as you continue in this business. In strict financial terms, that studio of yours is a <em>liability.</em></p>
<p>Quite a few dark and stormy thoughts for this time of year… but there is a bright side. It&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to leave you with over the holiday season, and it&#8217;s one that I&#8217;ve been hitting hard, in one way or another, over the past month:<br />
It&#8217;s what your gear allows you to do that is important.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the ability to say &#8220;yes&#8221; to gigs that might otherwise be impossible that makes your gear a tangible asset.<br />
It&#8217;s the unprecedented sonic variety and fidelity available to everyone reading this that makes the technology more than simply a cheap replacement for live human beings in a recording studio.</p>
<p>Yeah—it&#8217;s not the gear, it&#8217;s what you do with it. With maximum emphasis on the &#8220;you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether you see your studio equipment and software as a <em>luxury</em> or a <em>necessity</em> for your creative process, there&#8217;s no arguing that gear has disrupted our identity as composers. It&#8217;s fundamentally changed how we go about organizing sound, and even how we go about marketing that ability (and our opinions as to how it should be done!). Even if gear isn&#8217;t the entire future of composing, it&#8217;s a fundamental driver of all the fastest-changing parts of it. It&#8217;s essential to each of us in one way or another. It won&#8217;t save us, but it can inspire us, challenge us, surprise us… and every once in a while, it can even fill us with awe.</p>
<p>I hope everyone is closing out the year in high style! Weekend Provocation will return on New Year&#8217;s Day with something special. Thank you for reading, and for energizing this community we&#8217;re building with your comments and feedback. You people are deeply cool, and I can&#8217;t wait to see where the conversation takes us in 2010.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>Regardless of what Santa leaves beneath your technological tree this season, you&#8217;ll eventually find yourself facing that blank canvas… once again, just like always. While a new array of sounds may inspire you to work just a little differently or try something just a little bit new, keep in mind:<strong> The gear is just a tool.</strong><br />
<strong><a name="more"></a></strong></p>
<div>Here I&#8217;m building on the contents of a couple of recent Weekend Provocations, where I&#8217;ve wondered out loud about what it would be like to write music <em>without</em> the gear. If you noticed that these two articles (<a href="../../../2009/11/weekend-provocation-what-could-you-do.html">November 13</a> and <a href="../../../2009/12/weekend-provocation-gear-free-edition.html">December 11</a>) were essentially the same, with slightly different premises, you get a big gold star.</div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<div>Truly getting the most out of your gear involves more than just purchasing Shiny New Things. And, as Richard Bellis put it so aptly in last month&#8217;s <a href="../../../2009/11/emmy-award-winning-composer-richard.html">column</a>, putting your mind between the project and your computer means that the idea comes first.</p>
<p>After you unwrap and install and authorize (!) your new gear, there&#8217;s a breaking-in period. Depending on the depth of the new sample library or virtual instrument, it&#8217;ll take anywhere from several hours to several months for those new sounds to sink into your brain. For them to <em>occur</em> to you naturally.</p>
</div>
<div>But that&#8217;s the goal: for the new capabilities of your rig to become part of your creative process without too much conscious thought. Just another color of your palette, understood as deeply as you understand the capabilities of, say, an oboe. Or a violin, or a snare drum, or a compressor, or a reverb, or… you get the idea.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re like me, at first your efforts to include your (expensive, RAM-intensive) new toys will likely be contrived… musical excuses to deploy your new arsenal in the most obvious ways. Over time, though, these new goodies will worm their way into your consciousness and your thought process. It will become a natural inclination to reach for them, just the same as you reach for your preferred sonorities or your favorite harmonic moves. And you&#8217;ll begin to imagine new and novel ways to incorporate them—and <em>that</em> is when, IMHO, they really start to be worth what you paid for them.</p>
<p>It brings to mind a fairly deep conceptual question, actually: how much of our personal style is merely repetition? How much can we change our sound from project to project without losing our musical identity or integrity? These are valid issues to think about… but perhaps not too much. Not to the detriment of actually doing the thing. Too much introspection can lead to paralysis.</p>
<p>What is imperative, though, is that we take time to &#8220;sound out&#8221; the resources in our studio. Explore the capabilities… groove those elements that work (to our own ears, anyway!) into our brains, so that when we need them we&#8217;ll remember they&#8217;re there. The appropriate neural pathways will already have been created.</p>
<p>Before I go on with the main thrust of my column, I have to include something Ron Jones mentioned to my USC class years ago. It&#8217;s something that has stuck with me, and something I always try to remember when I&#8217;m working with new gear: <em>Just because the factory says it&#8217;s a [insert patch name here], doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s so.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard sounds that are horrendous approximations of what they claim to be replicating… but that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re not useful. Getting my mind into the state where I can use sounds (old and new) for what they are, sonically, means that I have to be listening without even the simplest of pre-judgements. Forgetting what the manufacturer tells me I&#8217;m hearing!</p>
<p>Listen to your sounds. What do they suggest to you? Try &#8216;em out in every deployment you can think of. Do what Ron had us do as students: create a test sequence that you run every patch through. This thing might be 100 bars or more, including every articulation, tempo, dynamic level, etc. you can think to include. Use the whole keyboard—even in ranges where the sound &#8220;shouldn&#8217;t work.&#8221; You never know what you&#8217;ll find. Use your own ear and taste as your guide—find those aforementioned discoveries that will set you apart. Be as systematic about the procedure as you can. It&#8217;s time well spent if you find even <em>one</em> rock-solid way of using your gear that is new and unique to you.</p>
<p>This whole process—which I often refer to as &#8220;tone patrol&#8221;—is time- and energy-intensive. It taxes our creative faculties. It requires active imagination and constant attention. It&#8217;s <em>tiring</em>. I can only focus on this for an hour or two at a time before reaching burnout. But it&#8217;s the best way, maybe the only way, for you to really maximize your gear. And it&#8217;s the best way to get those new sounds into your head, too.</p>
<p>Something I say all the time to students is this: <strong>we can only write what occurs to us to write.</strong> Having new gear reminds me of this. When we expand our gear collection, it takes a while for the whole slew of new possibilities to occur to us organically and naturally. Our first efforts at integration are likely to be obvious… contrived… immature. My advice is to work through that. Get those first fledgling efforts out of the way. Struggle (always underrated, struggle!) with finding the best way, the <em>right</em> way for you to use your new gear to express and expand the same invaluable musical personality that continues to define you.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you&#8217;ll be making the same noise as everyone else. Which is, how you say, not so good. After all, we all have access to the same tools. We always have. It&#8217;s how we use those tools that makes us special. As always.</p>
<p>The gear is just a tool. But a more powerful, more dangerous, more playing-field-leveling tool than ever before.</p>
<p>So when you go rummaging beneath the tree to see what Santa&#8217;s left you this holiday season… open with caution.</p>

<div>Besides the obvious question (if a cue is musically viable—i.e., complete—without the ORCH or the MELODY, why have it there in the first place?), and the &#8220;too many toppings on the pizza&#8221; tendency this style of writing brings with it, there is, for me, at least one positive aspect to writing library cues:<strong> They force us to work the details.</strong><br />
<a name="more"></a>When we&#8217;re writing along, fast and loose, like we all love to do—when the ideas are really pouring out of our brains onto the computer screen—there&#8217;s a tendency to hear our work the way we <em>want</em> to hear it. Especially when the cue is strongly melodic. We sing along in our brain instead of listening to all the little components of the supporting elements to make sure they&#8217;re solid.</div>
<div>When it comes time to make our various mixouts, it&#8217;s sometimes a rude awakening to discover that that bass part we slapped in (no pun intended) is pretty horrendously out of the pocket. Or the snare that was &#8220;good enough&#8221; on beats 2 and 4 now pretty much <em>ruins</em> the PRC ONLY mix.</div>
<div>The point here is simple, really: <em>attention to detail</em>.</div>
<div>The easy availability of amazing individual sounds makes it more important than ever to pay attention to each element. Here&#8217;s why: When we put a minty-fresh Omnisphere lead (or a wonderfully live-sounding Acid loop, or whatever) on top of a sloppily-constructed foundation, it is, in fact, often good enough to make us happy. The lead line really can carry the weight… make up for all manner of shortcomings elsewhere… get one more cue onto the &#8220;done&#8221; pile.</div>
<div>If we&#8217;re willing to settle for mediocre work. If we fall into the trap of tricking not just our clients, but also ourselves, with the latest Shiny Thing.</div>
<div>So, along with all the wonderful techno-toys we&#8217;re lucky to have at our disposal these days, a word of warning: before you move to what&#8217;s next on your composing docket, be sure to attend to each of the moving parts of the machine you&#8217;re building <em>now</em>. The whole can be greater than the sum of the parts (maybe I should write that: the FULL mix really can be greater than the sum of the mixouts?), but only if you&#8217;re still sweating the details of every single element.</div>

<p>And no matter how much you stare at that blank sequencer page, the notes just aren&#8217;t forthcoming? And you wonder if you&#8217;ll ever get that li&#8217;l spark of inspiration back..</p>
<p>How do you get your compositional, creative, musical mojo back if it&#8217;s gone on hiatus and you&#8217;re suffering a little <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8216;Creative Burnout&#8217;?</span></p>
<p>First: recognise that though you are sadly mojo-less now but that it shall inevitably return again! We&#8217;ve all experienced it from time to time, it&#8217;s perfectly normal, and there really is light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>Make time to recharge the juices in your creative batteries and then get back in the game. :-)</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>So… I was brainstorming ideas for this here topic of creativity and creative processes (of course, Creativity 101 is brainstorming, how else would I start)… and my research led me to this post:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/essays/33-how-to-survive-creative-burnout/" target="_blank">How to survive creative burnout by Scott Berkun</a></p>
<p>I cannot tell you how this post resonated with me, an utterly positive experience &#8211; a relief.</p>
<h3>Wake Up Call</h3>
<p>I read recently in one of Deane&#8217;s comments</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Unless your heart is miserable when you are not making music, unless you feel sick to your stomach when you are not composing the music you hear in your everyday life meanderings, please, I beg you&#8230; go do something else.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-style: italic; text-align: right;">Comment in <a href="../../../2009/11/weekend-provocation-gets-uncomfortable.html">Weekend Provocation Gets Uncomfortable</a></span></p>
<p>I cannot tell you how that depressed me.</p>
<p>Because, at that time, I could think of nothing less I&#8217;d rather do than sit at the computer and write music.</p>
<p>Yes. Alarm bells, people. This was not a nice place to be in. Should I go do something else? If the thought of composing was turning me into a grumpy wretch, perhaps now was the time to reevaluate certain life choices.</p>
<p>I have been composing for as long as I can remember. Even before all the formal training stuff, I&#8217;ve been writing little ditties and improvising on various instruments. It&#8217;s just something that I like to do. There&#8217;s always a tune evolving in my head. There&#8217;s no off switch for that particular radio (bit pschizo I know, but maybe that&#8217;s what it takes to be creative, eh?).</p>
<p>Though I don&#8217;t get the pangs that Deane clearly feels if I&#8217;m not composing, I get really ratty if I&#8217;m not allowed to write, for whatever reason, for several days in a row. Totally antsy, mean and not very nice to be around. I&#8217;m never happier or more energised than when I&#8217;m in the flow and composing in the studio.</p>
<p>It was a gradual feeling that slithered up without me even realising it, but recently I wasn&#8217;t getting that kick out of the process. And that&#8217;s why we do it isn&#8217;t it? Put ourselves through the heartwrenching lows and orgasmic highs to scribe our feelings into music? Because we love it, masochistic types that we are ;-)</p>
<p>So there was no kick. No nothing.</p>
<p>But now I&#8217;m back in the game. Wooh yeah! It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m 22 again and the music&#8217;s just flowing.</p>
<p>So what was this weird blip I experienced? Creative burnout. Sounds a bit yuppy psychobabble but it fits the bill&#8230;</p>
<h3>Toasty</h3>
<p>Reading through Scott Berkun&#8217;s post, I realised that what I was experienced was completely normal, other people go through it, and, more importantly, it&#8217;s not permanent. I wish I&#8217;d found the post a month or so ago, and perhaps the recovery process would have been more expedient, and certainly less worrisome.</p>
<p>But as it is, I found a way through it, and if this post helps just one of you lovely SCORECast readers avoid the burnout, or (if it&#8217;s inevitable in your line of work, as I suspect it may be in mine) recover from it faster, perhaps it will have a had a greater purpose.</p>
<p>Cos it really did suck big time.</p>
<p>From Scott&#8217;s article, here are some of the common signs of burnout:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You dread getting up in the morning (unless this is not unusual for you)</li>
<li>You don’t care anymore about something you were passionate about</li>
<li>You saw the title of this essay and felt a ray of hope</li>
<li>Inspired motivated creative people annoy you</li>
<li>Everything seems gray and pointless</li>
<li>You’re drinking more or eating more, or showing whatever your signs of depression are</li>
<li>You find it hard to relax</li>
<li>It seems impossible to do basic work you know you’re capable of</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Any of this sound familiar? :-S</p>
<p>I had gotten to the end of a long series of very cool, but exacting, scheduled projects and had returned home with the idea that now I could work on my own ideas, write something just for me &#8211; that perhaps that was the problem, and I just needed to spend a little time composing purely for the sake of it.</p>
<p>My muse clearly had other plans though. She&#8217;d up and left and headed out the country, it seems. Sick of the never-ending requests for inspiration, she was wrung dry, and not best pleased about it.</p>
<p>So I decided not to fight it.</p>
<p>This has to be Step 1 in the recovery strategy for Creative Burnout &#8211; <em>Acceptance</em>.</p>
<p>Realise that the only way around is through it. Be ok with it. And go and do something else.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s Step 2 &#8211; <em>do something else</em>. Don&#8217;t just wallow in self-loathing and disgust cos the tunes aren&#8217;t materialising. Do something fun, different, exciting, relaxing. Despite my independent feminist right-on perspectives, I ended up baking cookies, brownies, cakes etc. Yummy, sweet, warming things that maybe weren&#8217;t so great for the waistline in the long term, but in the short term it was something fun, very different (food prep is my better-half&#8217;s arena), easy but a little creative, with something physical and real to show for it at the end.</p>
<p>Maybe that was Step 3 &#8211; <em>do something creative but in a different field</em>.</p>
<p>Then there was all the other practical stuff that would have probably sorted me out eventually had I not done any of the above &#8211; I got enough sleep, ate really well (apart from all the cookies), got back into yoga and  met up with friends that I didn&#8217;t have the chance to previously because of long hours at work and generally being v tired, not exactly life and soul of the party.</p>
<p>So now it&#8217;s all good. I&#8217;m back on track, and utterly relieved.</p>
<p>Maybe it is an inevitable part of the Film Composer&#8217;s life that Creative Burnout looms purely from a result of plumbing the depths of our emotions and processing them with the full extent of our skills, on demand, on a regular basis and to tight schedules.</p>
<p>Having gone through it I know that if ever happens again, rather than mistaking it for a sign that I should quit the business, I will now recognise it for the temporary, fixable event that it is.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just a little reminder to take a step back and recharge the batteries ready for the next epic score. ;-)</p>

<p><em>Over to you&#8230;</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Have you ever experienced any of the symptoms of creative burnout?<br />
What strategies got you through to the other side?<br />
What do you do differently in future to avoid it?</strong></p>
<p>All anecdotes and advice strongly appreciated!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also interested to see how many of us will admit to it. We&#8217;re supposed to be constantly up, ready to give the project our all, to keep writing into the fourteenth hour and have those creative juices ready and raring to go the next day without fail &#8211; is it professional suicide to admit defeat? To realise that you gotta recharge those inspiration batteries once in a while?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so… at least… I hope not… ;-)</p>

<div><strong>Write a one-minute cue, with at least two rounds of feedback from someone else whose opinion you value</strong>—could be a loved one, could be the family pet. It&#8217;s up to you. No additional constraints, except the ones you choose to put on yourself. But you really have to find someone who will be honest with you about what does and doesn&#8217;t work for them.</div>
<div>My point in suggesting this exercise is to explore what resonates with the people around you, and to see if that stuff is the same stuff, related stuff, or <em>completely different</em> stuff than what resonates with you. Equally important, it&#8217;s about gaining some free experience in trying to translate someone else&#8217;s feedback into meaningful, successful revisions.</div>
<div>Interpreting someone&#8217;s comments—figuring out what they&#8217;re trying to tell us in this incredibly subjective, incredibly difficult-to-quantify realm, is a crucial skill for us all to develop.</div>
<div>It&#8217;s always fascinating (at least to me) when I knock out a cue, just relying on the craft to get the stupid thing done, and then that cue becomes a big hit with The Powers That Be. You do this thing long enough, and it&#8217;s gonna happen. You&#8217;ll turn in some work that you feel is sort of uninspired and routine, and magic happens. The client <em>loves</em> it. It becomes the blueprint for the rest of the project… and you&#8217;re stuck with this thing that, to you, is nothing special.</div>
<div>Or maybe the converse happens: you really dig a particular cue—you&#8217;d bet the farm that this one&#8217;s gonna be a Big Winner. And then… nothing. Or worse, the client feels you&#8217;re not even in the ballpark of what they were expecting. How to make the requisite changes? How to get inside the heads of the people who are hiring you and come up with a winner?</div>
<div>Let&#8217;s do a little field work this weekend. Let&#8217;s calibrate our personal cool-o-meters and polish up our skills as translators.</div>
<div>Write something you think is right in your personal wheelhouse—in the sweet spot of your <a href="../../../2009/09/weekend-provocation-locus-of-cool.html">locus of cool</a>; something you know for a fact that you do well—and see how it works for someone whose opinion you value. Maybe it&#8217;ll be the roaring success you expect it to be. Maybe, if you really press for (and correctly interpret) an honest evaluation, you&#8217;ll find unexpected areas in which you can improve and grow. At the very least, it&#8217;s a good excuse to write a kick-ass demo cue in a style that&#8217;s near and dear to your heart. And that&#8217;s never a bad thing.</div>
<div>BTW, if you&#8217;d like your fellow SCOREcasters to offer up their opinions, just include a link and let us know. We&#8217;ll be happy to give you the unvarnished truth. Which might require a little less translating than what you&#8217;ll get from your goldfish. :-)</div>
<div>Can&#8217;t wait to hear what you come up with. I&#8217;ll do one of these as well. I&#8217;ll run it by a few pairs of trusted ears and let you know the good, the bad and the ugly. Thinking about it now, I&#8217;m a little nervous to get started. And I think that&#8217;s a good thing.</div>
<div>Happy writing!</div>

<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hCspY__CLOo/Srw9l6r8xJI/AAAAAAAAAGU/ggYKECs1swE/s1600-h/dc-101.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5385246976046318738" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 213px; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; width: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hCspY__CLOo/Srw9l6r8xJI/AAAAAAAAAGU/ggYKECs1swE/s320/dc-101.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></p>
<div>Each of us serves as curator of our own locus of cool. It is the starting point for each of our own musical journeys. Something about a chord progression, or a voicing, or a texture, captures our ear. Into the locus of cool it goes… on display for our contemplation, alongside everything else we&#8217;ve chosen to put there. The importance of selecting each item carefully and cataloguing it faithfully is of supreme importance, as should be obvious. (That&#8217;s the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in the photo… someday I hope my own musical &#8220;collection&#8221; rivals theirs!)</p>
<p>I often tell people that composers can only write what occurs to us to write… and a big part of that &#8220;occurring&#8221; comes from this place. Imagine if Bartók had not traveled to the countryside with Kodály to collect folk songs… or if Debussy had skipped the 1889 Paris<em> Exposition Universelle</em> and missed hearing the Javanese gamelan music. A primary exhibit in their museum—missing. A completely different locus of cool, resulting in a different (and, one suspects, lesser) body of work from each.</p>
<p>We collect ideas from everywhere we can, and then they interact. The museum metaphor falls away, and the &#8220;melting pot&#8221; metaphor begins. New ideas bubble up to the surface, irrevocably changed by the fire of our artistic inspiration… but that&#8217;s a subject for another Provocation, on another Weekend.</p>
<p>For now: <strong>What does your locus of cool sound like?</strong> Is it formed by composers like Mahler, Stravinsky, Debussy? Or is it better defined as one part raga, two parts oom-pah band? Or something else entirely?</p>
<p>What exhibits would we find if we wandered through the space you&#8217;ve curated? What are you doing to expand your collection? I hope every room is already full of wonders and curiosities, and that there&#8217;s always a hall or two set aside for new discoveries.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/08/sig-satterwhite.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-734" title="sig-satterwhite" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/08/sig-satterwhite.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>Over the past several years, a new word has entered the film music lexicon threatening the functional traditions the craft of scoring was built upon. This indiscriminate battle cry was practically nonexistent during the first hundred years of film music. Today, it&#8217;s a word carrying a vulgar weight amongst filmmakers and audiences alike.</p>
<p>This is the new evil feared amongst the collective patrons of the film industry, the scarlet letter nobody wants to see branded, and the dreaded angel-of-death for all <a class="zem_slink" title="Film score" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score">film scores</a> of worth. At the mere hint of it, filmmakers raise their crossed-fingered hands as if warding off the demon seed of Satan himself.</p>
<p>It has left me flummoxed, perplexed, and downright nonplussed.</p>
<p>What is this new &#8220;four-letter-word?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">manipulative</span></span>.</p>
<p>A quick Google search yields the following quotes&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;They don&#8217;t need manipulative music to express their emotions.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;He&#8217;s said that older film music is manipulative, like a commercial, with the music telling you how to feel, like propaganda&#8230;&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;The movie is shamelessly manipulative from start to finish&#8230;&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Balderdash!</p>
<p>Not only is <span style="font-style: italic;">manipulation</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">manipulative music</span> something that should not be feared, on the contrary, it should be embraced! Why?</p>
<p>For starters, it is the very essence surrounding the function of film music. Telling a story through the use of moving images is an awkward and obstacle-ridden medium. The great challenge which lies in expressing a narrative through film is that the storytellers can not be content with mere observation of their work. As an audience you can&#8217;t simply sit in a theater and observe a film. That&#8217;s not good enough. That&#8217;s not why we love movies. It&#8217;s not enough to merely observe the film, we have to experience it! We have to live it. We have to feel everything the characters are feeling even though it may be unrealistic for an audience to relate to them. We have to invest our emotional fortitude into their triumphs and equally empathize with their tribulations. This is essential and none of it achieved without careful and prescribed manipulation.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the very nature of cinema. To ask of your audience a degree of personal investment attained through artificial means. This is called manipulation.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re watching THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (1995), are you naturally going to relate to hardened criminals sentenced to a lifetime of captivity for their evil crimes? The average moviegoer will not have the faculties to come close to comprehending this experience. Yet, <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f80000000001e1b46" title="Thomas Newman" rel="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002353/">Thomas Newman</a>&#8216;s exquisite score manipulates and guides our emotional stream of unconsciousness in a way that would not be possible without it. When those convicts drink their beer on the &#8220;second-to-last day on the job&#8221; feeling like &#8220;lords of all creation,&#8221; we can relate on such an infinitely profound level of intimacy.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Newman for manipulating me.</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re watching <a class="zem_slink" title="E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" rel="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083866/">E.T. &#8211; THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL</a> (1982), are you naturally going to feel Elliot&#8217;s profound love for a gangly alien being to the point where your own heart breaks when he&#8217;s forced to tell him goodbye. This will not happen without <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f8000000000121aae" title="John Williams" rel="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002354/">John Williams</a>&#8216; vehemently powerful score commanding you to do so.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Williams for manipulating me.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_6sJwCvpA_rI/SntOsogDZ7I/AAAAAAAAACw/SgJYBBxHIyY/s1600-h/et.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5366969909635147698" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 266px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 400px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_6sJwCvpA_rI/SntOsogDZ7I/AAAAAAAAACw/SgJYBBxHIyY/s400/et.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>When you&#8217;re watching GLORY (1986), are you naturally going to feel the overwhelming sense of pride and honor each soldier of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry feels when they storm Fort Wagner? <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f800000000025f5be" title="James Horner" rel="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000035/">James Horner</a>&#8216;s devinely inspired score manipulates us into feeling such things whereas otherwise we&#8217;d be left abandoned to feel far more natural emotions in these situations like fear, anxiety, or sympathy.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Horner for manipulating me.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_6sJwCvpA_rI/SntPJ7xKjUI/AAAAAAAAAC4/7yhf8ZjSL-w/s1600-h/glory_l.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5366970413023399234" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 258px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 400px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_6sJwCvpA_rI/SntPJ7xKjUI/AAAAAAAAAC4/7yhf8ZjSL-w/s400/glory_l.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Granted music is not the only form of manipulation found in cinema. It is the sole job of every contributor to a film, be it costume designer, cinematographer, writer, director, effects artist, make-up artist, sound designer, etc. to craft their magic for the sole purpose of audience manipulation.</p>
<p>This is why I love movies so much. The good ones literally command me to dream, to feel, to aspire, and to inspire. Such unscrupulous control stems from effective music ranging from the explosively robust, to the subtlety fragile.</p>
<p>Opponents of this decree sometimes declare that it&#8217;s okay to be manipulated as long as you don&#8217;t know you&#8217;re being manipulated. Really? Then why go to movies? If you enjoy a movie, you&#8217;re being manipulated.</p>
<p>Perhaps when people use the term &#8220;manipulative&#8221; in a negative context they really mean &#8220;inappropriate?&#8221; Maybe. That makes far more sense. Inappropriate music or non-functional music can certainly destroy any intimacy built within the cinematic experience. This knowledge is nearly as old as film music itself. I don&#8217;t believe, however, that&#8217;s the intention behind the use of the word.</p>
<p>The truth is good scores are manipulative scores and good films are manipulative films. I wouldn&#8217;t want it any other way.</p>
<p>Manipulate me, please!</p>

<p>Funny thing is, up until a couple of months ago I had no idea most T.V. shows were scored in the box &#8211; that’s how long it’s been since I worked in TV. In my day everything was scored with an orchestra of about thirty players. I started in T.V. and we scored five shows a week, every week. I’m aware of what a composer can achieve from today’s synth studio, but I still feel badly for the thousands of sessions lost to the incredible <a href="http://www.afm.org/locals/info/number/47">Local 47</a> musicians. In this regard I don’t think technology is our friend. I asked a session player friend to comment on this and they were reluctant to do so. I understand the reasons.</p>
<p>Are today’s T.V. scores better then they were in my day? I don’t know the answer to that. I can tell you that the composers I worked with wrote to timing notes which detailed everything that happened in the particular picture sequences they were writing. This forced the composer to hit their ‘anchor points’ of dialogue and cuts. Funny how you don’t see much of that these days even though the composer has digital picture. The go-to book in my day was called “Scoring For Films” by the composer <a href="http://www.earlehagen.net/">Earle Hagen</a>.  If you’re studying composition it might be worth a look see. Another interesting film music book from &#8216;the old days&#8221; is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=7ozTus2HZbsC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Film+music++By+Roy+M.+Prendergast#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">Film Music by Roy Prendergast.</a> I included this link because it detailed the kind of work we did as music editors. That illustration is a bar breakdown chart, where you can see the timings of the action and the cuts above the written music.</p>
<p>Another concept worth noting are today’s main titles vs the classic main titles. Check it out. I would love to hear your feedback on what makes a great Main Title. I still love the themes I can remember. It always made the show a bit more fun and exciting to watch, but that&#8217;s my take. It just takes mentioning &#8220;The Love Boat&#8221;, &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" title="Gilligan's Island" rel="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057751/">Gilligan&#8217;s Island</a>&#8220;, or &#8220;Hill St. Blues&#8221; and you have that tune in your head. Am I right? For me, that&#8217;s the stuff great main titles contain. What are your favorites?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sig-fenoughty.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-669" title="sig-fenoughty" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sig-fenoughty.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>As a media composer, work is like buses. There&#8217;s nothing for a while, then three projects come along at once.</p>
<p>In the last six months I have been inundated with composing and sound design work for film and theatre and I am constantly thanking my lucky stars. This is exactly what I wanted when I started out many years ago.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<div style="float: right; margin: auto 0px 30px 30px;"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5360077328352690530" style="float: right; margin: 0pt 10px 30px 0pt;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R_A7kO7XEmo/SmLR7mUWQWI/AAAAAAAAACA/02xwteqKs4Y/s320/graphicscore.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">Stay sane in the midst of chaos!</div>
</div>
<p>Just kidding &#8211; of course it is, but on a day-to-day basis it can be a little bit of a challenge to keep the many, many minutes of music flowing, pouring out your heart and soul on demand, whilst maintaining a vague level of sanity.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really, truly and utterly important not to take on too much work. The amount that will make all of your creative efforts suffer and, inevitably, life miserable (plus you&#8217;ll likely get a rep and your success&#8217;ll be pretty short-lived).</p>
<p>But short of that, I&#8217;ve never turned composing work down that I honestly believe I have the time and the skills to work on. This strategy hasn&#8217;t failed me yet ;-)</p>
<h2>Variety</h2>
<p>The variety of having multiple composing projects on the go is fantastic, and I really do enjoy it. In a way, having several very different works in progress keeps the interest going and staves off staleness. If you do hit a brick wall and are seriously not in the right mindset for one project there&#8217;s always the option of switching around your schedule to work on another.</p>
<h2>Figure out how best you work&#8230;</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re built this way, you can always &#8216;flit&#8217; between tasks, as suggested as a way of working in <a href="../../../2009/01/lee-sanders.html" target="_blank">Lee Sanders&#8217;</a> post <a href="../../../2009/04/so-im-trying-out-this-blog-for-very.html" target="_blank">&#8216;To Flit or Not to Flit&#8217;</a>.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;m a lot more like <a href="../../../2009/05/joe-trapanese.html" target="_blank"> Joe Trapenese</a> in his comment below the aforementioned post &#8211; <span style="font-style: italic;">compartmentalized.</span> I&#8217;m a firm believer that, once the task for the day has been chosen, then being completely immersed in that project and that project alone gets the best music out there.</p>
<p>Getting the music out there on time, to schedule, up to standard, requires focus. 100% concentration on the project at hand. I&#8217;ve found that, without that focus, the work suffers. Turn twitter and email off. If you really need to churn out the notes, turn off your mobile phone (sorry, US readers, cellphone!). Ignore the landline phone, turn off the ringer if you can. Stick a note on your door, &#8216;no interruptions on pain of death!&#8217; And so on, and so on.</p>
<h2>Organize Your Time</h2>
<p>Be ruthlessly organized. Take a little time to plot your schedule realistically. Because I know I work compartmentally, I group specific projects into days, or better still into weeks.</p>
<p>What time of day are you most productive? Are you an <a href="http://www.heather-fenoughty.com/blog/2009/03/20/early-bird-or-night-owl" target="_blank">early bird or a night owl</a>? Schedule your creative and admin tasks accordingly.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prioritize</span><br />
What tasks have you to do that are important (seriously, though, what&#8217;s more important than writing music? ok, ok, family, exercise, blah blah blah ;-) )? What&#8217;s urgent? What&#8217;s neither (then why is it on the list? Come on, you gotta write five minutes of music today!)?</p>
<p><a href="http://onstartups.com/home/tabid/3339/bid/8853/Startup-Conversations-With-Myself-What-Should-I-Work-On.aspx" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s a useful post by a chap who&#8217;s struggling with prioritising his tasks</a>. Though it&#8217;s geared towards more general Startup Entrepeneur types, there&#8217;s a lot of relevant points for us busy composers.</p>
<p>You can be seriously anal with this sort of organization if that floats your boat. Back in uni, one of my lecturers recommended that you decide specifically which cues you&#8217;ll compose on which day during your schedule right after the spotting session. You work on that cue on that day until it&#8217;s finished, no matter how long it takes. Conversely, as a reward for finishing a cue earlier than expected, instead of carrying on with the next scheduled cue early, stop work for the day.</p>
<p>Personally, I like to set myself a specific duration of music which has to be written by the end of the working day rather than specific cues. Which allows me the freedom to do a sort of flitting, I suppose, between similar cues, without being completely restricted.</p>
<h2>Task switching</h2>
<p>One thing I&#8217;ve discovered is that it&#8217;s really tricky to switch between composing projects quickly during the same day. Mike Carey, fabulous novel and comic author of various titles for Hellblazer amongst others says that, ideally, sticking to one project-per-day is the ideal formula, and from experience this year I would have to agree. <a href="http://mikeandpeter.com/2009/07/a-whole-lot-of-marvel-stuff%E2%80%A6/comment-page-1/#comment-189" target="_blank">Read his comment here.</a></p>
<p>While it takes maybe 15 minutes or so to get into that &#8216;flow&#8217; state of pure concentration when starting the first composing task of the day, it can take anywhere up to an hour or more to get my head into gear if I have to switch between projects during that same day; the tunes in my head are still from the first project. And that&#8217;s a couple of hours we can ill-afford to waste if there&#8217;s a way around it, by careful planning and blocking of time to ensure the project-per-day rule.</p>
<h2>&#8216;Gateway&#8217; Activity</h2>
<p>But if you&#8217;re really stuffed for time, Mike Carey suggests creating an intentional &#8216;gateway&#8217; activity to switch between projects: re-reading (or listening) to previous completed project-specific work, listening to a piece of music that puts you in the right moodstate, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Heck &#8211; go for a walk or take a nap and really delineate the time between the two projects definitively. This is great, practical, common-sense stuff that really does work.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve recently found leaving a cue deliberately half-finished for the next time I start to work on that project is rather a sneaky way of getting the brain into gear without having to start from that initially difficult &#8216;blank-page&#8217; scenario. I&#8217;ll write a note in a marker on the timeline to myself &#8211; &#8216;fix timing here&#8217;, &#8216;check instrumentation&#8217;, etc. Because that cue appeared to take less time to write than it would have if it had been started from scratch in one sitting, it&#8217;ll have a positive feedback affect and seems to create momentum to push me into the next cue a little bit more easily than had I not gone through this process.</p>
<h2>Get a Head Start</h2>
<p>As much as possible, be involved in the project as early as possible.</p>
<p>This is easier said than done as often, as composers, we have no say in how late in the day we&#8217;re approached to work on a film or other media project. I&#8217;m a firm believer that the subconscious is a much more useful creativity tool than it&#8217;s given credit for, and that the longer I can give it the task to come up with themes and sounds and palettes and tones for a given project the better, without necessarily actually writing a note until final cut.</p>
<p>Which segues nicely onto a sticky subject&#8230; composing to picture before it is locked off.</p>
<p>Love it or hate it, this is generally the reality now: a necessity in these days of dwindling time-scales for post-production sound. All I can say is that, whilst this is a less than ideal scenario, it&#8217;s something to accept, to get used to and try to work to your advantage.</p>
<p>Keep the cues as fluid as possible, simplify your orchestration so that you can keep all the cues in one arrangement file for as long as possible before the computer starts to grind to a halt, and you have to save cues to separate files, and keep in touch with the editor and director to see which edits are likely to remain into the locked cut.</p>
<h2>Delegate</h2>
<p>Spread the love! Dish out the lower-level tasks such as basic sound design, recording (even the cleaning) etc., to someone that costs less for you to pay in terms of money than it would cost for you in time. <a style="font-weight: normal;" href="../../../2009/07/you-need-help-or-do-you-part-i.html" target="_blank">Deane Ogden&#8217;s post here</a> gives way more useful information on this than ever I could!</p>
<h2>In Conclusion&#8230;</h2>
<p>I realise that getting the work through the door is often a tricky enough prospect without worrying about how to juggle several projects at once. However, once you&#8217;re in that situation it&#8217;ll be very useful to have a couple of strategies in place to stay in control&#8230; and still enjoy the process!</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t forget to turn your phone, email and Tweetdeck back on when your done. There may be another project lined up just waiting for you to accept it ;-)</p>

<div><strong>What&#8217;s your batting average? </strong></div>
<div>Or, rather, how many minutes of finished music can you crank out in a day?</div>
<div><em>Note: for &#8216;crank out&#8217;, read: craft, create, splurge, sketch, mix, master, etc. &#8211; I&#8217;m being deliberately vague here to leave the forum open ;-)</em></div>
<div>It&#8217;s important for planning your workflow and schedule to know what your average is. I read in the comments (really sorry, can&#8217;t find it for the moment!) for one of the recent posts here on SCOREcast that one chap knows what his music-making output is <em>per hour</em> &#8211; that&#8217;s super-aware!</div>
<div>I know for a fact that I make more usable music in the earlier hours of the day, and that later hours are best used for more low-level tasks, admin etc, so this hourly rate varies so much to not be a useful tool for me&#8230; but is it for you?</div>
<div>Also, on longer projects (as Deane et al have already stated) as the musical themes and flavour get under your skin, writing gets faster towards the end of the project. This is useful to know if only for your sanity at the start of the project when you&#8217;re looking at a blank sequence!</div>
<div>But, on the whole, knowing your daily <em>average</em> is most useful, I find. I know that on one day I may only make 2 minutes of decent score and the rest is waffle, but on another day there may be a new 10-minutes-worth of glorious musical loveliness, mixed and mastered, perfectly synced to score (though, trust me, this is more rare ;-) ). I can&#8217;t predict from one day to the next which it&#8217;ll be, but I do know that over a period of time, say, a month, it&#8217;ll be clearer what the per-day average is, and I can use that to plan the next project.</div>
<div>I used to average about a minute (if I&#8217;m completely honest, that was on a good day, if you know what I mean) when I first started out many years ago. Now it&#8217;s up to about 5 minutes or so.</div>
<div>So, let me know: what&#8217;s <em><strong>your</strong></em> batting average?</div>

Does it just bug the ever-loving crap out you, like it does me, when you play your hard work for your director only to have him or her look at you blankly and utter the words &#8220;That just doesn&#8217;t work for me&#8221;?</p>
<p>I hate hearing those words come out of my director&#8217;s mouth. I want him or her to be pleased on first listen. Of course, it doesn&#8217;t always work that way and it is our job as the composer to find out why it doesn&#8217;t work that way. Music is so subjective and so personal that I often wonder privately things I&#8217;d never share with anyone, like &#8220;Who beat the hell out of this director so bad as a child to make him not like this cue for this scene?&#8221;</p>
<p>I have traversed far and wide to search out all possible answers to the question as to why, if you line five directors up against a wall and ask them to watch a scene with music, will you get five differing answers from each. This, of course, is an unanswerable question&#8230; perhaps answered only by discovering why *you* hear music the way you hear it and particularly why certain music, to your ears, would never fit in a certain scene.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all sat and listened to film scores independent of film to hear what others are doing or to study the greats and learn from them. The problem with that — and arguably, the problem with the concept of &#8220;film music critics&#8221; — is that the purpose and function of a piece of film music is essentially null and void when divorced from picture. With that rational, the very act of listening to a piece of film detached from the picture from whence it came is only half the story. It might be a nice listening experience, but you are still only getting part of the intended result.</p>
<p>My girlfriend is a <a class="zem_slink" title="Costume designer" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costume_designer">costume designer</a>. Our lives are a whirlwind of film events, one after the other, hers then mine then hers then mine. Recently, for the first time, I scored a film where she was also the principle wardrobe supervisor during production. It was a great experience seeing her styling and coloring choices explode onscreen while my music passed by in the underscore. As creatives, our workflows are similar, with slight differences. When I am working on menial administrative tasks like cutting demos, returning emails, or prepping my assistant&#8217;s schedule for the next week, I listen to film scores via my iTunes library. In another part of the house is my her workspace. When she is taking care of all of the administrative duties that her business requires, she watches movies on DVD or our Apple TV&#8230; with the volume turned <em>off</em>.</p>
<p>I always found this incredibly interesting&#8230; she watches movies with no sound. Seems weird, until you remember that she&#8217;s not listening for score, FX, or dialog&#8230; she&#8217;s looking at <em>costumes</em>.</p>
<p>Her process — in its entirety, from conception of a costume to the final product being fitted on the actor — completely blows me away and fascinates me. I have taken many cues from the way she works and incorporated many of her routines into my way of working as a composer. In addition, I have taken the way that she studies film and tried to apply it to the way I study film. What has resulted is a mash-up of looking at film and music in an effort to better understand why it is that music works why it is that sometimes it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Here is what it looks like: From time to time — and *only* with time to burn, mind you — I&#8217;ll put on an old movie or a recent release and turn the sound completely <em>off</em>. Then I&#8217;ll launch my iTunes library and set the filter controls so that only MY music shows up in the browser. As the film plays, I&#8217;ll &#8220;temp&#8221; my music into the film by simply pushing &#8220;PLAY&#8221; when a scene comes up that I feel needs music. I&#8217;ll experiment — I&#8217;ll put things in that I think would fit well, or put things in that are completely from another genre just to see what works and what&#8230; um&#8230; doesn&#8217;t. (Imagine &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" title="Seven (film)" rel="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt114369/">SE7EN</a>&#8221; with tunes from that <em>sports comedy</em> you just finished!)</p>
<p>This process teaches me a TON. Not only do I learn what not to do, but I have also learned that in film music, and filmmaking in general, there are *no* rules. Everything is on the table. Therefore, sometimes, a serious scene works better with a comedic score or a slightly quirkier feel to the music. Conversely, we&#8217;ve all seen many great film composer legends play against comedy with a serious tone in the accompanying score.</p>
<p>Playing around with these kinds of things really enables you to learn &#8220;privately&#8221; and make mistakes on your own dime that canand should NEVER be made on your director&#8217;s.</p>
<p>This is one small, and maybe silly, way to &#8220;think&#8221; about how film music works and how it won&#8217;t&#8230; but it <em>&#8220;works for me&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p>What works for you?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five years ago today, one of the greatest melodists to ever pick up the baton left us.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000025/">Jerry Goldsmith</a> was not only a master interpreter of film, but also one of the greatest creators of film music to ever grace the medium. Goldsmith&#8217;s music, whether by accident or pure purpose, was a major influence on many of us in our decisions to take on this career and try to reach even a fraction of the height that he was able to during his time at the podium.</p>

<p class="zemanta-img zemanta-action-dragged" style="margin: 1em; float: right; display: block;"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jerry%2BGoldsmith"><img style="display: block;" src="http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/2148656.jpg" alt="Jerry Goldsmith" /></a><span class="zemanta-img-attribution"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jerry%2BGoldsmith">Jerry Goldsmith</a> via <a href="http://www.lasftm.com">last.fm</a></span></p>
<p>matic writing. It will surely be argued that <a class="zem_slink" title="John Williams" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002354/" rel="imdb">John Williams</a> is perhaps the last &#8220;living legend&#8221; in film music. However, I felt that once Jerry was gone, even Williams began to rest on his laurels a little, and with the latest <span style="font-style: italic;">Indiana Jones</span> film, trail a bit into what I&#8217;ve heard termed as &#8220;smash-and-grab&#8221; scoring.</p>
<p>I first heard the term &#8220;smash-and-grab&#8221; in a lecture during my second year at USC. The lecturer was referring to the types of scores that emphasize bombastic and chaotic &#8220;noise&#8221; over carefully-crafted, thematic writing. You know, the kind that almost every big-budget studio feature has affixed to their tent-pole summer films these days!</p>
<p>It seems that now, more than ever, that the recipe for &#8220;scoring&#8221; is to hold down a key on a controller to loop a gigantic taiko sequence, then, on the second pass, hold another key down and add the Absynth pad to give the new &#8220;cue&#8221; some depth. Furthermore, with the advent of things like &#8220;Symphobia&#8221; and the forthcoming &#8220;Hollywood Strings&#8221; libraries, it is easier than ever to be lazy and still sound amazing. It seems lately that even with the most effort put forth, a composer might write a bare theme, but nothing that is hummable as you walk out of the theater or attaches any kind of musical memory to the film for the audience.</p>
<p>In the wake of Deane&#8217;s question from <a href="../../../2009/07/fixers.html">yesterday</a> about a score&#8217;s affect on a film, I wonder what it is that has made the &#8220;smash-and-grab&#8221; score so trendy lately. Who started the downward spiral and why are the studios so happy to buy in? Is it because audiences have been dumbed down so much that they really do not care if a film&#8217;s music leaves any kind of lasting effect? Or is it because we have passed the point of being able to truly enjoy a film for &#8220;entertainment&#8217;s sake&#8221; and we therefore do not have the capacity as humans anymore to appreciate a visual stimuli that has an aural one accompanying it?</p>
<p>When I browse <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Reporter</span></a> or read <span style="font-style: italic;"><a class="zem_slink" title="Variety (magazine)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_%28magazine%29" rel="wikipedia">Variety</a></span> and see which composers are working on which films, I see a new group of composers who are making a name for themselves as &#8220;smash-and-grab&#8221; film composers. It saddens me greatly to see poster after poster at the theater with any of these composers&#8217; names in the block because I cannot help but think that once I get my shot at a large feature, their method of churning out these awful scores is going to be the norm. Will that mean that I am going to be asked to imitate a cheap sounding score? What will that do to my value as a new guy trying to get my career out of first gear? There are many composers who are basically not hirable due to that very syndrome already!</p>
<p>In my memory, there has not been a truly hummable theme that has come out of a film score in the last five years. If you can think of one, please speak up, because I honestly cannot. My hope is that someone here, in the SCOREcast community, will be the next great writer to give us a memorable theme along the lines of Goldsmith&#8217;s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066206/"><span style="font-style: italic;">Patton</span></a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060177/"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Blue Max</span></a>, or even his later work on the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a class="zem_slink" title="Rambo (film)" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462499/" rel="imdb">Rambo</a></span> series and <a class="zem_slink" style="font-style: italic;" title="Star Trek" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek" rel="wikipedia">Star Trek</a> franchise.</p>
<p>Is there a market for thematic writing in film today, and if so, for those us who are realistically 5+ years away from entering the industry in earnest, will it still be there when we finally arrive and need it to be?</p>

Yes, I had the ubiquitous STAR WARS (1977) experience almost identical to Lee&#8217;s and a host of others of my generation. My parents&#8217; album, which I listened to as a young boy, is still hanging on the wall of my studio which I occasionally will get down and listen to. Other scores like PATTON (1970), VERTIGO (1958), EMPIRE OF THE SUN (1987), and JURASSIC PARK (1993), just to name a few were all responsible for sprouting their own branches on my tree of film music adoration.</p>
<p>However influential those listening experiences were for me as a child, none of them would be the score I would pick as being <span style="font-style: italic;">the</span> score which made me want to devote my entire life to the craft.</p>
<p>That designation is reserved exclusively for <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000384/" title="Danny Elfman" rel="imdb">Danny Elfman</a>&#8216;s modern classic <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099487/" title="Edward Scissorhands" rel="imdb">EDWARD SCISSORHANDS</a> (1990).</p>
<p>I was in high school at the time and had, throughout my life, developed a rich passion for both movies and music. As a band nerd since fifth grade playing the tenor saxophone, creating melodies on my horn was always more interesting to me than playing those written by others. I had deep down inside a desire to compose but I never knew what that meant or what I would do to satiate such desires. I wasn&#8217;t sure what I wanted to write or what I wanted to express.</p>
<p>Then I saw EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and a light bulb went off. Actually it was more like two speeding locomotives, one representing my love of movies, the other my love for music, had collided with such force that the resulting fusion impacted the course of my life forever.</p>
<p>I realized that <span style="font-style: italic;">this</span> is the kind of music I wanted to write. <span style="font-style: italic;">This</span> was how I wanted to express myself. The thought of sitting in a darkened theater responsible for breathing life into the dead corpse of an unscored film thrilled me beyond anything I had comprehended before. All the pieces of the puzzle fell into place and life suddenly become a lot clearer.</p>
<p>As for Danny Elfman&#8217;s magnum opus itself, it remains one of my very favorite scores to date. So much of it achieves a level of perfection not easily attained in the film scoring community. The marriage of Elfman&#8217;s score and Tim Burton&#8217;s story and pictures is one thought only to exist in fairy tales.

<p>I don’t know if this is a true story. <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000009/" rel="imdb" title="Richard Burton">Richard Burton</a> was playing the lead in a comedy on Broadway.

Did Mankiewicz break down in tears? I’ve watched that film numerous times and still cry when the final music cue enters. Today, a director hears a mock up of the score long before it gets recorded &#8211; all of which strangely leads us back to Richard Burton.</p>
<p>The temp music editor can have a profound effect on setting the emotional and musical tone for a film long before the composer sinks his teeth into it. In an admittedly dangerous comparison, the temp music editor can play Richard Burton &#8211; so long as the director loves what is provided by way of temp music. The good news is the music editor can feel the power Burton had. The bad news? It doesn’t last long, so don’t let it get to your head. In fact, the best temp score retains its value with yesterday’s newspaper. On the brighter side, one good job leads to another. With the tasks of pleasing a difficult director, not alienating the composer, and keeping the studio happy &#8211; why would anyone want to edit temp music? I will provide a lengthy introductory answer, but first, welcome to SCOREcast!</p>
<p>It’s a privilege to be the music editor contributor. My goals are: To provide some working advice on the politics, the creativity, and the inner workings of music editing. If I run out of sage advice I may write war stories about the good old days. My specialty is temp music although I have worked with some of the finest composers in the business. I hope to keep the material as interactive as possible, therefore comments and topic suggestions are most welcome.</p>
<p>If it helps me to admit, or the reader to know, I am without the impressive music degrees that many of my peers hold. In short, I am an autodidact. I have played guitar for many years and also compose. I’m not the smartest guy on the block, but I’m pretty good at my job. <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003299/" rel="imdb" title="Marc Shaiman">Marc Shaiman</a> once dubbed me “An idiot savant”. From Marc that was a compliment, though surely he would joke otherwise.</p>
<p>When I started apprenticing I had one mantra: Make money. Although raised in the film industry, I was the proud kid who didn’t want to follow in his father’s writer-producer footsteps &#8211; until I got a look at one of his pay-stubs. (Told ya I wasn’t the smartest guy on the block.) Up to then I had so many jobs I could qualify for the Guinness Book of World Records. I was married and supporting four kids while working at Ralph&#8217;s Warehouse in Compton. (And that was a good job.) The day I saw his earnings I begged my Dad to get me into the his business. He called Rocky Moriana Sr. who he knew from the Paramount mail room where they had begun their careers. They made a trade; me into the Editor’s Guild, and Rocky’s son into S.A.G.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SkrEQW6QxCI/AAAAAAAAAI4/aDQMTcbPBhk/s1600-h/alien_movie_poster.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SkrEQW6QxCI/AAAAAAAAAI4/aDQMTcbPBhk/s320/alien_movie_poster.jpg" border="0" /></a>As an apprentice I made more money than I had ever made in my life. For a few months the mantra was good. I worked ninety hours a week rewinding reels, preparing fill leader for the various sound and music editors, and running heavy hand-carts of film from one end of the studio to the other. It was grunt work, but I enjoyed everything about it. If I could only figure out what all those editors were doing. There was no Wikipedia.</p>
<p>After several months, with no inspiration other than money, I became discouraged at the relentless assembly line. The epiphanic day occurred when I sneaked onto the Fox scoring stage and watched <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000025/" rel="imdb" title="Jerry Goldsmith">Jerry Goldsmith</a> conduct <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;</span>Alien<span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;</span>. I fell in love with movie making and though I was raised in the business, I saw it in a fresh light of creativity and magic. How lucky was I to breathe the same air with those great musicians? I am still excited to sit on a scoring stage, or cut a music cue and see it on a fifty foot screen.</p>
<p>Why one would want to edit music? You tell me.</p>

My gosh, I thought, there are so many, and they all just blur together, I can&#8217;t think of any in particular.</p>
<p>But no.  There <span style="font-style: italic;">is </span>one that stands out.  I&#8217;m almost embarrassed to talk about it, because it goes <span style="font-style: italic;">so </span>far back, to 1961.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Side_Story_%28film%29"><span style="font-style: italic;">West Side Story</span></a> &#8211; scored by <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Bernstein" title="Leonard Bernstein" rel="wikipedia">Leonard Bernstein</a>.</p>
<p>Now, <span style="font-style: italic;">West Side Story</span> wasn&#8217;t originally a film &#8212; it was a Broadway musical, based on a novel, in turn based on <span style="font-style: italic;">Romeo and Juliet</span>.  But it was a <span style="font-style: italic;">huge</span> success when it came to the screen, winning 10 Academy Awards, not to mention blowing me away.  <span style="font-style: italic;">West Side Story </span>was really different from anything I&#8217;d ever seen or heard.  One of those 70 mm spectacles that you don&#8217;t see these days.  The dancing was really cool, and the lyrics outrageous, but it was Bernstein&#8217;s<span style="font-style: italic;"> music </span>that really stuck with me.  Even today, almost half a century later (is that possible?), I still remember the most minute details.</p>
<p>But, unlike many of my fellow SCOREcast contributors, I <span style="font-style: italic;">didn&#8217;t</span> immediately think, <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>I gotta write music like that, gotta be a film composer</span>.  At that time, I wanted to be a <span style="font-style: italic;">singer</span>, and Bernstein&#8217;s music just kind of hit me in the pit of my stomach.  A lot of it was <span style="font-style: italic;">hormones</span>, I think &#8212; stars in my eyes.  After all, I was about 13 when <span style="font-style: italic;">West Side Story</span> came out.  I wanted to be &#8230; <span style="font-style: italic;">Tony</span>.  And, of course, I imagined myself singing to the likes of <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000081/" title="Natalie Wood" rel="imdb">Natalie Wood</a> (Maria).</p>
<p>My high school put on a musical every year, and I kept hoping the music department would decide to do <span style="font-style: italic;">West Side Story</span> and that I&#8217;d get the chance to be Tony, even if I wasn&#8217;t playing opposite Natalie.  It didn&#8217;t come to pass.</p>
<p>But I kept hoping.  I had a copy of the soundtrack album, and I went over and over the songs.  One 60&#8242;s morning around 10 AM, when I thought nobody was home, I was <span style="font-style: italic;">being</span> Tony, singing <span style="font-style: italic;">Maria</span> at the top of my lungs when, to my extreme embarassment, I heard somebody yell, &#8220;Will ya shut up, I&#8217;m trying to sleep!&#8221;  Sorry, Dad.</p>
<p>[It's interesting to learn that I was in good company in my quest to become Tony.   According to <span style="font-style: italic;">Wikipedia, </span>when the part of Tony was being cast for the film, the list of eager contenders included <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000062/" title="Elvis Presley" rel="imdb">Elvis Presley</a>, Warren Beatty, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002147/" title="Tab Hunter" rel="imdb">Tab Hunter</a>, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000578/" title="Anthony Perkins" rel="imdb">Anthony Perkins</a>, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0848560/" title="Russ Tamblyn" rel="imdb">Russ Tamblyn</a>, Burt Reynolds, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001148/" title="Troy Donahue" rel="imdb">Troy Donahue</a>, Bobby Darin, Richard Chamberlain, Gary Lockwood, and <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000937/" title="Richard Beymer" rel="imdb">Richard Beymer</a>.  Beymer was eventually selected.]</p>
<p>Things have a way of morphing over time.  I ended up going off in a completely non-musical direction in the years that followed, with Tony locked up somewhere inside.  I didn&#8217;t re-emerge until several decades had passed and I realized I had to let him out &#8212; that it wasn&#8217;t too late.  It was then &#8212; about 10 years ago &#8212; that a new musical journey began for me.  No, I probably wasn&#8217;t going to be Tony, but I could still <span style="font-style: italic;">create </span>music that moved me the way I&#8217;d been moved so many years before.  I began to put the pieces together, one after another, until it dawned on me that composing for film and other media was a viable as a new career path.  The rest is history still in the making.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">There&#8217;s a time for us &#8230;</span>

Film music has always intrigued me in that a car chase scene or a love scene can spark my interest. Not just that it&#8217;s there in the scene, but that something inside of me — my “emotimeter” — turns on. </span></span>
<p style="font-family: georgia;font-family:georgia;" class="MsoNormal" ><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Like most of the contributors and composers on SCOREcast, we all have had the “Wow” experience&#8230; The moment that you said, “I want to do this”. It’s that emotional connection; even though it may come to us in very different ways, it connects us. </span></span></p>
<p style="font-family: georgia;font-family:georgia;" class="MsoNormal" ><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span">I won’t bore you with my “Music is the Universal Language” diatribe, but it really does communicate across boundaries and in this case without words. I always listened attentively to the score in films; it always kind of stuck out to me. I always noticed what was happening, behind the action of the movie. </span></span></p>
<p style="font-family: georgia;font-family:georgia;" class="MsoNormal" ><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Now, <span style="font-style: italic;">The <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Lion-King-Special-Various-Artists/dp/B0000CABJ2%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0000CABJ2" title="The Lion King: Special Edition" rel="amazon">Lion King</a></span> had been out for a while, and this particular day I was helping a buddy of mine in his studio. He had one of the first surround sound production facilities in the state and we where doing some calibration and listening tests. He happened to have The Lion King and we where listening to this in surround through the system making adjustments. After the gigantic opening song “Circle of Life”, I continued to sit there listening to the rest of the score as the movie progressed. A few minutes later, I had switched mentally from listening to the levels of the surround system that we where calibrating, to being engrossed in the score and how it reinforced the movie and the story line. I was lost, in a good way. My “emotimeter” was on in full, and I did not want to leave that studio seat. </span></span></p>
<p style="font-family: georgia;font-family:georgia;" class="MsoNormal" ><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span">I remember that day as vividly as today. Normally I don’t admit that I’m a softy and sometimes cry at “Chick Flicks”, but at a few points of the movie I found myself getting choked up, trying to hold back the tears. Something was moving me inside and I could not get over the music that I was hearing. The thing was, it wasn’t any particular piece, cue, or moment&#8230; it was the whole thing. The entire package. </span></span></p>
<p style="font-family: georgia;font-family:georgia;" class="MsoNormal" ><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span">I had to see who the person was who had created this music and the score. I had never heard of <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001877/" title="Hans Zimmer" rel="imdb">Hans Zimmer</a> up to this point. At this point in my career, I never followed that industry or side of the music business. My first thought was, &#8220;What a cool name!&#8221; Hans. I started to research more about him. I thought, &#8220;Anybody who can bring me to tears and full of emotion in an animated film must be pretty good.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p style="font-family: georgia;font-family:georgia;" class="MsoNormal" ><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span"> Later I had learned that he had won the OSCAR in 1994 for best score for this movie. He obviously moved a bunch of other people as well.<br /></span></span></p>
<p style="font-family: georgia;font-family:georgia;" class="MsoNormal" ><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span">So, I would like to thank Hans Zimmer for touching me that day enough to not only spark my curiosity to start listening to more scores in movies, but also to want to be one of the people who creates this music that moves people. I want to make people feel how I did that day watching and listening in the studio. Now, if I only had only half the talent of Hans (and maybe his composing rig!), I might be happier. </span></span></p>
<p style="font-family: georgia;font-family:georgia;" class="MsoNormal" ><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span">And that fact that he worked with the &#8220;Buggles&#8221; and appeared in the video &#8220;Video Killed the Radio Star&#8221; also did it for me.</span></span></p>
<p style="font-family: georgia;font-family:georgia;" class="MsoNormal" ><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span">LOL</span></span></p>
<p style="font-family: georgia;font-family:georgia;" class="MsoNormal" ><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Thanks Hans!</span></span></p>
<p style="font-family: georgia;font-family:georgia;" class="MsoNormal" ><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Now where is my 1983 Casio?</span></span></p>

I keep coming back to this time and time again, as I think Andrew really hit the nail on the head:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;I always wonder if [people] confuse their influences with their favorite composers, which are not always the same thing. I’ll put it this way, influences run more deeply and subconsciously than ‘my fave five’ composers. For instance, I love <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky" rel="wikipedia" title="Igor Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a>. And I love to say that I love Stravinsky; it’s a win-win. However, the reality is that going to see ‘Back to the Future’ when I was a kid had a much bigger impact on me musically. Let’s just say I REALLY wanted to play Johnny B. Goode as quickly as possible. In the long term, Igor has sustained me, but Marty got me on the road.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_in_Black" rel="wikipedia" title="Men in Black">Men in Black</a>&#8221; score &#8220;sustained&#8221; me, but also &#8220;got me on the road&#8221;.  I&#8217;m showing how young I am here, as most others would probably cite older films as their gateway, but I think this was the first film score I had heard that captured my imagination and showed me the possibilities of music in film.  I don&#8217;t know what it was in the score that struck a chord (pardon the pun) somewhere inside me, but it definitively still resonates the same special feeling to this day when I listen to it.  I think I was 11 when I first heard it, and I immediately got the soundtrack for my birthday &#8211; the first CD I ever had! I couldn&#8217;t put it down and just kept listening to it.  I couldn&#8217;t believe the sounds <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000384/" rel="imdb" title="Danny Elfman">Elfman</a> was creating and I was hearing.  The orchestral colours he used, the mixture of styles and sounds, the epic and whacky mood all mixed into one.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s funny is, I created a track about a year or two ago and subconsciously had written a section of music which was nearly identical to a part of the score of Men in Black &#8211; even though I hadn&#8217;t listened to the MIB score in about 10 years! I was sitting there scratching my head thinking&#8230;.&#8221;why does this sound so familiar?&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t believe that something I had heard a decade ago had influenced me so deeply, that I could subconsciously write music based on it.</p>
<p>From those first four deep notes on the cello, we know we&#8217;re in for a ride.  In my opinion, Elfman&#8217;s music for this opening sequence is close to perfection and is a prime example of excellent film scoring &#8211; every time I hear that opening sequence, I can see the dragonfly buzzing along the highway, swooping up and down, then getting splattered all over the windscreen as we see on screen.  And that in my opinion is one of a number of things, that makes excellent film music &#8211; when you hear that cue, you immediately remember what it was referring to in the film.</p>

My &#8220;Gateway Score&#8221; experience may seem overlay dramatic and romanticized to everyone but me, but this is how it happened.</p>
<p>When Chariots of Fire came out in 1981, my parents decided we would all go as a family and see it. To 10-year-old me, that was code for <b><i>bo-ring</i></b>. So there I was sitting in the theatre &#8211; we went to the Cinedomes in Orange &#8211; the best theatre around in &#8217;81, at least that I knew of &#8211; the lights went down and the film started with this boring monologue &#8211; a poetic eulogy no less, at a funeral, and I started to get comfortable to go to sleep. But before I could the scene changed to these guys running on the beach and this music faded in, something I did not <i>at all </i>expect. Synthesizers, in a <i>movie</i>?  
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_P3p3I805INU/SkqHQaOv6UI/AAAAAAAAABQ/JAKwdr0Q7wc/s1600-h/200px-Chariots_of_fire.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5353239823072094530" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_P3p3I805INU/SkqHQaOv6UI/AAAAAAAAABQ/JAKwdr0Q7wc/s320/200px-Chariots_of_fire.jpg" style="float: right; height: 311px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; width: 200px;" /></a>Then that first bass note. If you&#8217;ve seen Chariots of Fire at least a couple times, you know the note I&#8217;m talking about. That one single note flipped a switch in me. No exaggeration, that&#8217;s what it felt like. The note actually got an audible &#8220;Oooo&#8221; from the audience too, so it wasn&#8217;t just me. So I was instantly captivated. Funny, I still didn&#8217;t care about the film (at the time) but I simply couldn&#8217;t wait to hear the next cue.</div>
<div></div>
<p>
<div>After the movie ended, I needed more; I had to hear it again, but I wasn&#8217;t yet aware of &#8220;soundtracks&#8221;. So it was a great gift when my dad bought me a cassette of the soundtrack. Later, we also bought the movie on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videodisc">Videodisc</a> (yeah, not Laserdisc) which gave me even more music &#8211; the boy&#8217;s choir in the Cambridge scene, the cool training scene showing the evil American team, and so on. I ended up dubbing my soundtrack onto another cassette, inserting these additional cues where they belonged in the film, making my own &#8220;Chariots of Fire &#8211; extended version&#8221;.</div>
<p>
<div></div>
<div>It still wasn&#8217;t enough. We had a piano in the house (my sister was taking lessons) and I ended up sitting for hours with my cheap tape player, teaching myself to play some of the cues. Only when I could play the main title theme and the boys&#8217; choir cue did I feel this nagging need for more begin to subside.</div>
<p>
<div></div>
<div>If that&#8217;s not a Gateway score, I don&#8217;t know what is.</div>

<p>When Jai asked me to talk about my Gateway Score — the score album that really grabbed me as a child and convinced me that scoring films is what I HAD to do for a living — I sort of froze at the thought of the assignment.</p>
<p>&#8220;A real composer would talk about John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith, or Bernard Herrmann,&#8221; I thought to myself. &#8220;When everyone hears my pick (insert Adam Sandler&#8217;s famous little-boy-sad-face here)&#8230; <b><i>They&#8217;re all gonna laugh at me!</i></b>&#8220;</p>
<p>While I love action films and I flip out for science fiction on a pretty regular basis, I have always been the drama guy. I love a great drama, especially one that contains strong writing for the characters coupled by great performances. &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116695/" rel="imdb" title="Jerry Maguire">Jerry Maguire</a>&#8221; might be my favorite film of all-time, simply because of <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001081/" rel="imdb" title="Cameron Crowe">Cameron Crowe</a>&#8216;s ability to create characters of incredible depth which allowed each actor to carve out a performance of incredible depth. The story device used in &#8220;Jerry Maguire&#8221; — <i>rags-to-riches</i> followed by <i>life-lesson-learned</i> — is not new by any stretch of the imagination, yet is presented in a fresh and unique way, almost in reverse. &#8220;Jerry Maguire&#8221; is fundamentally an old-fashioned <i>dramedy</i>&#8230; a little bit of comedy, a lot bit of drama.</p>
<p>For me, the <i>dramedy</i> was perfected in the mid-to-late eighties by a guy named <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hughes_%28director%29" rel="wikipedia" title="John Hughes (director)">John Hughes</a>. Hughes somehow brought the irreverence of Reagan-generation punk attitude to his filmmaking, creating characters that I could completely identify with. &#8220;Pretty In Pink&#8221;, &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Club" rel="wikipedia" title="The Breakfast Club">The Breakfast Club</a>&#8220;, and of course, &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferris_Bueller%27s_Day_Off" rel="wikipedia" title="Ferris Bueller's Day Off">Ferris Bueller&#8217;s Day Off</a>&#8221; immediately come to mind. But I didn&#8217;t become acutely aware of film music until my formative years teaching myself piano in the mid-to-late 1980&#8242;s. By then, everybody was trying to be John Hughes, and the dramedy was THE genre to make if you were a filmmaker. Needless to say, I was digging most of them.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SkqOGF6-WYI/AAAAAAAAAIo/CjZOom9VAI0/s1600-h/secret_of_my_success.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SkqOGF6-WYI/AAAAAAAAAIo/CjZOom9VAI0/s320/secret_of_my_success.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>I was also really taking notice and studying up on who was scoring all of them. Ira Newborn was huge back then, and the concept of the pop soundtrack album was really starting to take off. This all started to happen at about the same time a school buddy of mine who was also into film (future director Bryan Curb, who I would later work with here in Hollywood) gave me a cassette tape of David Foster&#8217;s &#8220;The Symphony Sessions&#8221;. That album contained a track called &#8220;Water Fountain&#8221;, which was the love theme from the 1987 Michael J. Fox dramedy &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093936/" rel="imdb" title="The Secret of My Succe$s">The Secret of My Success</a>&#8220;. Foster was hired to write the score for the film after director Herbert Ross heard his music for the smash hit &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090060/" rel="imdb" title="St. Elmo's Fire (film)">St. Elmo&#8217;s Fire</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>David Foster&#8217;s &#8220;Water Fountain&#8221; theme really knocked me over, both on the soundtrack album to the film as well as the re-recording from &#8220;The Symphony Sessions&#8221;, which featured Foster on piano backed by the Jeremy Lubbock conducted Vancouver Symphony. Back when thematic writing was still a practice that involved notes rather than &#8220;patches&#8221;, Foster&#8217;s melody is a beautifully crafted representation of a major modal theme that is complex in its simplicity.</p>
<p>The rest of the score is motivic of both the &#8220;Water Fountain&#8221; theme and a secondary theme that Foster called the &#8220;Gazebo&#8221; theme, which is also just as lush and romantic as the former.</p>
<p>The fact the a lot of people don&#8217;t know that David Foster scored films as well as produced pop records in the 1980&#8242;s is dwarfed only by the number of people who would even be aware that &#8220;The Secret of My Success&#8221; had any kind of actual score in it to begin with. However, I&#8217;ve spent the majority of my career trying to write music that made me feel like I did when I first heard that &#8220;Water Fountain&#8221; theme.</p>
<p>Just when I think I&#8217;m getting close, I listen to it again and realize I have so far to go.</p>

My parents, in a moment of thrifty but well-intentioned genius, brought home the Electric Moog Orchestra LP for my consumption instead (!). I still have that album, by the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Maybe it was a sign, because I&#8217;ve been doing exactly that same thing—i.e., faking the sound of an orchestra with my synth rig—pretty much my whole career. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been specifically hired for again and again. So I have to thank the Electric Moog Orchestra for showing me the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">…But enough on that! <i>Star Wars</i> was for me what I suspect it is for many people of a certain age: the film score to end all film scores. The inspiration to get into this crazy business. <b>The Grail</b>, as it were. Although that&#8217;s a whole other John Williams score. :-)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">George Lucas calls the six <i>Star Wars</i> pictures an homage to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_film">serial adventure film</a>, a cinematic tradition that dates back to some of the earliest silent films (and reached its apex during the heyday of the Hollywood studio system). The scores bear that out; in fact, they&#8217;re crucial to making that connection. They are thematic, even leitmotivic. Their harmonic language is largely that of Romantic chromaticism. They are emotionally immediate and non-ironic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">So: Is this approach to film scoring even marginally relevant today? Is the contemporary audience so self-aware, so ironically detached, that this style of music has lost its ability to connect?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The curmudgeon in me wants to say that, sadly, we&#8217;ve moved on. Today&#8217;s scores are all about the pad and the Big Drummy Drummy… with a little reverb-soaked duduk on top (Protip: filmmakers love duduk! Can&#8217;t get enough of it!). Anything resembling a theme is straight-up heresy; traditional harmony is for suckers; the sound of a live orchestra is sort of hopelessly quaint. And on and on like that, until it starts to sound suspiciously like whining.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">But reports of the Death of Traditional Film Scoring are premature. Listen to any episode of <i>24 </i>for a great example. Sure, Sean Callery handles a lot of the tense dialog scenes with creepy atmospheric synth pads and the occasional low drum thud (and is extremely effective in doing so—maximum respect to Sean). But he also integrates cues that take advantage of the power of theme, and of conventional harmony, and of all the emotional connections we still feel when we hear an orchestra or simply a noble horn line (the <i>24</i> Main Title encapsulates this perfectly). He&#8217;s doing what composers have always done: integrating the old with the new, and finding ways to make it all connect with the audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Another example: Absolutely central to Michael Giacchino&#8217;s &#8220;sound&#8221; is the fact that he uses a Real Live Orchestra, recorded old-school by Dan Wallin. You can hear every bow, every articulation, because they&#8217;re <i>real</i>. Take a look at MG&#8217;s creative output over the last two years, and, besides wondering when the man sleeps, you can&#8217;t help but conclude that he&#8217;s massively relevant on quantity alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">As someone whose process often starts with themes and harmonies, I am happy and relieved to tell you: the influence of <i>Star Wars</i> is alive and well. The Force, to use the ending you must have seen coming a mile away, is still with us.</span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">As usual, this provocation seems just plain wrong on its face. Listening to soundtrack albums got me hooked this career in the first place—and I suspect it&#8217;s the same for many of you. Without them, I&#8217;d likely be blogging about corporate law, or foreign policy, or some other interest that I parlayed into a life&#8217;s work.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">On the other hand, maybe considering this provocation reminds us of the film score&#8217;s necessary subservience to picture… or where we should be spending our time (is Photoshopping an album cover really more important than meeting with a filmmaker?)… or to whether, in a world with torrents and Pirate Bays, soundtrack albums even make sense anymore.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Then, of course, there&#8217;s also the issue of &#8220;soundtrack album vs. score album.&#8221; Some people get picky about which is which… hop in here and let me know what this all suggests to you.</span></span></p>

<p>Admittedly this is my point of view, a conclusion drawn of my life experiences so far. They may change in the next ten years.  But, hey, so far being a bit of a <strong>&#8216;One-Man-Band&#8217;</strong> has worked for me, so it might just work for you<br />
;-)</p>
<h3>FOCUS</h3>
<p>Focusing on music and composition, and film music in particular, has never really been a problem for me. In fact, it&#8217;s practically borderline obsession. I cannot remember a time when I didn&#8217;t want to write or be involved somehow with the music of film.<br />
This led me to learn various instruments and then onto two music degrees, the latter in scoring picture, an invaluable experience, as it was here where I learned the similarities between composing music pieces and sound designing an entire soundtrack, using found or recorded sound to augment music or even be the basis for it.<br />
I took my narrow focus on just scoring film to the wider possibilities of, and the fun to be had with, film sound.<br />
After university I found even more so that diversifying my skill set led on to more contacts and opportunities. Recording sound on low budget short film sets led to an appreciation of well-recorded sound when I then brought them into the post-production studio&#8230; and also the necessity of learning ways of cleaning up less than optimal sound (that I vowed to record better the next time!).<br />
Using organizational and basic office skills as a production assistant in a local, small production office meant I also ended up being first choice for the recording and post-production sound, simply out of convenience for the producers, and they could pay me as a package deal, probably ending up cheaper for them than sourcing it out to separate facility houses.</p>
<h3>SKILLS</h3>
<p>Even if your office skills are pretty limited, the fact that you&#8217;re a composing for film means that you&#8217;ve got a pretty broad skillset in other areas as it is. In the beginning it&#8217;s vital to use them all to get you to that holy grail of composing for film (or theatre, television, commercials, whatever floats your boat).<br />
You&#8217;re probably pretty good with computers and related kit &#8211; get work in kit hire, and find out about all the films that are hiring kit perhaps by making friends with your regular clients.<br />
If you&#8217;ve been freelance or self-employed for any length of time, you&#8217;ll develop some pretty awesome motivational and organizational skills (if you don&#8217;t you won&#8217;t be in work very long!). How might you put those to good use in some line of work that may put you in the line of fire for a composing role? Or even pay the bills so you have enough free time to compose music and build up your credits?<br />
I found that working in music sequencers and timelines actually translates well to working in Macromedia Flash, which led to designing my own fancy website and then a few more for friends and friends of friends. After realizing that Flash websites get no love from search engines, some of the coding skills used in Flash translate over to working in html etc., which led to a little more web design.  Maybe you could design websites to fund your addiction to writing music for film?<br />
You probably play at least one instrument. Whether it&#8217;s through teaching or playing at functions, there&#8217;s easy cash to be made there, with very little time investment involved. You&#8217;ve already put in all the hard work learning to play the damn thing&#8230;<br />
Honestly&#8230; at the very least being able to offer not only composition but sound design, foley, and mixes on short films and contemporary theatre really has gotten me more work. If I can offer it as a package, I save the client hassle and quite a bit of dosh. It&#8217;s gotten me more credits, more contacts and lots more word-of-mouth recommendations than if all I could do was crank out the tunes.<br />
Or at the very least, it&#8217;s kept the roof over my head. And, let&#8217;s face it, more importantly, my studio. :-)</p>
<h3>JACK OF ALL TRADES?</h3>
<p>Does diversifying mean you become a &#8216;jack of all trades, master of none&#8217;? This really depends on you: how far are you willing to go to get the opportunities to put your foot on the ladder, or even later down the line, to continue to work in the industry when the credit crunch finally hits your neck of the woods (though this has yet to happen in mine, and I&#8217;m keeping fingers crossed it&#8217;ll continue this way. However, you never know what the future may bring &#8211; it&#8217;s always good to have contingencies!)?<br />
The trick is to not worry too much about being the greatest in the world at every single one of the skills you offer, but instead aim to be the best you can be at the ones you love and at least pretty competent at the ones that pay.<br />
Face it, even if you work only on composition, out of the billions of people on the planet there will always be someone who&#8217;s better than you, after all!<br />
Embrace this knowledge, work hard at getting better and enjoy the journey.<br />
Focus 100% on your role in the project at hand, learn everything you can from the experience, give it all you&#8217;ve got and you&#8217;ll come away from the experience better at that role than you were before. You may also come away feeling like you never want to do it again&#8230; but that&#8217;s a whole other post waiting to be written&#8230;<br />
<strong>FULL CIRCLE<br />
</strong><br />
It&#8217;s even got to the point now where I have so much work on, I&#8217;m able to outsource a little of the basic stuff like tracklaying and simple foley&#8230; which means I have more time to focus on the music, the sound design, the experimentation, the fun stuff, and so the client still gets more bang for their buck.<br />
Which (hopefully!) leads to even more word-of-mouth recommendations!<br />
I started with composition and will probably end my career there, for that&#8217;s where my true passion lies, but I would never have got there had I not diversified and got as much mileage out of the associated skills as I have.<br />
And I certainly wouldn&#8217;t have had as much fun along the way. Variety is, after all, the spice of life.<br />
Sometimes it&#8217;s good to be a one-man-band.</p>

<p>Now, I want to shift our focus from the 60&#8242;s to the 70&#8242;s and 80&#8242;s. This interview is priceless, and if you are looking to learn from someone who has done more television than anyone else on the planet, look no further than the great <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006236/">Mike Post</a>.</p>
<p>LA Law, The Rockford Files, The A-Team, Hill Street Blues, Magnum PI, Hunter, Quantum Leap, Doogie Howser MD, NYPD Blue, Law and Order&#8230; I mean, you tell me another guy who has had the success of Mike Post.</p>
<p>This is a 6-part oral history of Post&#8217;s career. Do yourself a favor: Take two hours today or tonight and write down everything you can from this interview. This should really be a film music school class all by itself. Pay particular attention to Parts 3 and 4 of this interview to *really* hear how scoring for TV works on the professional level.</p>

From January through March of 1987, TV Land did something that really changed me as a human (Yes, I&#8217;m that impressionable&#8230; or at least I was back then).

From January through March of 1987, TV Land did something that really changed me as a human (Yes, I&#8217;m <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> impressionable&#8230; or at least I was back then).</p>
<p>I was a latch-key kid and I relished my after-school freedom, which for those three short months, I had down to a pat ritual: School got out at 3pm, and the bus dropped me at the entrance to our cul-de-sac at about 3:45. If I put a box of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese on by 4:10, it would be ready by 4:30, which was when Nickelodeon&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">Lancelot Link: Secret Chimp</span> came on. During Lancelot&#8217;s third commercial break at 4:50, I could grab dessert in the form of a Klondike Bar (or two!), and be back on the couch and comfortable for the 5 o&#8217;clock reason for the whole routine to begin with&#8230; <span style="font-style: italic;">Planet of the Apes: The Series</span> on TV Land, with music by Lalo Schifrin.</p>
<p>Even though I had not seen anything from the POTA feature film franchise, and was not yet aware of Jerry Goldsmith&#8217;s music for the original, I was completely in love with Lalo Schifrin&#8217;s incredible use of percussion and 12-tone modes. Yes, it was all derivative of what JG cooked up in the first film, but I was hooked from day one of discovering <span style="font-style: italic;">TV Land&#8217;s </span>special short run of the show.</p>
<p>Lalo Schifrin has composed the scores for a vast catalog of landmark films and television programming, including the classics <span style="font-style: italic;">Enter the Dragon</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Bullitt</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Osterman Weekend</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Cincinnati Kid</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Cool Hand Luke</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Dirty Harry</span>, and the ever popular <span style="font-style: italic;">Rush Hour</span> franchise (not to mention my personal favorite, <span style="font-style: italic;">Charley Varrick</span>). But as deep as his scope of work is, it is still Schifrin&#8217;s theme for the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mission: Impossible</span> television show (and subsequent feature film franchise) that is undoubtedly his most famous work, and a piece of music that to this day frustrates music students trying to compose in 5/4 while avoiding Schifrin&#8217;s indelible &#8220;2 on 3&#8243; subdivision.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting thing to realize that you cannot, by good measure, write something in 5/4 and above 110 bpm without consciously trying to avoid the feel of Schifrin&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">MI</span> theme. When a composer is able to lend a voice to a film or show in such a great way as he did with that theme, whether by feel, tone, melody, or instrumentation, it is a remarkable thing. There are only a handful of composers who have been able to &#8220;lay claim&#8221;to a certain musical idea that ended up being almost bigger than the film it embodied. Those are the scores that, when heard independently of the films they accompany, transport you back to the exact moment when you first experienced that visual.</p>
<p>Additional examples of this phenomenal ability to transport a listener might include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jerry Goldsmith&#8217;s trumpet triplets from <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;Patton&#8221;</span></li>
<li>Ennio Morricone&#8217;s 2-note soprano flute melody for <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&#8221;</span></li>
<li>The marimbas of Thomas Newman&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;American Beauty</span>&#8221; score</li>
<li>Bernard Hermann&#8217;s shrieking shower scene violins in <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;Psycho&#8221;</span></li>
</ol>
<p>As a composer, it is a rare gift to be able to successfully give a film a musical identifier. It takes the right combination of placement and filmic understanding to achieve a proper balance and an exact fit. Many composers have attempted it with less than stellar results, while it seems that others don&#8217;t try real hard and it just comes naturally to them. The trend right now in our business is to &#8220;vibe&#8221; the style of a certain composer or a score of a certain composer. If I had a nickel for every demo CD I&#8217;ve heard that sounded like every other demo CD I&#8217;ve heard, I&#8217;d be a very rich man.</p>
<p>Which brings up today&#8217;s Composers&#8217; Confab question: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Can a composer be </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">truly</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> <span style="font-style: italic;">unprecedented</span> in today&#8217;s film music environment?</span> Are the days of absolute originality gone in film music? Was James Horner right when he suggested that all of the notes will be used eventually, thus self-plagiarism is inevitable? Are there any recognizable film music &#8220;pioneers&#8221; on the scene that might possibly one day ascend to the level of a &#8220;Morricone&#8221; or &#8220;Schifrin&#8221;? Do composers try so hard to distinguish themselves from the rest of the pack that they lose focus on the task at hand — writing the score?</p>
<p>Log into COMMENTS in the Footer and weigh in on the topic&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>By the way, the great Lalo Schifrin turns 77 today. SCOREcast wishes a very happy birthday to one of film music&#8217;s most cherished and treasured innovators of cinematic originality.</p></blockquote>

Most likely, the causes of these are the fact that there&#8217;s a lot of change going on in my life right now &#8211; I&#8217;m finishing up my current job, I&#8217;m going to see my girlfriend for the first time in 3 months soon, and a load of other things.   Anyway&#8230;.I digress.  I&#8217;ve been having some cool &#8220;music&#8221; dreams lately &#8211; I&#8217;m sure a lot of you can all relate.</p>
<p>One of my latest dreams that I can remember was being in a concert, and the orchestra was playing my music &#8211; in real-time as I composed it! In my dream, I understood the entire workings of the orchestra, and exactly how to compose great orchestral music.  It was like a revelation &#8211; a light bulb went on somewhere, and I suddenly understood it all.  Then I woke up&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious to see what kind of dreams you guys have &#8211; I&#8217;ve had everything from playing the most amazing music on a church organ, to going shopping for guitars, and trying to drag a Gibson SG out of my dream with my as I woke up.  So share your experiences! Let us know what kind of crazy musical dreams you&#8217;ve had!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Before diving headlong into an analytical frenzy surrounding the functions of film music, one must begin by establishing a frame of reference by which the very existence of film music centers. In doing that one must not immediately look at specific moments in film that are supported by music but rather moments which are not.</div>
<p>Silence (or non-scored scenes) in film is a beautiful thing. I have a knack for confusing people by saying that even as a film composer, there is nothing I love more than film that works perfectly without music. There&#8217;s an ingrained sense of cinematic perfection when it achieves its narrative goals without the aid of music. These moments contain something that music could never offer&#8230;complete and total silence (by that I&#8217;m still acknowledging the existence of dialogue and sound effects).</p>
<p>If we are to believe that music is an ingredient that when added to a particular scene helps achieve a variety of narrative goals then one might reasonably deduce that perhaps that scene is flawed in some way. Is this true? If the scene needs help by employing music does that make it an inferior scene to one that is successful wholly on its own?</p>
<p>These are rhetorical questions that don&#8217;t necessarily need answering. Because of the extreme variation in cinematic storytelling and the many obstacles contained therein there is no definitive answer. However, I pose the question merely to get your brain tuned to the frequency of judging silence vs. scoring. I think the art of spotting a film (deciding where music should go in a movie) is dying. Gone are the days where I&#8217;m noticing clever choices in spotting which used to be frequently exhibited by composers like Bernard Herrmann, Miklós Rózsa, and perhaps the best spotter of them all&#8230;Jerry Goldsmith. Their creative decisions on where to put music (or more importantly, where <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> to put music) vastly effected the overall success and quality of their scores and ultimately their respective films.</p>
<p>For example, let&#8217;s look at a classic scene in NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959) directed by Alfred Hitchcock. There is a moment where Roger Thornhill (played by Cary Grant) ascends upon a lone crossroads in the middle of nowhere to await instruction from his unknown mystery source. He stands there patiently&#8230;waiting. The scene is unusually long and not much, if anything, really happens. A car drives by, a man appears and waits, a bus passes&#8230;all benign, boring, and without a clue of justification.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1267" title="north_by_northwest" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/north_by_northwest-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" /></p>
<p>So how does the master, Bernard Herrmann, decide to score benign and boring? He doesn&#8217;t. The scene, in its entirety, is left completely unscored. Why? Isn&#8217;t Herrmann worried about losing at least part of the audience here? It&#8217;s a valid concern.</p>
<p>This entire scene is about perpetuating one question&#8230;<span style="font-style: italic;">What the hell is going on?</span> Roger is internally asking it to himself. We, as the audience, are asking this of ourselves as we experience this along with him. It&#8217;s the &#8220;elephant-in-the-room&#8221; of this scene. There isn&#8217;t a note of music Herrmann could have written that could better express the awkwardness of the moment better than silence. It&#8217;s the inherent function of silence that works so utterly beautifully here. Moments later the scene is thrust into overdrive as Roger is peculiarly attacked by a nearby crop-dusting biplane. Again the question accelerates and perpetuates&#8230;&#8221;What the hell is going on?&#8221; It isn&#8217;t until the scene is completely over and the crop duster plows into the side of a tanker truck that Herrmann finally enters the music.</p>
<p>As many times as I&#8217;ve seen this scene, I often wonder if it were made today how many composers would automatically score this scene. I think a high percentage of them probably would. It&#8217;s a powerful lesson more composers should heed.</p>
<p>Silence is a powerful thing&#8230;and as an added benefit, it&#8217;s far less work.</p>

At the other end of the spectrum, a lot of music is still created the good old-fashioned way &#8212; by flesh-and-blood musicians who play our scores.  In the middle, all sorts of hybrids are possible.</p>
<p>It would be of great interest (well, to me, at least) to know more about the <span style="font-style: italic;">actual </span>proportion of music which, in its <span style="font-style: italic;">final </span>form (e.g., in a film soundtrack) is currently being played by &#8220;virtual musicians&#8221; vs. real musicians.</p>
<p>Another facet of this issue:  Is the public&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">expectation </span>for media score shifting in the direction of virtual music?  If so, are we eroding an appreciation for the incredible accomplishments of many great composers (think Wagner, Stravinsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Copland, Holmboe, and on and on) who, without a computer, effects rack, or whatever, created music that could readily be fantastic score even in today&#8217;s films?  Does it matter?</p>
<p>Is constant pressure to produce on short schedules forcing increased use of virtual music technology?  Does this approach actually save time (or money)?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to suggest that using technology to produce music isn&#8217;t a true art in and of itself.  I&#8217;ve long been a virtual music proponent, but traditional practice is becoming of increasing interest to me.</p>
<p>Please share your impressions and actual experience.  I&#8217;d bet a <span style="font-style: italic;">lot</span> of us have something to say on this topic &#8211; and it affects how we approach our craft, as well.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a creativity tool, and I&#8217;ve found it to be powerful and simple. I use it all the time in my own career. So what I&#8217;m going to do here at SCOREcast is this: each week I&#8217;ll post one of these provocations, and then we&#8217;ll all mull it over in the comments.</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">This one&#8217;s just plain crazy, and that&#8217;s why I like it as an opener. Film music has been around nearly as long as the art form has existed, and we continue to rely on and refine it as a narrative tool. It&#8217;s an art form, and calling for its abolishment is insane—besides all of which, if films didn&#8217;t have scores, this fine website you&#8217;re reading right now wouldn&#8217;t have much of a reason for being. :-)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">On the other hand: thinking of this statement as a provocation leads us to consider just what it is that a film score is trying to accomplish, the role of silence in film music (which leads to thinking we might not otherwise do about our own compositional process and the use of <span style="font-style: italic;">space</span> in that process), and all kinds of other possibilities… which I hope you&#8217;ll join us in discussing in the comments.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Look for one of these <span style="font-weight: bold;">Weekend Provocations</span> each Friday.</span></span></p>

<p>So, I saw the new Star Trek this last week with my wife. While I won&#8217;t comment on the film or the score until I know most of you have had the chance to see it for yourself, I will say (and this won&#8217;t spoil anything for anyone, so chill out!) the best part for me was the Star Trek theme that Michael Giacchino rearranged over the end credit crawl. That brilliant theme was written by legendary composer Alexander &#8220;Sandy&#8221; Courage, who also wrote the famous Star Trek series fanfare, the first two pilot episodes, and subsequently many more episodes of that incredible television series.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is the secret to success as a film composer? We all talk about networking, internet promotion, social networks, building your image, people skills, getting press, websites, gear, DAWs, sample libraries—all of these are important, but dependent on one thing: the quality and uniqueness of your work. If your music is mediocre, if it sounds like every other bloke out there with a drive full of VSTs, then all of your marketing efforts won’t matter much.</p>
<p>As you know, for better and for worse, the barrier to entry into film scoring has been lowered. With a few pieces of software you now have all the tools to create a complete film score. The downside is that people no longer need to know how to read or write music, be proficient at their instrument, or have a true knowledge of orchestration. Is that bad? Not in itself, but the result is that the film score landscape has become so homogeneous that an agent recently told me producers can now identify <em>Storm Drum</em> just by hearing it on the demos they are sent!</p>
<p>That’s potentially good for you. This means you have a chance to separate yourself by working harder at your craft and being unique. Don’t just rehash what others have done, it’s not a good career move. Being unique takes hard work and is not an accident. But how do you know if you are good? Can you judge for yourself? To answer this question, I present to you &#8230;drum roll please&#8230; the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" target="_blank">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>, a report that states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>“&#8230;an unskilled person makes poor decisions and reaches erroneous conclusions, but their incompetence denies them the meta-cognitive ability to realize their mistakes. The unskilled therefore suffer from illusory superiority, rating their own ability as above average, much higher than it actually is, while the highly skilled underrate their abilities, suffering from illusory inferiority. This leads to the situation in which less competent people rate their own ability higher than more competent people.”</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But someone who is in this position can be made to “recognize and acknowledge their own previous lack of skill, if they can be trained to substantially improve.”</p>
<p>In other words: If you think you are great, then you probably aren’t and don’t even have the tools to recognize excellence. If you are plagued with self-doubt, then you are probably doing okay.</p>
<p>I am sure that this brings to mind at least one person to each of you, or perhaps more!</p>
<p>The irony, though, is that the person who suffers from the Dunning-Kruger effect is blissfully unaware of his own shortcomings. So who’s to say it’s not <em>you</em> who is clueless? Based on this study, there is only one solution, one that I completely agree with: <em>reach a high level of musical study</em>. (And no, elementary harmony and voice-leading does not count!) A high level of music study will give you the tools to recognize and reach excellence, to have music that stands above the sea of DAW-Warriors. As a result your music will stand apart. Producers and directors will notice you—the quality of your work will make you an asset to them and they will proudly recommend you to others, because in this business, recommendations and word of mouth are the most potent marketing tools.</p>
<p>Do you think you suffer from the Dunning-Kruger effect?</p>
