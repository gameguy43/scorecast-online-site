		<description><![CDATA[Contemplating moving to Los Angeles for a career in film music? Here are composer Mark Smythe's observations...]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been in Los Angeles since early March 2013 on an Australia Council-funded mentorship program, absorbing all things film music and SoCal: The Good, The Bad and The Bellicose. These are my reflections so far.</p>
<h2>Transit Tantrums</h2>
<p>LA traffic on Thursday afternoon is slower than a George R. R. Martin novel&#8230;and in my case on a shuttle ride, just as gob-smacking when something finally happened. Two young girls in front were chatting excitedly about their impending adventure. Now, they weren&#8217;t exactly shrill but the conversation was audible to all. 40 minutes in, a baby-boomer businessman had an explosive outburst: &#8220;We DON&#8217;T CARE about your banal existence!&#8221;&#8230;stunned silence. A whimpered response. Simmering tension until they were dropped off&#8230;at the same hotel as Mr Explosion and his embarrassed wife. Welcome to Hollywood, girls!</p>
<p>I went to <a href="http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/bmi_participates_in_first_southeast_film_music_symposium" target="_blank">Chattanooga</a> for a weekend, as you do. I had a dawn flight out of LAX so stayed at an airport hotel the night before. Passed the concierge as a man was SCREAMING HIS HEAD OFF at a cab driver for apparently ripping him off all of $9. He kept threatening to call the cops but finally backed down.</p>
<p>On LAX-CHA flight 1, the overhead lockers filled up and a bunch of people had to check their bags through to final destinations, including myself. I didn&#8217;t care; all I needed was my iPad and headphones. Others <em>did care</em> &#8211; airline staff were hammered by well-heeled women with an inflated sense of entitlement, indignant that they wouldn&#8217;t have access to their L&#8217;Oreal travel kits and Xanax.</p>
<p>Then there was the 4-hour delay in Charlotte due to the incoming plane having &#8216;mechanical issues&#8217;. Initially it was 1 hour, then 2&#8230;etc. Was it annoying? Yes. Did it warrant the ageing rocker with a gig that night having an absolute meltdown at the check-in girl, to the point that once again the police were mentioned? NO. I wasn&#8217;t overly happy myself, but would much rather be delayed than fall out of the sky. And for a while there it did feel like the precursor to an episode of &#8216;Air Crash Investigations&#8217;.</p>
<p>SO &#8211; my point is, this was very early into my visit and I was thinking &#8216;holy crap, is this REALLY what Americans are like?&#8217; NO IT ISN&#8217;T. The symposium was FANTASTIC and when I returned to LA, the perpetually warm glow of Angelenos restored my societal faith. I guess travel brings out the best/worst in anyone and I saw some doozies of the latter kind. 99.9% of Americans are nice, genuinely interested in foreigners and usually mean it when they say &#8220;what can I do to help?&#8221;. Embrace that percentile.</p>
<h2>Location/Vehiculation</h2>
<p>Something anyone new to to town should consider carefully, well before landing. Unlike Melbourne, where I could walk 5 minutes to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Fawkner Park or my local cafe strip, LA isn&#8217;t <em>really</em> a city. Rather, it&#8217;s a vast sprawl of mini-cities connected by a web of freeways, each enclave having a unique flavour that may or may not suit your taste. Santa Monica and Venice are renowned for their beach lifestyle and slightly cooler air, but if most of your stuff&#8217;s happening Downtown or in The Valley, you&#8217;ll spend an awful lot of time on the road if you&#8217;re based out west. I knew I&#8217;d be hanging in Studio City/ Hollywood a lot, so took the time to find and pre-book the perfect AirBNB rental, smack in the middle. Slightly pricey but the location definitely saved me time and money. If AirBNB-style pads are beyond your budget, the ubiquitous CRAIGSLIST is a great place to find sub-lets, especially during summer holidays.</p>
<p>Mode of transport is a no-brainer. Unless you have incredibly helpful friends going to Point B (which I actually often do) or don&#8217;t mind spending hours traversing multi Metro routes, <em><strong>you need a car</strong></em>. If you have no choice but to get a cab somewhere, KNOW THIS: They&#8217;ll take at least 20 minutes to turn up, cost a lot and woe betide the passenger that dares to pay by credit card – even if your cab-finder app says it&#8217;s cool. I had a heated argument with a driver about this very point; in the end he was only placated when I tipped cash. If you don&#8217;t want to drive on a night out, a far better option is <a href="http://www.lyft.me" target="_blank">LYFT</a>: a smartphone app that uses your location to find and order a driver in minutes, is 20% cheaper, 100% friendlier and automatically calculates a tip-inclusive fare – ONLY from your credit card. Ok, so they have weird pink moustaches on the cars, but most drivers also stock water and snack treats : )</p>
<h2>LA Flakers — A Few Bad Players or a Team Malaise?</h2>
<p>Much has been said and written about the notoriously slow/complete lack of follow through here in Tinseltown; one friend even suggested that &#8216;yes means maybe, maybe means no and people never say no&#8217;. Hackneyed phrases are quoted with mirth by the cheerfully cynical: “let&#8217;s do lunch” &#8211; ”we&#8217;ll talk” &#8211; etc. Well. I made a conscious decision to ignore the cliché and decide for myself what the deal is. Consequently, I&#8217;ve been very surprised by the reality:</p>
<h3>Those Who&#8217;ve Flaked:</h3>
<p>&#8211; Old Aussie friends now based here, who wanted things from me on a social/industry/material level (they got 2 of the 3) but gave nothing back. Even after I said “You&#8217;re not going to flake on me are you, we will catch up?” I tried to follow up. Twice. We never caught up, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if I suddenly hear from them just before their next gig.<br />
&#8211; Potential new LA friends via Bookface; they were going to &#8216;reach out&#8217; one weekend&#8230;back in March. I tried to follow up. Twice. They de-friended me. Maybe my dry humour was misconstrued when I sent a link to that Four Tops track.</p>
<h3>Those Who Haven&#8217;t Flaked:</h3>
<p>&#8211; New composer friends, including very busy ones working on high-rating shows.<br />
&#8211; Everyone in the industry I&#8217;ve emailed/left a message for, including those I don&#8217;t know that well or haven&#8217;t met yet. I did wait 3 weeks for one reply, but this was a new contact and I time-budgeted accordingly.</p>
<p>So – I&#8217;ve been mildly affected by flakelenos at social level, but industry/music folks have treated me with more than a modicum of politeness and respect. Maybe because I haven&#8217;t burdened myself with unrealistic expectations or exuded the desperate &#8216;I want something from you&#8217; vibe that you can smell a mile away from so many young aspirants. If you come here thinking you&#8217;ll reach the summit straight away, THAT is flakey. Ed Hilary completed his first major climb 13 YEARS before scaling Everest. Patience, persistence and prudence, my friends&#8230;</p>
<h2>Event Etiquette</h2>
<p>Outside of my mentorship with <a href="http://jeffcardoni.com" target="_blank">Jeff Cardoni</a> (CSI:Miami, Wilfred) I&#8217;ve attended a swag (Australian vernacular) of workshops, screenings, seminars and masterclasses. Each event has featured high calibre composers, orchestrators, conductors, directors, or moderators and has been well conceived. Sadly, I can&#8217;t say the same for some of the <em>questions</em> that inevitably slip through the relevance cordon at these things. IT&#8217;S NOT ABOUT YOU! Do you really think that standing up so that everyone can see you when you say &#8220;Hi, my name&#8217;s [wannabe composer X] and I&#8217;ve been working on/done a lot of [gratuitous promo Y] and I work in [DAW Z],&#8221; will make them think <em>&#8220;Wow, I&#8217;m really interested in this guy and what he does, he must write like me because he uses DAW Z&#8221;</em>&#8230;? Truth is, by the time you&#8217;ve got to the actual question, half the room has tuned out (or in my case, head in hands) and the A-lister will remember your face for all the wrong reasons when you push your way through the post-event throng. Then there are those that ask questions just to be &#8216;involved&#8217; and &#8216;seen&#8217;, even if they&#8217;re &#8220;just a songwriter&#8221;&#8230;and you seriously want to punch them when they ask Thomas Newman if he &#8220;scores to picture&#8221;. Or the guy that asked Aaron Zigman if he &#8220;hums ideas in the shower&#8221;. Come on people! Be enthusiastic, but don&#8217;t be a wanker.</p>
<h2>Weeding Out the Tall Poppy</h2>
<p>Australians and New Zealanders are not known for overt self-promotion. In fact, those that say &#8220;I&#8217;m a big deal&#8221; are more often than not regarded as wankers and ostracised by their peers. This is the <strong><em>Tall Poppy Syndrome</em></strong> at work – a &#8216;cut them down&#8217; attitude towards high achievers that is uniquely endemic to Australasia. When I was younger and just out of film music school, I was brimming with enthusiasm; thrilled with any work I could get and any composer I met. Said enthusiasm combined with the mild hero-worship of a composer I spent time with somehow lead to me being perceived as a &#8216;name-dropper&#8217; by a high-ranking person in the Australian film music world. Fast forward four years to the Australian Screen Music Awards, which I was invited to by the organisation this person works for. At an industry lunch prior to the ceremony I made a concerted effort to have a pleasant conversation with this person. But when I told her I was looking forward to the awards, she asked “Are you attending legitimately?”</p>
<p>Happily, my experiences in LA have been the complete opposite. Here, it&#8217;s okay to talk about what you&#8217;ve done, what you&#8217;re doing, who you&#8217;ve connected with and what your aims are. I&#8217;ve been doing so with complete openness and honesty over the last 3 months and have been treated with more respect than I ever was in Australia. In fact, one delightful Executive Director (who holds a comparable position to my antipodean nemesis) now refers to me as her &#8216;favourite Kiwi&#8217;. And you know what? I can write about my awesome night at <a href="http://www.jeffbeal.com" target="_blank">Jeff Beal</a>&#8216;s place without fear of someone telling everybody I&#8217;ve been blowing my own trumpet. I can mention the <a href="http://www.hmmawards.org" target="_blank">Hollywood Music in Media Awards</a> competition I won &#8211; a scoring session with Mr. Beal; helping him record a 25-piece string orchestra. I can say that we exchanged CDs and that he particularly likes my choral stuff.</p>
<p>Los Angeles certainly takes some getting used to, but it&#8217;s so worth it. The top film music people I&#8217;ve met genuinely embrace talent, passion and commitment when they see it.</p>
<p>This, above all, makes me want to stick around.</p>
