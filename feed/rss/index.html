		<title>Black Friday: Your Workweek In Question</title>
		<description><![CDATA[For at least one country on the planet, yesterday was a day of giving thanks, loads of food, celebration, and time with loved ones. For many others, it was a day not unlike all the rest... cues, cues, cues, cues, and more cues. During this time of year, as Hollywood is prepping for its customary December 15-January 10 shutdown, many composers are hard at work in their studios, cranking out the year's last few notes... so that they can at least have a taste of the turkey on December 25th. What about you?]]></description>

		<title>To Be Busy or To Not Be Busy</title>

Ultimately, you want to create demand for yourself and your music, and perhaps the simple act of being a busy composer, regardless of what you are busy with... will do that for you. Or will it?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nothing will give your music heart, soul, the real human touch, better than the sounds of skilled musicians. Even if you yourself are the finest, with years of experience, even adding just one pro player will double your firepower, and even casual listeners will notice. So, now that you are off the phone and someone is on his or her way, it's time to think about just how to interact for the best possible results. This is where you will be called on to put on your "producer" hat. Let's talk about what that entails...]]></description>

		<title>What Is Your Greatest Motivator?</title>
		<description><![CDATA["Motivation" is a strange thing. Be careful how you answer this one: We are certainly aware of the risk involved in even putting this question out there—we are inviting a deluge of the token "writing music is who I am" comments. Honestly, though, if you lost everyone and everything in your life tomorrow, we'd bet money that the least important "treasure" would be all of the shows you've worked on.

With that in perspective.... What is your greatest motivator?]]></description>

		<title>Deane Ogden: Budgets: Putting Your Money Where Your Mock-Up Is</title>
		<description><![CDATA["How much money will I make as a film composer?" That's the six million dollar question, isn't it? As much as we can try to come up with a complete answer, the only true answer really is, "Whatever you can!" The bigger question—and the one I want to tackle here—is "How much money do live players eat up during a film score's production and how do you plan for the bloodshed?" The answer to that questions is... "I wish there was an answer."

Now that I've been no help at all, let's see if we can figure it out together...]]></description>

		<title>Heather Fenoughty: 51 Marketing Ideas for Film Music Composers</title>
		<description><![CDATA[For some reason, we creative types seem to take an instant dislike to the notion of Branding and Marketing.

We can't be quantified or packaged. We're artists, darling. Our art speaks for itself. All true... but all the art out there is vying equally for all of your potential clients' attentions. And those attention spans are short and very demanding. If you want to make your art into a business, i.e. make money at it, you've no choice - you have to brand yourself and then market your art. No getting away from it.
