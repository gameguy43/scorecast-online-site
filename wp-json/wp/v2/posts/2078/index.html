That&#8217;s right.\u00a0After already spending half a million on pre-production just weeks away from\u00a0shooting, James Franco pulled out of\u00a0GARDEN OF LAST DAYS,\u00a0a film he was directing and starring in.\u00a0The reason?\u00a0According to Mike Flemming at <em>Deadline Hollywood:<\/em><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Franco\u2019s exit had to do with a disagreement with financier Millennium over the crew he wanted to hire. Basically, Franco put together a crew that didn\u2019t &#8220;have the experience&#8221; to get approval from the bond company. Millennium wouldn\u2019t approve his choices.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p>There are a couple different ways to interpret what happened. I realize we are armchair quarterbacking this and not privy to exactly what happened. But think about it with me for a moment. One possible scenario is that Millennium just did not want to do the project any more out of their fear it would lose money and they quietly, under the table, told the bond company to not approve the crew. This would allow them to save the relationship with their star Franco and blame the film not happening on the faceless bond company. That is a possibility. Also&#8230;I am told the bond company does not really care if the film is good&#8230;just if the film can be done on the budget laid out. It is possible the $3M budgeted was certain to go way over budget and the crew assembled did not have the experience to navigate a tight budget. They most likely met with everyone they would have been concerned about&#8230; and discovered the way they are wanting to shoot, there would be no way they were going to only spend $3M. The bond company estimation could have been much higher to finish the film Franco wanted to make and so determined his crew didn&#8217;t know how to be efficient with their choices. That is also possible for sure. But part of me thinks something else may be going on.<\/p>\n<p>James Franco is a rather talented guy who has shown his talent both in front of and behind the camera. He also is someone in this industry who I would consider to be a true &#8220;artist&#8221;.\u00a0I have always felt he is creating art when he works.\u00a0He takes chances.\u00a0He works on both indies and Blockbusters.\u00a0He breaks barriers.\u00a0And he has also finally earned the respect of many in Hollywood as an &#8220;A-list&#8221; actor.\u00a0There is little doubt he knows what he is doing when it comes to making a successful film.\u00a0So why would a studio\/bond company trust him enough to hire him as a director, but not trust his choices for his crew?<\/p>\n<p>I was speaking with a director\/producer friend of mine. \u00a0He is an active AMPAS member, respected by his peers, and use to be a studio executive in addition to his producing work.\u00a0So he has been on both sides of the process of making and releasing a film. He knows what he is talking about. He shared with me a profound concept that explains how to interpret what is going on in Hollywood here. And he learned it from\u00a0Hal Prince,\u00a0an American theatrical producer and director who has worked on many of the best-known Broadway musical productions of the past 50 years. Hal has garnered twenty-one Tony Awards, more than any other individual, including eight for directing, eight for producing the year&#8217;s Best Musical, two as Best Producer of a Musical and three special awards.\u00a0Cabaret, West Side Story, Cats, Evite, Phantom Of The Opera.\u00a0The list goes on and on.<\/p>\n<p>Hal said there is a difference between a &#8220;Hit&#8221; &amp; a &#8220;Flop&#8221; and a &#8220;Success&#8221; &amp; a &#8220;Failure.&#8221;\u00a0One set of terms has to do with money&#8230;the other does not.<\/p>\n<p>A\u00a0<em><strong>hit<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0makes money.\u00a0Lots of money.<br \/>\nA\u00a0<em><strong>flop<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0does not.<\/p>\n<p>A\u00a0<em><strong>success<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0is not tied to money but whether if it is successful in what it set out to do.\u00a0(Tell a compelling story, entertain, etc&#8230;)<br \/>\nA\u00a0<em><strong>failure<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0is unsuccessful in completing its goals.<\/p>\n<p>How does this apply to Hollywood today?\u00a0Many might argue that Hollywood is more concerned these days about having &#8220;hit films&#8221; than it is about creating film successes.\u00a0A hit does not necessarily have to be a successful film.\u00a0In fact, I would argue many hits today are not very successful films.\u00a0How many times have you gone to see the latest blockbuster film and left the theater saying to yourself, &#8220;that was just not a good film.&#8221;\u00a0And yet it made millions at the box office opening weekend.\u00a0It was a hit.\u00a0But as a film&#8230;it was a failure.\u00a0Disney&#8217;s\u00a0<em>John Carter<\/em>\u00a0is a recent example many considered to be in the flop category.\u00a0They did take a $200M write down on the film after all and Rich Ross resigned from his position at Disney over it.<\/p>\n<p>On the contrary, there are many\u00a0films that were extremely successful, but flops at the box office.\u00a0Going back a bit into the 90&#8217;s, <em>Pleasantville<\/em>\u00a0completely changed how the industry worked in Post-Production. A\u00a0change still in effect today. \u00a0It was the first film to use a Digital Intermediate throughout the entire Post process for its groundbreaking color effects.\u00a0Previous to this, the digital intermediate was used sparingly for FX shots only.\u00a0Most people I know love the film and all of those associated with the film are very well-respected in Hollywood for their work on that film.\u00a0It was truly a success in everything it set out to do and changed Hollywood for the better.\u00a0But financially at the box office it was actually a flop.<\/p>\n<h2>A New Paradigm<\/h2>\n<p>We have to recognize that the financiers and studios today are much more interested in hits than successes. Despite his proven track record of success in film, Franco still could not get his chosen crew to get approved on this little $3 million dollar indie film.\u00a0This is not hundreds of millions of dollars we are talking about here, but a very low budgeted $3M indie.\u00a0And Millennium Films, according Deadline Hollywood, would apparently not approve his flop of a crew.\u00a0Reading between the lines, I keep coming back to the thought that just because some on the crew had not made a $100M dollar hit film, does that necessarily mean they don&#8217;t know what they are doing on a $3M indie film?\u00a0No.\u00a0It doesn&#8217;t.\u00a0The next Tariq Anwar (Editor &#8211; <em>The King&#8217;s Speech, American Beauty<\/em>), Freddie Young (Cinematographer &#8211; <em>Lawrence Of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago<\/em>) or Jerry Goldsmith could be among that young crew.<\/p>\n<p>I continue to speculate here, but does anyone really think James Franco would be putting a crew together for a film he was reportedly passionate about that could not pull off what he wanted to do with this little indie?\u00a0I don&#8217;t.\u00a0I think the true artist in James was putting together the exact crew perfect to make THAT film&#8230;and yet because some of them were not on the Millennium short list of dept. heads in town, the financiers and bond company (who are experts at the numbers game and not artists and filmmakers) got nervous and began to butt heads with Franco.\u00a0They did not trust him and his directing choices and probably lost interest in the project and were concerned it would be a flop. \u00a0Whether Millennium put the bond company up to not approving the project or not, we will never know. But\u00a0Franco, out of true loyalty to his film&#8217;s vision and his chosen crew that he believed in, simply walked away.\u00a0Proving to those around him that there is more to this business than making a hit.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong: The hits <em>are<\/em> important.\u00a0They help the studio&#8217;s fund other productions.\u00a0They <em>must<\/em> have hits. But if Hollywood is going to start making successful original films again, the films that will become iconic and remembered for generations to come, it is going to have to stop putting a &#8220;hit requirement&#8221; on everything it produces and take more chances across the board on both original stories and young, talented people.\u00a0Especially the $3M indies like Franco&#8217;s GARDEN OF LAST DAYS and other &#8220;entry-level films&#8221; that are the proving grounds for the future generation of filmmakers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;But&#8230;as composers..how does this apply to us,&#8221; you ask?\u00a0Well, if you have never had a &#8220;hit&#8221; film&#8230;that does not mean you are not a successful composer.\u00a0It does not mean you don&#8217;t know what you are doing or talking about.\u00a0It means the folks out there that may be saying that are confused about the difference between a hit &amp; a flop and a success &amp; a failure. They are not the same.\u00a0They are exclusive of one another.\u00a0As a composer, you need to simply focus on making every film score you work on a success and stop worrying about whether it is attached to a hit.\u00a0Does your music make the film better? Does it do its job well? Did you write a successful score? That is what you should be focusing on.<\/p>\n<p>Hal Prince\u00a0had\u00a0it right.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Deadline Hollywood \u2014\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.deadline.com\/2013\/06\/garden-of-last-days-scrapped-as-directorstar-james-franco-exits-two-weeks-before-shooting\/\" target=\"_blank\">James Franco Exits Two Weeks Before Shooting<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many might argue that Hollywood is more concerned these days about having &#8220;hit films&#8221; than it is about creating successful ones.
