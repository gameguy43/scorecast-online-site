I want to know how I can create various timbres, textures, and effects \u2013 that communicate emotions and moods \u2013 using combinations of instruments and playing techniques. By studying scores, listening to performances, and emulating, I aim to unlock the secrets of great composers who, either long ago or recently, have written music that moves my soul. At the same time, I&#8217;m striving to perfect the methods I use to mock up complete orchestras and scores, using my <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Digital audio workstation\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Digital_audio_workstation\" rel=\"wikipedia\">DAW<\/a>, studio gear, and collection of virtual instruments. These methods are an important part of my overall <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">composing workflow<\/span> \u2013 this month\u2019s theme.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">An Alternative to Samples<\/span><br \/>\n[<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">In the following discussion, I assume you have some familiarity with DAWs, virtual instrument (VI) plugins, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Musical Instrument Digital Interface\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Musical_Instrument_Digital_Interface\" rel=\"wikipedia\">MIDI<\/a>, and the use of sample libraries.<\/span>]<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ve heard it\u2019s important to make your MIDI mockups as realistic as you can. Perhaps, when you hear <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">realistic<\/span>, you think <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sample libraries<\/span>. What VI could sound more realistic than one based on recordings of an actual acoustic instrument?<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a good thought, but <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Sampling (music)\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sampling_%28music%29\" rel=\"wikipedia\">sampling<\/a> technology has its limitations. In this article, I discuss some of these disadvantages and explore an alternative technology, based on a form of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Additive synthesis\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Additive_synthesis\" rel=\"wikipedia\">additive synthesis<\/a><\/span>, that might better suit some of your needs. Sample-based VIs play back instrument waveforms that were previously captured verbatim and stored in a library. In contrast, additive synthesis is a particular way of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">mathematically modeling<\/span> the acoustic waves produced by a real instrument and the instrument-dependent manner in which these waves change in response to input (e.g., breath, bowing, fingering, etc.). When you need to hear the instrument\u2019s sound, the model is used to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">compute <\/span>a waveform on the fly. This waveform doesn\u2019t purport to be identical to the waveform the real instrument would have produced, but does aim to be perceptually very similar.<\/p>\n<p>An effective variant of this modeling technique is the basis of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Wallander Interactive Virtual Instrument<\/span> (WIVI) family, offered by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wallanderinstruments.com\/\">Wallander Instruments<\/a>. Existing WIVIs are explicitly oriented toward those composing for traditional instruments (though you can invent non-traditional ones). The combination of features offered by WIVIs is certainly intriguing, if not unique in the current marketplace. Instrument rendition is better than skeptical sampling addicts might expect, and in my own case, is often closer to my expectations than what I get from my samples. If I don\u2019t like what I\u2019m hearing, I can probably improve it, because WIVI sound is highly malleable. If you\u2019ve ever tried tweaking MIDI mockups to sound more realistic, you know how important this can be, but may have noted that sampling technology offers limited adjustability at a detailed level. Most striking is that when you combine multiple WIVIs into orchestral ensembles, the result doesn\u2019t sound \u201cphasey\u201d, organ-like, or otherwise unnatural, but rather convincingly realistic. Wallander attributes this to slight randomization of several attributes of each instrument\u2019s sound, calling this feature <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">performance randomization<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m actually using brass and woodwind WIVIs, in addition to sampling and several other technologies, in my studio right now. If you\u2019re trying to decide how to spend your precious dollars and time, learning about WIVIs might aid your decision process.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Computational Issues, and System Cost<\/span><br \/>\nLet\u2019s compare WIVIs with sampling-based VIs, beginning with computing requirements. Typical sample libraries contain many gigabytes of sample data. Most sample data must be read from disk, in real time, at the moment it\u2019s needed. If you\u2019re running many sample-based VIs (i.e., to mock up a full orchestra), you need one or more big, fast disks dedicated to your sample libraries. You likely need more than 4 Gbytes of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Random-access memory\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Random-access_memory\" rel=\"wikipedia\">RAM<\/a> to buffer your sample data, and since a 32-bit <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Central processing unit\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Central_processing_unit\" rel=\"wikipedia\">CPU<\/a> can address a maximum of 4 Gbytes, you probably need a 64-bit CPU and OS. Your computer needs a fast, wide datapath to move huge amounts of data from disk to RAM quickly enough. These requirements mean increased system expense and probable support headaches. But WIVIs, unlike sample-based instruments, don\u2019t move massive amounts of data from disk to RAM. They\u2019re able to run on much more modest computers, even many laptops.<\/p>\n<p>Sample-based VI plugins pre-load considerable sample data into RAM when they\u2019re initialized. You see this when start up your DAW \u2013 if you load a project with a large number of sampled VI plugins, you may have to wait up to several minutes before all plugins are ready and you can start working. This doesn\u2019t happen with WIVIs, since they pre-load relatively little data. You get near-instant gratification.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut,\u201d you say, \u201cI\u2019ve already invested in a big machine to run samples, and I just go for coffee when starting up my DAW. So why should <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">I<\/span> care?\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Achieving Realism<\/span><br \/>\nI\u2019ve already explained that the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">performance randomization<\/span> feature of each WIVI is crucial to the illusion of realism when WIVIs are combined into ensembles. This is not only a matter of mimicking the imperfections of human players, but also counteracts adverse sonic effects that occur when combining sounds are too highly correlated, effects you <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">don\u2019t<\/span> hear when listening to real ensembles. WIVI-style randomization may be the most important single factor in the ability of WIVIs to achieve realistic orchestral sound.<\/p>\n<p>But there\u2019s much more. Consider any wind instrument, for example. With the real wind instrument, you know that when you blow harder, the sound gets louder but <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">also <\/span>changes in timbre. When playing expressively, it\u2019s second nature for a musician to vary his or her instrument\u2019s sound \u2013 in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">both <\/span>amplitude and timbre \u2013 within single notes, as well as from note to note. Because WIVIs are based on a model that permits both amplitude and timbre to be varied at <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">any <\/span>time, in response to breath pressure, they can reproduce this behavior and thereby lend themselves to achieving more natural-sounding playing. Sample-based VIs don\u2019t have this capability \u2013 you\u2019re able to vary amplitude within a note (e.g., by varying CC11), but timbre doesn\u2019t vary naturally along with it. Likewise, whereas a WIVI models the way a real wind instrument\u2019s pitch varies as a function of breath pressure, sample-based VIs cannot do so. Vibrato? WIVIs let you add that, as well, with continuous control over several pertinent parameters. Breath noise, key noise, attack, release, and those all-important <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">note transitions<\/span>? Just about anything you\u2019d like to be able to vary (or not vary), you can.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Whence Articulations?<\/span><br \/>\nYou\u2019re probably used to seeing sample libraries that offer many different \u201carticulations\u201d for a given instrument. That\u2019s a big part of how they attempt to facilitate realism. WIVIs aren\u2019t set up that way, because with their inherent control capabilities you can <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">create <\/span>just about any articulation you need. In contrast, if a sample library doesn\u2019t have the articulation you need, or the variant provided doesn\u2019t sound right, you\u2019re stuck. Trills are a good example. A typical sample library provides canned, half- and whole-step trills. But you know trills can be played in different ways to enhance expression \u2013 imagine wanting to imitate the uneven fluttering of a butterfly. WIVIs let you design your own trills, and each one can be unique if you\u2019d like. Same for any other articulation.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you want to speed your workflow, a WIVI lets you create your own library of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">re-usable<\/span> articulations, using what are called <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Smart Sequences<\/span>. You can then set up a keyswitch to call up any articulation at any time, just as you can with many sample libraries. Taking advantage of this and other WIVI flexibilities requires work and skill \u2013 but the point is: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">you can do it<\/span>. That\u2019s often <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">not <\/span>true with sample libraries.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Ensembles<\/span><br \/>\nI haven\u2019t mentioned the unique interactive interface you get when you purchase any WIVI instrument bundle (brass, woodwind, and sax bundles are currently available, with more planned). Besides letting you adjust any WIVI parameter (many of which can also be set in real time via MIDI), the interface graphically depicts a performance space (such as a hall, studio, church, or anechoic chamber) in which you can place either a single WIVI instrument or an <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ensemble <\/span>of like or different instruments relative to an imaginary listener. The position of each instrument relative to the listener establishes stereo pan, of course. But since acoustics of the depicted performance space are modeled, too, position also affects the ratios of direct sound, early reflections, and late reflections, and therefore the depth of each player within the perceived acoustic space. And if this reverberation implementation doesn\u2019t suit your purposes, there is a way to bypass it and eliminate the pertinent computations, without losing the panning setup. I\u2019m doing this because I need to use my WIVIs along with sample-based VIs from other vendors and I want all these instruments to run through a common reverb setup.<\/p>\n<p>If you prefer, you can put each instrument instance in its own plugin. But if you like to streamline your workflow by using instrument ensembles, you may find WIVI ensembles to be a great asset. First, you can design your own polyphonic ensemble. By comparison, sample libraries usually offer only a limited selection of ensembles. Second, you can put an ensemble into a single plug-in instance if you like, which optimizes computational efficiency. Each instrument can be assigned to a different MIDI channel for individual control (subject to the usual 16-channel limit), or they can all be assigned to the same channel, or anything in between. Third, if several instruments are assigned to the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">same <\/span>MIDI channel, you can take advantage of Wallander\u2019s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">polyphonic mode<\/span> to automatically assign parts of chords to different instruments in the ensemble \u2013 potentially saving you a lot of work. Controls in the interface allow you to specify the rules by which this is done. Fantastic.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to see polyphonic mode and many other WIVI features in action, check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wallanderinstruments.com\/\">Polyphonic Mode demo<\/a> on the Wallander home page. Scroll down to the bottom of the page to find the demo. For a more intimate experience that lets you try out <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">all <\/span>of the WIVIs, I suggest the Wallander Instruments demo available at <a href=\"http:\/\/try-sound.com\/\">Try-Sound.com<\/a>. And a free <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wallanderinstruments.com\/?menu=products&amp;download_trial=1\">WIVI Trial Edition<\/a>, downloadable from the Wallander site, includes the complete interactive environment and several (but not all) of the available WIVIs.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Scope of the WIVI Family<\/span><br \/>\nWhat about the range of WIVI instruments available? You\u2019ve probably noticed I haven\u2019t said anything about <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">strings <\/span>so far. That\u2019s because there is no string product at the present time. Wallander is well aware of this, and is known to be considering adding strings to the WIVI family. Unfortunately, it seems doubtful that string WIVIs will appear soon, due to the complexity of the undertaking. For now, I\u2019m using sampled strings \u2013 and percussion instruments, for that matter \u2013 from other vendors. They mix fine with my WIVIs, though I have to put up with the slow load times and realism disadvantages associated with sample libraries.<\/p>\n<p>Coverage of woodwinds is excellent, as 13 different types are available (in three bundles) with three or more variations of each. In fact, in a project I\u2019m working on, I needed an E-flat clarinet, for which a WIVI exists. I own many sample libraries from one of the major vendors, but none of them offers this instrument. Another major vendor\u2019s sample library offers it, but the cost of adding it to my collection is high. This was one of the factors that pushed me to try using WIVIs, and I\u2019m very pleased with the result. Similar situations exist with other \u201cspecialty\u201d instruments.<\/p>\n<p>There are two WIVI saxophone bundles, covering 9 different sax types. I don\u2019t have these yet, so I can\u2019t say much about them.<\/p>\n<p>Four WIVI brass instrument types are available at present, in the Brass 1 bundle. However, if you take account of all the muted variations of the basic types, the WIVI Brass 1 bundle can actually be thought of as including 23 distinct instrument types. Adding another bundle of brass instruments is said to be high in Wallander\u2019s priorities.<\/p>\n<p>By the way, you can buy a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sweetwater.com\/store\/search.php?s=WIVI&amp;go=Go%21\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">WIVI Epic Bundle<\/span><\/a> which includes <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">all<\/span> of the WIVIs currently available, at a large discount relative to the sum of the separate bundle prices.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">WIVI in the School of Chops<\/span><br \/>\nI\u2019m putting my WIVIs, sample libraries, DAW, computer, and skills to the test with a large project: sequencing Stravinsky\u2019s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Rite Of Spring<\/span>. Great for my School of Chops objectives. I\u2019m reaching for the Holy Grail: being able to have the entire orchestra running in one, unified environment (one computer running Cubase 5), with everything available to be edited at any time \u2013 i.e., no tracks frozen. So far, so good. At the moment, my orchestra incorporates 38 woodwind and brass WIVIs, as well as sampled strings. I haven\u2019t added percussion yet. Although I have a 64-bit computer and OS (Vista Ultimate), I\u2019ve found it advantageous to run the orchestra under the 32-bit version of Cubase 5. This is because all presently-available WIVIs operate in 32-bit mode. They also run under 64-bit Cubase 5, but then Steinberg\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/knowledgebase.steinberg.net\/262_1.html\">VST Bridge<\/a> comes into play, creating significant overhead. Fortunately, by using relatively little RAM, my WIVIs help keep the memory used by my 32-bit plugins below the 4 Gbyte limit. Right now, until I add more plugins, I\u2019m using about 25% or less of all eight of my CPU cores, and about 3.2 Gbytes of RAM out of 16 Gbytes available. So there\u2019s still headroom.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Bottom Lines<\/span><br \/>\nOf course, you want to know how my WIVIs <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sound<\/span>. Overall, I\u2019m very happy with them. Most of the instruments sound <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">very <\/span>good. The jury is out regarding a few, which seem to sound more \u201cbreathy\u201d and less resonant than I expect. I\u2019ve been working around this problem with EQ \u2013 but there are a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">lot <\/span>of WIVI parameters I haven\u2019t mastered yet, and it may be that I can get closer to what I need by adjusting them. WIVIs <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">should <\/span>sound realistic, because the parameters of the model on which each one is based have been derived by automatic analysis of real instrument waveforms. And Arne Wallander is a smart guy.<\/p>\n<p>Though I\u2019ve focused on WIVIs in this article, my purpose has been to get you thinking about alternatives to sampling, with due recognition that there are worthy model-based products other than WIVIs on the market, and that sampling still has its place.<\/p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"height: 15px; margin-top: 10px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" href=\"http:\/\/reblog.zemanta.com\/zemified\/0327b37d-5ea7-492f-b8d0-ad26201b529c\/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"float: right;\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" src=\"http:\/\/img.zemanta.com\/reblog_e.png?x-id=0327b37d-5ea7-492f-b8d0-ad26201b529c\" \/><\/a><script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"http:\/\/static.zemanta.com\/readside\/loader.js\"><\/script><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019m hard at work in the School of Chops, learning about writing for traditional orchestra.
