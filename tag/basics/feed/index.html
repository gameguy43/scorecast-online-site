In the 46th episode of the SCOREcast Podcast Show, Deane and Brian visit with Greg Curtis, owner of <em>The Bridge Recording</em> in Los Angeles, which is one of the busiest scoring stages in the LA basin. Greg explains how he has stayed at the top of the scoring studio business by applying cutting-edge technology, strategies and staying composer-focussed in the design of his company. The boys then engage in a long conversation about how to navigate just about any political scenario you might encounter in your media music career. Deane and Brian cover strategies for working for directors and producers, pleasing studio heads, collaborating with other composers, and even hiring or working with family and friends.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Your artistic quality has been called into question. And it hurts. Might be true, might not be... but from time to time every artist, no matter the discipline, needs to check the 'ol barometer.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The film music culture over the years has a developed a bit of an elitist complex in the way we talk about the artform, leading some to believe that if you don&#8217;t have little black dots as prevalent as you have red blood cells in your veins then you must not be trying very hard. After all, we were born with this, right? It&#8217;s in our DNA.</p>
<p>Arguable, at best. A lot of people say we were born with certain aptitudes toward this gig but I would argue that while that might be true about musical intuition and a predisposition toward cognitive retention of scales  and other functional repeating mathematical sequences, quality skilled composition only comes out of tireless practice, varied experience and loads of trial and error. It&#8217;s not a far-flung theory then to assume that there could be a serious self-esteem issue working against emerging composers, dare I say even veteran ones who are willing to admit the ugly truth. Are we <em>Weenies</em>? <em>Wimps</em>? <em>Candie-asses</em>? I don&#8217;t think so. But we <em>are</em> human beings and from time to time every artist, no matter the discipline, needs to check the &#8216;ol barometer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>You&#8217;re Not a Bad Composer</h1>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you can&#8217;t seem to write anything today.</strong></h3>
<p>Writer&#8217;s block sucks. But even though the cool thing to say is &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time for that&#8221;, that still doesn&#8217;t mean it never happens. The truth is that it does happen&#8230; to everybody. You aren&#8217;t a bad composer if you are not able to write for whatever reason. You might be a <em>late</em> composer, but you aren&#8217;t a bad one.</p>
<p>How to get rid of it? Studies show that stress is the leading cause of &#8220;mental blocking&#8221; and that eliminating stress-related activities or events in your life can also lower your chances of stalling out creatively. Want to drill down further? Those same studies show that the number one cause of stress, at least among Americans, is <em>finances</em>. If that means something to you&#8230; get on it. Scale back, pare down, save more, spend less, slash and burn, budget hard, charge more — whatever you need to do, but get that financial monkey off your back, and fast. It&#8217;s a killer. Literally.</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you don&#8217;t understand the theories behind music in film.</strong></h3>
<p>It just means you have a few things to learn if you are to be as effective a film music writer as you can be. You might already be an effective composer, but as a film composer you have to intimately understand the marriage of music and drama. If you don&#8217;t, then you are missing a huge piece of the puzzle as a talented composer looking to crack this particular medium. Obviously you aren&#8217;t a bad composer if this skill still eludes you, but I&#8217;ll warn you that without it you are always going to be composing from a <em>defensive</em> posture — meaning that whatever is thrown at you, you&#8217;ll either need to be lucky enough to intuitively feel it and magically hit that bullseye on the first dart throw or you&#8217;ll need to study up every time out, whether that&#8217;s through asking seasoned vets or &#8220;listening&#8221; to seasoned vets via Netflix streaming. Point being, you&#8217;ll always be playing &#8220;catch up&#8221;. That game gets old fast, slows you down, and eventually begins to erode your confidence.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t worry&#8230; it&#8217;s an easy fix. All you have to do is find a way to absorb the principles and theories behind drama. Extended viewing and note-taking can do it, but so will auditing a few film appreciation courses at the local community college. Or reading a stack of good books on the subject. I&#8217;d recommend starting with Earle Hagen&#8217;s <a href="http://amzn.com/0882844474" target="_blank"><em>Advanced Techniques for Film Scoring</em></a>. Hagen&#8217;s book is grossly outdated in its purview of technology, but the score analysis and score/script interaction is second to none. If you really want to steam your head, pick up Fred Karlin&#8217;s classic brick of a book <a href="http://amzn.com/0415941369" target="_blank"><em>On the Track</em></a>. Often referred to as &#8220;the film scoring bible&#8221;, <em>On the Track</em> offers probably the most extensive perspective on various approaches to dramatic writing for the medium of film.</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you&#8217;ve been rejected, fired or ignored. A lot.</strong></h3>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean you suck. Not necessarily, anyway. Although, a case could be made that if you got so far as to pitch for the gig it won&#8217;t matter if you suck anyway because you obviously have what it takes to get through the door. Any well-heeled major player knows <em>that ain&#8217;t easy</em>. But being told that &#8220;your music just isn&#8217;t what we&#8217;re looking for&#8221; is tough. What&#8217;s tougher, though, is hearing that time and again. And even still, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you are a bad composer. You&#8217;ll have to gauge this one for yourself and use your best and most honest evaluations of your output, but there have been plenty of people — hundreds — who&#8217;ve been turned down dozens upon dozens of times before they ever scored a note to picture and even more than that who&#8217;ve been successful and then been told they were washed up, irrelevant, too old, too young, too inexperienced, too expensive, too high-profile, not high-profile enough&#8230; you name it. Point being: Rejection happens and you have to learn to accept it and deal with it appropriately.</p>
<p>There are many ways to face rejection, accept whatever truths come with it, and then discard the parts that don&#8217;t matter. One way is to be sure that you have the most healthy self-esteem you can have outside of your role as a creative person. I married a wonderful woman whom my every heartbeat pounds for. So, I don&#8217;t live every moment to be a composer or to even be a musician. It&#8217;s certainly a gigantic part of who I am at my core, but there are things and people in my life who are more important than any of this will ever be. I&#8217;m not alone in this feeling. Ask anyone who is creative and probably over the age of thirty. The secondary things in life, you realize over time, matter very little. Success takes on a whole new definition when love, children, family, and even the closest friends take root in your life as a middle-aged person. I spend a huge majority of my time trying to hip younger people who are ready to jump off the cliff of career suicide to this fact. When you get rejected, it&#8217;s not a rejection of <em>you as a person</em>, it&#8217;s simply that the timing of your artistic expression and that of the source material don&#8217;t align. That&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s the wrinkle of cosmic scheduling. You could bring the same set of demo cues to the next meeting and have the biggest film in history on your hands. Nobody knows. But whatever the case, rejection should only hit your art, not your heart. It&#8217;s just not worth it and it never ever lasts anyway, so why devote the emotional bandwidth?</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you don&#8217;t know how to read music.</strong></h3>
<p>Clearly, you will be at major and immediate disadvantage if you don&#8217;t read music and you are trying to break into the scene. Not only does this hamper your speed and agility as the point person for the music department on a production, but it will also hurt you as a potential candidate for an apprenticeship — the avenue by which a lot of film composers get their start. Like it or not, and argue all you want, but the film music business still thrives and depends on people who can read dots on a page. Period. Whether you are a musician at a session, an orchestrator sorting out lines for the composer, a copyist handling last-minute changes, or the composer yourself, you will need to read often. Written music comprehension is to a composer what the interpreting of blueprints is to an architect. Not knowing how to read the architectural drawings on the house you are building will be an unmitigated disaster. Imagine being a non-reading composer on the scoring stage and having to quickly change a lead-line for your director, transpose it in your head, and rattle it off to your 1st chair trumpet or clarinetist. Can you imagine? Well, please do&#8230; because that exact scenario is not a rare experience for the in-the-trenches film composer.</p>
<p>Does not reading make you a <em>bad</em> composer? Of course not. Even a few top-tier composers in the game started out just humming their melodies to an orchestrator. But before long, almost all of them learned to read and write at least functionally. Need to brush up? Take some private lessons; there are hundreds of teachers in LA, NYC, and London who will take you on as a private student and bring you up to functional and workable levels in no time. Don&#8217;t be embarrassed by your inability to read notes; not all composers who are working today are ace readers, either, and no matter how good you are, I promise you your musicians will always be ten times better anyway. But even still, having that very basic ability in your skill set will remove what is probably the biggest hurdle to self-confidence as a composer. It is your job as the captain of this ship to have a solid grasp of the fundamentals. This is as fundamental as it gets.</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you don&#8217;t live in a music mecca.</strong></h3>
<p>There you are&#8230; in Delaware. Don&#8217;t worry. Geographical misfortune does not a bad composer make. There&#8217;s been a lot of talk in the last decade about geography and how it correlates to the level of sophistication of a composer, implying that the farther away you are from a major music center the less &#8220;dedicated&#8221; you must be to your craft. Obviously that&#8217;s bullshit. It doesn&#8217;t matter where you live, your talents are your talents. Now, how accessible your talents are to those who need them&#8230; well, that&#8217;s another matter entirely.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re not a <em>bad</em> composer if you live in Cornwall. Still living with the folks in Texarkana? No problem. Never underestimate the powerful combo of a gigabit Internet connection and a fair amount of good old-fashioned hustle. You can accomplish a lot with an IMDbPro account, a well thought-out demo reel and a cell phone. But if you are determined to be in the thick of the film world, the brick and mortar studios are all still standing in Los Angeles. Film and TV seem to be the only industries who haven&#8217;t figured out that the world is flat like the video game industry has. They are making strides in that direction, but they aren&#8217;t there yet. Post-production on films and shows happens in LA.</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; just because somebody says you are.</strong></h3>
<p>Human beings are strange creatures. We love to kick our wounded. I don&#8217;t know what it is, but people will love you when it&#8217;s easy to and hate you when it&#8217;s easier. There is nothing that will take the wind out of your sails more than negative feedback from colleagues. Complete strangers? Whatevs. But colleagues&#8230; That&#8217;s a tough knife in the gut. And there are those out there who are self-loathing enough to let you have it. Believe me. As I&#8217;ve just finished a very personal project, the barbs from the people I figured would lob them last have found their mark. And for a while, I internalized every one, taking it apart and searching for where I&#8217;d gone wrong. But then I realized that those people are not my audience. Do you make music for other musicians? I sure don&#8217;t. So what was I worried about?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: The people who love what you do love it because it does something for them. It fills something in them. It cures what&#8217;s ailing, if only for five minutes. That is your <em>audience</em>. <em>The</em> <em>fans</em>. Not the freaks&#8230; <em>the fans</em>. The freaks are just freaking. They need something to freak about so that they don&#8217;t have to keep staring at their own work. There will be people who &#8220;get&#8221; what you do and there will be people who just don&#8217;t and never will. Just accept that those people aren&#8217;t the people you are doing this for and they likely never will be. Don&#8217;t read your comment feed. Never punch down. Even the biggest stars in entertainment get railed by the folks who are sitting at home doing nothing. If you happen to convert a non-believer through consistent output that ultimately changes their mind, awesome&#8230; You&#8217;re lucky. That doesn&#8217;t happen often. Take great care of them and don&#8217;t abuse their commitment to your art by following up with a piece of crap. But if you never do, remember who you are playing to: <em>Your fans</em>. The dedicated few. Your niche. Your tribe. Your supporters. The people who will join your mailing list, share your content in their social circles, attend your panel discussions, and email occasionally to tell you they &#8220;enjoyed this last one&#8221;. That is the person you are working for. That is where your mental bandwidth deserves allocation. Not thinking about how to <em>get new fans</em>&#8230;. but thinking about how to care for the ones who are here already. That&#8217;s an endgame that matters.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[What to do when your organizable musical structure relies on a moving visual target.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jai Meghan&#8217;s recent Open Forum Friday <a href="../../../2010/10/open-forum-friday-getting-organized.html" target="_blank">article</a> on &#8220;getting organized&#8221; got me thinking about a <em>different</em> way of organizing: How composers organize their ideas within a piece of music. According to Wikipedia the word &#8220;composer&#8221; comes from the Latin <em>compônere</em>, meaning &#8220;one who puts together&#8221;. In a sense, composing a piece of music is really about <em>organizing</em>—organizing notes into themes and melodies, melodies into phrases, phrases into coherent sections, and so on.</p>
<p>The Classical forms like Rondo, Sonata, Compound Ternary, etc. all serve as extremely useful road-maps for developing musical material. The Rondo form, for example (ie. ABACA), gives us a blueprint for balancing a main theme with contrasting sections. After the main theme we have a contrasting section, and after every contrasting section we return to the main theme. Thus, the perfect sense of coherence and unity by repetitions of the main theme, balanced by variety and interest from the contrasting sections.</p>
<p>All of this is great to know when you&#8217;re sitting down to write a new composition to be performed in a concert hall. But how does this information stay relevant when scoring to picture? What do you do when your entire musical structure depends on the visual?</p>
<p>Picture is king. Even if you are struck with inspiration and would love nothing more than to have your main theme run off into a fugue, you&#8217;re not entirely in charge. If it doesn&#8217;t support the picture, it doesn&#8217;t make the score.</p>
<p>As you have probably already experienced either in your own scores or while watching other films, sometimes it doesn&#8217;t take much for the music to be dramatically effective. Even just a slowly thumping bass drum can be enough to support the picture in a compelling way. Where are the balanced sections in that cue? The audience isn&#8217;t particularly interested in how you transitioned from the B section back to the main theme, they&#8217;re interested in what&#8217;s happening on screen.</p>
<p>It would seem that perhaps the classical forms are backwards thinking, while a film cue is forward thinking. The structured forms are about developing the material that you&#8217;ve already heard; the contrasting B section isn&#8217;t a contrast if you haven&#8217;t yet heard A. But film music seems to be more about the present and future moments, building tension and preparing (or in some cases defying) expectations.</p>
<p>If there is still a place for form in film music, perhaps it&#8217;s only in those places where the audience is actually paying attention to the music. In the main titles, for example, or a montage that is mostly score driven.</p>
<p>So what do you think? Is musical form relevant when writing to picture? Are the traditional methods of organizing musical material still useful in the world of film scoring?</p>
<p>The comments are open below.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[There are 12 tones, and only so much you can do. Right, James Horner?]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>James Horner once said, &#8220;There are only 12 tones. There&#8217;s only so much you can do.&#8221; Interesting theory, but is it true? Some of you will say that Horner is just lazy. Hmm. Others will say, &#8220;He has a point: Perhaps that&#8217;s why much of the film music we hear today seems a bit derivative.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whichever, his comment raises a pertinent question amongst Creatives: Is there a limit to what can be created from an <em>original</em> place?</p>
<p>Indeed, what constitutes &#8220;originality&#8221;? To take it a step further, what makes for a truly <em>original film score</em>? Is it the sound? The composer? The approach? The use of instruments? Or none of the above&#8230; or ALL of the above? Why do you feel the way you do about your take on it?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s hard to talk about what you <strong><em>suck</em></strong> at. It&#8217;s no fun. Nonetheless, it is vital if you want to grow and get better. The tough thing about your own weaknesses is that you are usually the last person to identify them, and it seems like others can sometimes be just a liiiiiiitle too happy to point them out to you—usually when you really don&#8217;t want to hear them!</p>
<p>Learning how to identify and examine your weaknesses as a composer, mixer, orchestrator, editor, player, copyist, manager/agent, executive&#8230; whatever, is an important step in creating the career you&#8217;ve always wanted. However, it doesn&#8217;t end there. If you really want to move yourself to the next level, not only do you have to figure out what your weaknesses are, but then you have to find a way to <em>conquer</em> them. You have to follow through on a solution if you want achieve more for yourself.</p>
<p>With that: <em>What is your biggest weakness?</em> And more importantly, <em>how do you plan to conquer it?</em></p>

Be careful how you answer this one: We are certainly aware of the risk involved in even putting this question out there—we are inviting a deluge of the token <em>&#8220;writing music is who I am&#8221;</em> comments.</p>
<p>If we are honest, though, simply <em>writing</em> is not the primary motivator amongst most who do it everyday. First of all, there are far more easier paths to creative self-realization, and secondly there are far more important things in the overall grand scheme of life itself. After all, if you lost everyone and everything in your life tomorrow, we&#8217;d bet money that the least important &#8220;treasure&#8221; would be all of the shows you&#8217;ve worked on, right?</p>
<p>Some are motivated by the joy of &#8220;making stuff&#8221;, and music just happens to be the conduit by which they are able to do so. Others might be motivated by the fact that they are able to support their family doing such a thing as working in film music, while even others might be driven by the mere fact that they don&#8217;t know how to do anything else! Then again, maybe you just like to&#8230;oh, I don&#8217;t know&#8230; EAT.</p>
<p>There are hundreds, if not millions, of potentially motivating factors involved in choosing a career in film music. And so, we ask YOU: What <em>TRULY</em> motivates you to continue on in this tough business? Yeah, yeah, yeah&#8230; we get it—<em>you were &#8220;made to do this!&#8221;</em> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But what is it that <em>REALLY</em> keeps you coming back time and time again to have another go, frame after frame, note after note, film after film?</p>

<li><a href="../../../2010/08/deane-ogden-caveats-of-convenient-film-composing-pt-1.html" target="_blank">Caveats of Convenience: Part I</a></li>
</ul>
<p>[/slidingnote]</p>
<p>While we often love to talk about what we do right most of the time, these few posts speak instead to some things that I’ve observed film composers doing <em>wrong</em> lately. Of course, that statement in and of itself is highly subjective, but I think there are some habits that are starting to trend that, while possibly not evident right away, will prove down the line to be detrimental to doing business as a film composer in our continually evolving market. I see this list of choices as “temptations of convenience”, and this series might also be called “The Seduction of the Easy Way Out”. In this economy and composing climate, I see a lot of composers taking these routes and while none of them are necessarily “bad”, I’ll try to make the case as to why I believe most of them should be avoided.</p>
<h3>Caveat #2: Fame</h3>
<p>I was at my manager&#8217;s birthday party a few weeks ago and was asked by someone who read my first installment in this series, &#8220;Why did you say, <em>&#8216;You&#8217;ll never become famous being a film composer?&#8217; </em>That&#8217;s not true. There are several people who have become famous composing for films.” This person went on to cite several people who we might all agree could be considered famous in our field: John WIlliams, Jerry Goldsmith, James Horner, and more recently—Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard.</p>
<p>While I would agree that each of those people—and more—are quite famous within the circles of film music, I would not be too quick to say that they are famous as we would define fame within our society&#8217;s immediate cultural definition of the term. For example, ask a person &#8220;Who is Michael Jackson?&#8221; and nine times out of ten you&#8217;ll hear, &#8220;He was the King of Pop.&#8221; Ask the same ten people &#8220;Who is John Williams?&#8221; and I&#8217;m not sure nine of them—or even <em>five</em> of them—would have any answer at the ready. A few may know, while others may only know if you hum a few bars of the &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; theme or the &#8220;Raiders March&#8221;, but the majority would have no clue. This is not to say that Williams isn&#8217;t every bit as influential on the modern landscape of American music. He most certainly has been. But with all due respect to &#8220;the Maestro&#8221;, the truth is that Michael Jackson and John Williams are worlds apart in the &#8220;fame&#8221; department.</p>
<p>In fact, the more I think about this question posed to me by this gentleman at the party, the more I stand behind my statement. First and foremost, “fame”, as defined by Webster&#8217;s, is “the state or quality of being widely honored and acclaimed.” I think we can all agree that by this definition, we as film composers—should we ever attain any great heights of fame and fortune—would be in the minority on this one. Michael Jackson; Michael Jordan; Michael Douglas… hell, Michael LOHAN (ugh!)—I hate to burst any bubbles, but film composers don&#8217;t even register as a blip on the radar screen of <em>that</em> kind of fame.</p>
<p>Secondly, I believe that if the impetus behind your drive to score films is <em>fame</em>, you are missing the point entirely. Maybe I should have said, &#8220;If you <em>want</em> to be famous, don&#8217;t be a composer.&#8221; Maybe that would have made the difference for my friend? I don&#8217;t know. What I <em>do</em> know is that although John Williams ended up being famous doing what he did, I&#8217;d bet money he never intended to write music for the purpose of “getting famous&#8221;. And <em>that’s</em> where I hope people are not headed as they choose to embark on their odyssey in film music. Like anything you put your hand to in life, you have to do it for the love of it, or you are doing it in vain. Period.</p>
<p><strong>The Difference Between <em>Fame </em>and <em>Greatness</em></strong><br />
I&#8217;ve made it a priority in my career to mentor a certain number of film music students during each cycle of work here at the Musicave. One recent student kept using the word &#8220;famous&#8221; every time we would talk about his career goals in our times together. I once asked him at what level a composer would need to be at in order to be free to pick and choose projects as they saw fit. &#8220;After you are <em>famous</em>,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;then you can do whatever you want. Until you get <em>famous</em>, you have to take anything you can get to build your career.&#8221; His choice to constantly use that word&#8230; &#8220;famous&#8221;&#8230; it grated on me like fingernails on a chalkboard. I finally confronted him about it. Susie and I took him to dinner and I told him, &#8220;Dude, we need to talk about something you have been saying that&#8217;s been nagging at me for a few days. This &#8216;getting famous&#8217; thing of yours&#8230; first of all, you are dreaming. That&#8217;s Number 1. Number 2, it&#8217;s just the wrong motivation for wanting to be in film music. No director gives a damn about your desire to &#8216;be famous&#8217;&#8230; they want to know if you love the story enough to give it your all&#8230; FOR THE FILM. It&#8217;s never about YOU. It&#8217;s always about the project.&#8221;</p>
<p>As we talked, the real problem came out. This poor kid has been told all his life that he&#8217;ll &#8220;never do anything <em>great</em>&#8220;. He&#8217;s been put down, stomped on, made to feel inferior, and basically just had every ounce of esteem kicked out of him by the very people who should have been supporting him the most. It became clear to me that this young man equated &#8220;fame&#8221; with &#8220;greatness&#8221;. In his mind, the best way to show those unbelieving people in his life that he was worth believing in was to become &#8220;famous&#8221; doing what they told him he could never and would never do <em>well</em>. Once I helped him identify the real problem, we were then able to have an important conversation about the vast difference between being <em>great</em> and being <em>famous</em>. For him, the delineation of those two ideas was a paradigm shift that he really needed to have if he was to ever stand a chance at this career. Maybe even at life in general.</p>
<p>The sad truth is that many of our graduating film music students are just like this young man once was. They do not understand the difference between <em>being great</em> and <em>being famous</em>. And how could they? Our culture glorifies <em>fame</em>, but places very little value on <em>greatness</em>. They&#8217;ve confused the two, thus sending young people on a wild goose chase to find this brass ring of &#8220;fame&#8221;. Think about this: How many people in your life were extremely popular (famous) but just really not that great of a person? See what I mean? It is a pathetic trend in our society that needs to seriously level off should we hope to extend any nobility to the next generation of film music innovators, or our children in general. There is an entire legion of aspiring composers entering the fold who simply want to be famous or make lots of money. There really are. If you don&#8217;t believe me, spend some time on the campus at some of our finer music schools. I have, and I&#8217;ve seen it with my own eyes and heard with my own ears. Ambition, to these misguided young minds, is simply a commodity to be bought and sold like stocks or widgets. It is something attainable by having as many Twitter followers as Justin Beiber or by having 30 or 40 comments on your Facebook statuses. These kids have seen too many episodes of &#8220;Entourage&#8221;—they&#8217;ve convinced themselves that the way to the top of the film music heap is by becoming the compositional version of &#8220;Vinnie Chase&#8221;. All they need is their &#8220;Ari&#8221; to help them get there.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fame</em> is not Enough</strong><br />
I wish I could stand in front of every film music student enrolled today and tell them that the desire for fame is not a valid reason for doing ANYTHING. To truly get all you can get out of something—in our case, film music—you must simply be in love with the mere act of doing it. Nothing more. I&#8217;m not even talking &#8220;results&#8221;, yet&#8230; I&#8217;m just talking about the <em>action</em> of it. It&#8217;s the <em>action</em> that must consume you. Writing film music must be critical to your very existence. You should love it so much that you go to sleep thinking about how you really should get up and do more of it, and you should be waking up in the morning already late to get back to doing it. The very process must be your only motivation, your every reason, and your insatiable drive for needing to do it some more. It has to be that one thing that you do, that were you ever not able to do it anymore, you would honestly cease to be complete in some unexplainable way—a vital component to your human contentment would be absent&#8230; and that vast expanse would not be a void that could be filled with dollars, fame, notoriety, or accolades. It would be a &#8220;music-shaped hole&#8221; that only writing music could fill again.</p>
<p>Fame doesn&#8217;t do any of that. Fame is a state of <em>being</em>, not a state of <em>process </em>or<em> an action</em>. Fame is not a <em>choice</em>. Fame is something that happens <em>to</em> you, not something you<em> make</em> happen. <em>Fame</em> relies on luck and chance, while <em>greatness</em> relies on consistency of character. Serenity, contentment, balance, and harmony—these are the motivating mechanisms that propel people toward <em>greatness</em>. In this light then, <em>fame</em>, it seems, is simply not enough.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My goal in starting this website and podcast has always been to make our professional film music community “smaller” as we naturally grow “larger”. Over the past year, our website has undergone many alterations and we&#8217;ve experimented with various ways to communicate and interact as a community. Some of these methods have worked and some of them have needed further tweaking, but we&#8217;ve always strived to make SCO the very best experience it can be. To commemorate our anniversary, we will be launching even more new features at SCOREcastOnline.com in the coming weeks that will make the site even more robust as we seek to better serve this community.</p>
<p>One of the things that I believe differentiates SCO from the rest of the pack is that we are all <em>working professionals</em>—none of us are offerring knowledge or putting something out there for public consumption that isn&#8217;t a tried and true method, technique, philosophy, or question in our own daily working film music routine. It annoys me to no end to encounter people who really have no idea what it is like being a working professional in this business, yet they either want to tell you all about how to do it or they have an opinion that they feel is relevant— never mind the fact that they haven&#8217;t written a note or edited or mixed music for the last fifteen years. How can this person *truly* know what it is like NOW in the film music business, other than to simply speculate on something they know very little about? (And for the record, I&#8217;m NOT talking to those of you who are just coming up in the biz—&#8221;Looking for&#8221; work and &#8220;talking about&#8221; work are two different things. To me, one is of merit. The other? Not so much.)</p>
<p>Which leads me to a potential discussion with you: <strong><em>GOING PRO</em></strong>. What does that mean? What is the difference between being a <em>professional</em> film composer, music editor, orchestrator—what have you—and being an <em>amateur</em> hobbyist?</p>
<p>Understand this difference: I&#8217;m NOT asking, &#8220;How does a person <em>make the leap</em> from being an amateur to being a professional?&#8221; Or even, &#8220;How do you <em>break into</em> the working community?&#8221; Instead, I&#8217;m seeking to illustrate and highlight the <em>differences</em> in the two species—because a working film composer and a film composer who isn&#8217;t working are two VERY different animals… and the reasons why, at least to me, are extremely telling and very educational for all of us at every stage of the career.</p>
<p>Like many of my working colleagues who&#8217;ve had any amount of success at this gig, I&#8217;ve lectured in plenty of film music classes at the university level. After years and years of doing so and talking with hundreds—if not thousands—of students, my spirit of discernment operates at a fairly high level: I&#8217;m able to tell which students have the chutzpah and internal drive to eventually find their way into the professional ranks and which ones do not.</p>
<p>I have a lot to say on this topic, and I&#8217;ll spread it out over the rest of May in various articles I&#8217;ll write, but in the meantime, and to get the party started, here are two immediate thoughts that come to mind that I feel are relevant to all of us:</p>
<p><strong>Personal Responsibility</strong><br />
Everyone screws up. On almost every project I&#8217;ve ever worked on, somebody somewhere has messed something up. Sometimes the mistake is small and it goes unnoticed and gets swept under the rug, and sometimes it&#8217;s a Category 5 disaster that cannot be ignored and the entire scoring team, from the studio executives on down, hears about the blunder. Usually, with some quick thinking and a little magic dust, it is fixable. Sometimes it costs the person their job.</p>
<p>No matter what, and in every case, a <em>professional</em> takes the responsibility for everything they do, good or bad, pretty or ugly. There is no pointing fingers, no whining about how someone else is to blame. If you did it, you own it.</p>
<p>As a film music pro, there is no surer way to kill your career than passing the responsibility buck. I used to compose music for NBC&#8217;s &#8220;The Apprentice&#8221;, and &#8220;The Celebrity Apprentice&#8221; is still a huge guilty pleasure in my home for both me and my family (I finally got them hooked!). One thing that has always fascinated me about that show is how well the teams work together and have each other&#8217;s backs. That is… UNTIL they get to the Boardroom, where they, without fail, start throwing each other under the bus in an effort to stay on one more week. While I understand that this is part of the dynamic that makes a show like this work, it still blows my mind how far people are willing to go to cast blame on others for what are so obviously their own poor decisions. Many times, Trump sees right through this kind of crap and yells, &#8220;You&#8217;re Fired!&#8221;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s worse? These are all people who are <em>working professionals</em>! Truthfully, I&#8217;ve lost much respect for many &#8220;celebrities&#8221; that I once held in high regard by watching them sell their teammates out to stay alive one more week. This isn&#8217;t an indictment on Reality TV. It is an indictment on not taking Personal Responsibility For Your Own Actions. You have to own your own shit. If you did it, face it and be a professional about it. Own up to it, fix it quick, and move on with getting your job done.</p>
<p>Everybody makes mistakes, but one of the things that differentiates a <em>professional</em> from an <em>amateur</em> is the ability to own up, apologize appropriately, and make things right.</p>
<p><strong>Acting vs. Reacting</strong><br />
This is another personal core value of mine, and it&#8217;s a doozy.</p>
<p>Are you the kind of person who <em>waits</em>? <em>Waits</em> for someone to call, <em>waits</em> until April 15th to file taxes, <em>waits</em> to have the tough conversation, <em>waits</em> to deal with broken gear, <em>waits</em> to put processes and people in place until &#8220;I absolutely need to&#8221;, <em>waits</em> to demo for a project until it shows up on IMDb, <em>waits</em>, <em>waits</em>, <em>waits</em>, <em>waits</em>, <em>waits</em>?????</p>
<p>If yes, then you&#8217;ve got a problem. Mark my words: You are going to have a hard time in the film music business.</p>
<p>Again, a delineation: I&#8217;m not talking about &#8220;timing&#8221;. <em>Appropriate Timing </em>is an art unto itself that I will discuss later this month as we dive deeper into Professionalism. No, I&#8217;m referring to &#8220;putting things off&#8221;. <em>Procrastinating</em>.</p>
<p>I like to do the opposite. I act NOW. If I hear about a project in it&#8217;s early stages of pre-production and I want it—I jump on it TODAY. Not tomorrow, not Friday… TODAY. If I learn of a potential scheduling conflict that is headed my way, I handle it this very second. I do not&#8230; <em>wait</em>.</p>
<p>I pay estimated quarterly taxes. I don&#8217;t wait for April 15th to do all of that work. I pay business expenses at the beginning of the month instead of at the end. I deal with staffing issues when they happen, not after they unfold. I take my team out for regular <em>play dates </em>instead of waiting until they are dragging ass and need a jolt of emergency R&amp;R.</p>
<p>I diagnose computers or take them to the &#8220;doctor&#8221; at the first sign of trouble rather than waiting for them to go belly-up two days before a deadline.</p>
<p>I initiate conversations with producers and directors and I do not wait for them to seek me out by word of mouth. I make it a point to network, socialize, and mingle. I work to meet and befriend at least one new person in my life every single day.</p>
<p>I return all of my calls and emails once in the morning and once before I go home for the day. I follow up with all of my team members on each project by sending something nice (when appropriate) or telling them in person how much I appreciate them.</p>
<p>All of these things are in an effort to <em>work ahead of schedule</em>. Ultimately, it all becomes important on the day that a big project hits my studio, along with the realization that if these things aren&#8217;t already done, they won&#8217;t get done for the next 4-6 weeks. At that point, it&#8217;s too late—I&#8217;m committed. The work now dictates how I can spend my time, and no matter what, I have to maintain focus to meet my project&#8217;s deadline. This means that many of these aforementioned tasks must fall by the wayside in order to meet that commitment, and so I must operated in my &#8220;downtime&#8221; with a bias toward working ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>Most people I have encountered that are only sort of poking around with the idea of making a career out of composing act exactly counter to the way I just described. They toy around with these things. But <em>professionals</em> don&#8217;t. And if you want to ascend to the next terrace in your career, you can&#8217;t either.</p>
<p>I had an instructor once who used to tell us that the best way to get to the next level in anything in life—sports, music, business, relationships, fitness… whatever—is to &#8220;start living and acting on that level&#8221;. How true this is.</p>
<p>Where are you headed and what do you need to change in order to get there?</p>
<p>I await your comments below.</p>

<p>The music you put and don’t put in a film will affect the pacing of the film, its architecture.  For you to do this well demands a solid understanding of story, screen writing, film’s unique visual language and the brains and experience to apply that knowledge to the unique film you are working on.</p>
<h4>Spotting</h4>
<p>The spotting session is where you discuss the film with the director and make the initial decisions about placement and function of music in the film.</p>
<p>But spotting should begin before that meeting. Do your homework, watch the film and come to the spotting session prepared.</p>
<p>Spotting also continues after the official spotting session, because new ideas will come to you as your musical material develops and you spend more time with the film (and edits keep coming.)</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“A wise man changes his mind, a fool never does.” ~ Spanish proverb</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Following are some thoughts about finding <em>form</em> during spotting.</p>
<h4>A Bird&#8217;s Eye View</h4>
<p>No scene exists in isolation; they are all affected by what comes before and what comes after. So to properly place music in a film you should first have a bird’s eye view of the entire story.</p>
<p>I suggest you do this on your own as part of your prep for the spotting session.</p>
<p>Some things to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the central idea of the film, the metaphor (define in as few words as possible)</li>
<li>What is the tone/mood of the film (again, just a few descriptive terms.)</li>
<li>Define the three acts, where the plot points are and what they do.</li>
<li>Durations of introduction and conclusion</li>
<li>How the character arc(s) fits in.</li>
<li>And anything else that is important for your particular film.</li>
<li>What is the genre?</li>
</ul>
<p>I like to graph out the form of the film. I jot down timings and descriptions as I watch the film, I then draw horizontal lines to clearly delineate the form; acts, scenes etc.</p>
<p>I think of it like a painter doing a sketch on his canvas to get the shapes right. If you go right to the details, these smaller parts will be all out of proportion. I am a visual guy and doing this really helps me.</p>
<p>This overview is a good first subject of discussion at the spotting session to make sure you and the director are on the same page.</p>
<h4>Swooping In</h4>
<p><strong></strong>With a view of the whole in place, you can now move in to the details: <em>the individual cues</em>.</p>
<p>Obviously, the most important thing is the story. The start and end of a cue should be chosen to support the story.  That being said, here are some visual devices that directors often use to highlight important story and structural elements in a film:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom in – Zoom out</li>
<li>Dolly shot – tracking shot</li>
<li>Crane shot</li>
<li>Close ups (especially close ups that then zoom out. Often used to start a new section.)</li>
<li>Wide shots – long shots (such as in establishing shots, often at the starts of a new section.)</li>
<li>Fade in, fade out, cross fades, wipes etc…</li>
</ul>
<p>Some story driving elements which may not be accompanied by a fancy camera move:</p>
<ul>
<li>Something in the acting</li>
<li>A line of dialogue</li>
<li>An action</li>
<li>A prop</li>
<li>A plot point</li>
</ul>
<p>And remember, always consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where you are <em>in</em> the film</li>
<li>What comes before and after musically and in the story</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let us see some of these things through some examples.</p>
<h4>Big Introductions</h4>
<p>The introduction sets the tone for the film and must usually be approached differently than music in other parts of the film.</p>
<p>Here is a great example, from “The Rocketeer” by James Horner. (Say what you will about Horner, he knows how to spot a film.)</p>
<p>In this very cinematic introduction, Horner helps to create that introductory feeling by playing his melody right through the cuts, the dialogue and the various actions. But he still expertly follows structural points such as wide shots, close ups and important actions. And he does it while making a cohesive musical statement.</p>
<p>As you watch this scene, here are some things to watch out for as you watch this scene.</p>
<ul>
<li>00:00 &#8211; Film opens with credits on black. Melody in piano. Notice how the melody fits perfectly within the duration of the credits.</li>
<li>00:36 &#8211; hangar doors open. Melody is taken over by the strings.</li>
<li>02:06 &#8211; cockpit comes down signaling the start of the flight. The melody starts again here. Everything makes musical sense and follows the on-screen action. They talk and start the plane, the melody plays right through all that.</li>
<li>02:36 &#8211; Static wide shot as the plane rolls through the screen. Change of mood, B section? The music is bustling and creates anticipation. This static wide shot differs from the other shots so far, making it stand out. A good choice for a change in the music.</li>
<li>03:16 &#8211; extreme close up of eyes as Cliff puts on his goggles. The extreme close up is structural, signaling the start of the takeoff. Music changes, getting more intense.</li>
<li>03:52 &#8211; take off! This important action doesn’t need any special camera angle! The music soars. But through the flight, the dialogue and the acrobatics, the melody just plays right through.</li>
<li>04:37 &#8211; plane flying towards frame left. The music cadences just before and stops before the next cut.</li>
<li>04:42 &#8211; cut: guy shooting a Tommy gun at towards audience and moving away from camera. This is a textbook structural shot that signals the start of a new section. Horner stops the music there, but what is most important is that the music doesn’t resume once we see the plane again. This would have negated the feeling of introduction he created in the first 6 minutes, which that musical form in film is just as much about where you put music as where you don’t.</li>
</ul>

<p>Good spotting is as much about where you put your music as where you don’t!</p>
<h4>Small Introductions</h4>
<p><strong></strong>Individual scenes can also have introductions and conclusions. Not all scenes have sections of course; some are shorter, transitory scenes, but longer set-pieces often do.</p>
<p>As an example, I have chosen the Boat Chase from “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade” by John Williams. This is a great example of an introduction within a scene.</p>
<ul>
<li>36:32 -Indy and Elsa come out of the sewer. There is no music. There was tons of music in the previous scene(s) so it’s good to have a break here, and it makes room for the humor.</li>
<li>36:48 – “Ah Venice” and Kazim comes out. Music starts here, being only an introduction which leads to the melody that starts when we…</li>
<li>37:19 &#8211; Cut to boat with guy hanging behind. This is the start of the boat chase proper and the melody begins here! All the running before was leading to this, so it made sense for the music to lead up to the melody!</li>
</ul>
<p><em> (EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE: Unfortunately, this clip is not available at YouTube.com, so you&#8217;ll have to pop in the DVD.)</em></p>
<p>JW is a master at structuring scenes using logical musical form. So it is always a good idea to listen to the music of the masters in the context of the film.<strong> </strong></p>
<h4>What&#8217;s It About?</h4>
<p><strong></strong>More important than the cut and fancy camera angles is knowing what the scene is about, and sometimes that means playing the music over cuts that seem like a start or an ending. A great example is the meeting of Daryl Van Horne in “The Witches of Eastwick.”</p>
<p>The scene starts where everyone is trying to remember Van Horne’s name but no one can. But most importantly, this scene is about Van Horne’s first contact with these ladies. Always know what your scene is about.</p>
<ul>
<li>22:00 &#8211; close up of card and roses, and pull back. Music in.</li>
<li>22:24 &#8211; low angle shot as pearls fall and everyone starts to remember his name. Music follows.</li>
<li>22:38 &#8211; crazy lady breaks her leg. Music follows.</li>
<li>23:06 &#8211; establishing shot of exterior of Cher’s house, a cross fade AND a close up! Now this would look like a place to have the music out with all these visual signals of form, but Cher is still thinking about Daryl Van Horne and, do you remember what is going on in this part of the story? So JW plays through and leads straight to…</li>
<li>23:54 &#8211; “Looking for me?” This is the first contact with Van Horne and the music comes out here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that is smart spotting, which totally helps the form, flow and the direction of the story.</p>
<p>The bottom line is spotting is about knowing what the important structural elements are, then using that to guide the form of your music, both on the cue level and on the level of the entire film.</p>
<p>There is of course a lot more we could discuss about structure and spotting. Zemickis and Silvestri are also brilliant at this. I suggest you look at “Back to the Future’ and how the music changes at an important plot point at the end of the first act. Or the way “Cast Away” was spotted.</p>
<h4>Comments</h4>
<p><strong></strong>&#8230; are open below. Can you point to any other examples of great spotting? Let&#8217;s hear them!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s no secret that 2009 was a slow year for a ton of people. Coming off the slump that the world economy has been in for the last two years, for many facets of the entertainment biz, things couldn&#8217;t get much worse. As we’ve wrapped up this last year, I have heard numerous sighs of relief, seen many puffed up cheeks of exhaustion, and felt the overwhelming dark cloud of “what now?” on Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter. Generally, it seems that most of us are perfectly happy to blow a kiss goodbye to the last decade and get on with this new one that, just like that, is suddenly upon us.</p>
<p>As we focus on this new year, and with that, the new topic here at SCO of “Getting the Gig”, I’d like to encourage you and your business by suggesting something to you that you may not appreciate. You know — one of those slightly annoying Ogden diatribes that gets under your skin, pisses you off, and just generally makes you angry that I even decided to post on SCO today to begin with. Just think of me as the one guy in your corner who won’t always tell you what you want to hear. I’ll leave that to the 1.1 million other people in Hollywood! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Someone who was a huge influence in my life was the late great Michael Kamen. I was fortunate to study under Michael for a very short time before he passed, and I learned a lot from him about this gig and how to sustain a career in it. I also learned about the importance of an encouraging word and a helpful heart &#8211; two things that Michael believed in and practiced daily.</p>
<p>One of Michael’s favorite things to say to any of us students was always “There’s no crying in film scoring!” This, of course, was his paraphrase of a famous line from the Penny Marshall film A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN, when Tom Hanks’ Jimmy Dugan proclaims to a sobbing female infielder, “There’s no crying in baseball!”</p>
<p>Michael Kamen was right. There, in fact, *is* no crying in film scoring. If you are upset about the way that your career is going, change it. Don’t pout, blame, whine, accuse, or assign the reasons for your failures to anyone or anything but yourself. You can’t. You own them all. They are yours, whether you like it or not. The trick to this gig (or any gig, for that matter) is when you get knocked off the horse, dust your ass off and get back up on it again. Keep moving ahead. Keep writing music. Don’t stop writing for a single second.</p>
<p>When you are not writing film music, you are not being a film composer. You are being&#8230; whatever it is that you are doing other than writing. An office assistant, , a gofer, a professional lunch eater, whatever. But you aren&#8217;t being a film composer. So stop that. If this last year felt slow and you are afraid of another slow year, get busy and make some calls. Go to some parties. Connect with some writers or directors or gaffers or location scouts or costume designers. Find out what <em>they</em> are working on, and find an “in”. Schedule a meeting with the principals. DO something.</p>
<p>2010 is not going to be the “Year of the Whiner”. It is going to be the year in which those who have their heads in the game and get their asses moving are going to be the ones getting the gigs. It’s all about “hustle”; it’s all about desire; it&#8217;s all about action. What are YOU willing to do to get on your next show? Are you willing to demo five times for FREE? You might have to. In fact, you&#8217;ll probably have to. Are you willing to fork out that extra grand you really don’t have right now so that you can have a decent string library to mock-up cues with? Better yet: Are you willing to spend the $10,000 it would take to hire an LA string section to touch up those demo cues you wrote in November?</p>
<p>What will you “risk” in order to “achieve” this year? What will you <em>not</em> do this year that you did too much of last year? What will you do more of in 2010 that you should have done more of in ’09? Time to take inventory.</p>
<p>Yes. Take a good, hard, honest look at how you ran your business in 2009 and ask yourself the tough questions. Were you a hustler last year, or did you rely on others to pick up the phone and call you? Did you invest in yourself at all (via gear, promotion, networking, etc.), or is the &#8220;awareness needle&#8221; at about the same hash-mark that it was this time last year for you in the film production community?</p>
<p>Last thing: Have you already started this new year&#8230; this new DECADE&#8230; with a negative attitude? It’s a tired adage, but it’s a true one: Attitude is everything. <em>Maybe you should be being thankful that you are still in the game at all!</em> This is a tough business and a difficult career choice. I’ve said it before: If you are great at something else besides scoring films, please&#8230; for the love of all that&#8217;s holy&#8230; DO THAT! This gig is not easy. I said all that to say that if you are still here after a year of trying, kudos to you. Seriously. Most people are long gone by now. You should be proud of yourself and excited to kick 2010’s ass. That&#8217;s no small feat.</p>
<p>We could all learn from Michael Kamen&#8217;s feelings about whining and crying in this gig. Perhaps his sentiment can be summed up by an exhortation from a character in one of his most popular films. After Robin of Locksley launches into his warrior companion Azeem for choosing to meditate instead of help his new friend defend himself from a group of menacing marauders, Azeem observes, &#8220;You whine like a mule. You are <strong><em>still</em></strong> alive!”</p>
<p>Be thankful, be humble, be happy. You’ll be a better composer for it. The best way to “get the gig” is to first show up. The second best way is to show up with an infectiously positive attitude.</p>
<p>Start this new decade off right&#8230; and get one.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s something I thought would be an interesting exercise for us all. It&#8217;s something that I have been asking myself lately, as I navigate through my latest score project, and it&#8217;s something that I think you have to regularly ask yourself in order to stay fresh, although we probably don&#8217;t ask it enough.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a simple question.<em><strong> What makes you different?</strong></em></p>
<p>Tell me the <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">one</span></em> thing that you feel you do in your music that sets you apart from everyone else in the game. Be articulate. &#8220;I&#8217;m a good orchestrator&#8221; won&#8217;t cut it, and neither will &#8220;My music is melodic&#8221;. I got news for you: So is the music of about 800,000 others that work in film and TV. (Sorry to burst <em>that</em> little bubble!)</p>
<p>Be honest, be real, and be clear.</p>
<p><em><strong>What makes YOU different?</strong></em></p>
<p>Parcipation is simple too.<br />

<p><i>&#8220;There are two parts to creating. One is exploring and the other is culling. If you confuse them, then you won&#8217;t get anywhere. Mick Goodrick once said to me, &#8216;When you swim, there is stroking and then there&#8217;s gliding. And if you only stroke you won&#8217;t be able to swim, because you won&#8217;t get anywhere. You need to be able to glide in between strokes.&#8217; There&#8217;s a period of time when you are capturing the things floating around through you, and you have to be very careful not to be judgmental at that point. There is also the point when you need to be critical and throw things out, but if you go there at the wrong point in the process you&#8217;ll simply muck it up.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Here is a great video of Mirowitz talking to the New Mexico Film Commission last year. This is an amazing presentation about the conversation and process between the director and composer and how they wind up co-creating a cohesive film score. An extremely enlightening presentation, this video could be a masterclass in the director/composer relationship.<br />The entire series is about 90 minutes long, so when you have time, check it out.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is pretty daunting to look at the TV landscape and the people who are already involved with scoring for television and ask yourself: How in the hell am I ever going to get a shot? So many shows are in production, not to mention the fact that television is not just about the &#8220;regular season&#8221; anymore — it&#8217;s about a fragmented &#8220;season&#8221; that now runs year-round. The big networks are now starting to show the signs of a marathon runner trying desperately to keep up with the young bucks that are also on the course. These &#8220;youngins&#8221; are starting to become directly responsible for some of the best drama and comedy on television, with second and third-tier premium cable leading the pack with content that cannot be shown in a regular primetime slot.</p>
<p>With all of these variables at play in the current TV landscape, and given the fact that most people would still rather recline in the comfort of their own living room than brave cellphones, babies, and teenagers with laser pointers in a theater setting, TV is 2.0 these days.</p>
<p>As a film composer, you might be wondering how to tap into this luxurious stream, and how to start looking for TV gigs today in the crowded river of television composers?</p>
<p>Well&#8230; Not so fast. TV is pretty different from what you might be used to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#1) TV is <em>not</em> film.</h2>
<p><strong></strong>Scoring for television is nothing like scoring for film. Not in the least bit. There are some similarities, but not many. First, the schedules on television shows are insane. The hours you have to put in are completely inhumane. A typical season might stretch from September to May, literally with no break, and your weekly schedule often doesn&#8217;t allow for any downtime during score production. If you are used to hanging out with your family on weekends, keeping your composing time as &#8220;banker&#8217;s hours&#8221; during the week, you probably aren&#8217;t cut out for television. The truth hurts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#2) TV is <em>not</em> cheap.</h2>
<p><strong></strong>Television is very transparent. Because of the shorter runtimes that TV shows naturally have to cater to, music is often looked at to carry more of the story than it would during a 90-minute film. In addition, HD and <a class="zem_slink" title="Digital cable" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_cable" rel="wikipedia">digital cable</a> have upped the ante in regards to audio resolution, and now, even people with hearing issues can hear their favorite shows &#8211; and everything in them &#8211; better than they&#8217;ve ever have been able to before. Bottomline&#8230; your music has to be amazing. Television is no place to cut corners, skimp on audio quality, or rest on your laurels by using a quick and dirty methodology of loops and patches. You have to put time, attention, and detail into it or you are simply eventually going to get that call that nobody ever wants to get.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#3) TV is <em>not</em> for egomaniacs.</h2>
<p><strong></strong>Most of us are probably not at this level yet, but with film there comes a certain level of opinionated ego that you can get away with, and frankly, that most producers and directors who are worth their salt will even invite. After all, why would they have hired you in the first place if not for your musical opinion? Conversely, in television, you are rarely working with a director, as their job is finished once principal photography wraps. Instead, you are joined at the hip with either the producers or the &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" title="Show runner" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_runner" rel="wikipedia">showrunner</a>&#8221; — that person possibly being anyone that the producers deems responsible enough to handle the show and all of its components. There are bound to be lots of changes, suggestions, requests, demands, and mandates from the showrunner, because they are responsible to the studio to bring quality and consistency week after week. The pressure is really on them, therefore everyone on their team must perform at an optimum level. There is no room for you to allow your feelings to be hurt over someone on the creative team demanding that you make a change or rewrite a cue to fit the scene differently than you had first interpreted. The time constraints often do not allow for any other communication style other than directness, and you must have the kind of thick skin that can tolerate that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#4) TV is <em>not</em> for the uneducated.</h2>
<p><strong></strong>This last point is two-fold. The first part is appropriate for everyone working in TV or film, but I&#8217;ll relate it to TV in this way: If you want to work in television, you have to know what <span style="font-style: italic;">works</span> in television. If you have no idea what has come before you, how can you compete? A case could be made that you can be more original and have a fresher perspective if you are naive to what has been done before, therefore possessing zero knowledge of the limitations imposed by history. However, in television, some things just do <span style="font-style: italic;">not work</span>. Again, often because of the medium, if you think like a film composer while scoring a <a class="zem_slink" title="Television program" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_program" rel="wikipedia">TV show</a>, you are going to get yourself into some serious trouble at some point. Very often, motifs and themes that you would develop over time on a film will not work on a TV show because again&#8230; there isn&#8217;t enough time. Similarly, since you are working within an episodic framework, you have to remember that you are relatively blind to what is coming from week to week. Therefore, your anticipatory skills need to be razor sharp. I&#8217;m probably not being clear enough here, but there are just certain &#8220;rules&#8221; by which TV works. Breaking them is certain death, and any showrunner will agree.</p>
<p>The second part of my point here is that when I say &#8220;you cannot be uneducated if you want to work in TV&#8221;, I mean that you&#8230; wait for it&#8230; need to watch TV! If you aren&#8217;t a fan of TV or if you are one of those who hasn&#8217;t seen a dramatic television show since the 1960&#8217;s, forget it. You + TV writing = FAIL. Period. TV is a medium that has captivated audiences since 1929, so it has had a lot of practice at getting certain things right. If you do not watch TV, then you do not know what works on TV. TV has changed over the years, and you have to keep up on trends, current sounds, dramatic chops, just like film or video <a class="zem_slink" title="Video game" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game" rel="wikipedia">games</a> or any other medium that you might want to write for. Not everyone can cut the mustard in television. Many people try, and many people die. Be a fan, get on the bus, and start studying. There is no other way. Learn by immersion.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s the Point?</h2>
<p><strong></strong>I want to end this by telling you that my experience with all this is highly subjective. I have never scored a TV show in my life. On the other hand, I have been on teams that have scored <span style="font-style: italic;">plenty</span>. I&#8217;ve written additional music for TV and have had my music placed in dozens of primetime TV shows. I&#8217;ve seen it done over and over and over and over again as an assistant to several great TV writers. I&#8217;ve watched and I&#8217;ve learned so that when the time comes for me, I can have somewhat of an idea of what I should be doing. I know I&#8217;ll still be scared to death, but I will have the procedure down in a way that maybe others haven&#8217;t had the chance to observe. I hope that you get the same out of my little diatribe here.</p>
<p>Talk to me, SCOREcast! Let me know in the COMMENTS what you are thinking about this. Are you scared of TV? Are you excited to write for this medium? What about television seems foggy or unsure to you as you contemplate launching in? Let&#8217;s talk it out!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: inherit; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;">
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sig-ogden1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-672" title="sig-ogden" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sig-ogden1.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>On the heels of a killer column post from SCOREcast co-host Lee Sanders on Wednesday about &#8220;<a href="../../../2009/07/surviving-crunch.html">Surviving the Crunch</a>&#8220;, James Olszewski asked a very pertinent question:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote style="font-family: inherit;">
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: small;">What do you recommend to develop a passable roadmap on a compressed timeline?&#8230; I&#8217;d like to get a peek at what one of these roadmaps looks like (even if it&#8217;s just scribbles and random notes). Being the &#8220;planner&#8221; I am, I&#8217;m already thinking of some sort of template. Maybe something that takes you progressively from random notes to roadmap to spotting to cue sheet&#8230;. Does anything like that already exist?</span></p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">This is a great question, and one that could be met with as many different answers as there are composers that exercise this practice. In this post, I&#8217;m going to show you a handful of the things that I do in my work that help me achieve a cohesive plan when taking on a new set of visuals to score. Before I do that, though, let&#8217;s define a set of assumed parameters so that we can make sure we are all on the same page.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">I&#8217;m assuming that:</span></div>
<ol style="font-family: inherit;">
<li><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>You are *not* working with a <a class="zem_slink" title="Music editor (filmmaking)" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_editor_%28filmmaking%29">music editor</a>.</strong> A music editor, according to <a class="zem_slink" title="Fred Karlin" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Karlin">Fred Karlin</a>,  is the &#8220;person responsible for all physical details regarding the syncronization of the score with the picture.&#8221; In short, this person is usually involved from the outset of post-production and may be intimately involved with placing temp music into the film, recording and notating the spotting notes at a spotting session between you and the director, and finally, placing and syncronizing the recorded, mixed, and finalized score stems into the film itself for dubbing. Many of the duties handled by an independent film composer (one who is essentially doing it *all* on his/her own) would otherwise be handled by the music editor, thus taking some of the load off the shoulders of the composer and allowing him/her to focus solely on writing and recording the score.
<p></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>You don&#8217;t have a ton of time to write the score.</strong> It&#8217;s becoming pretty typical with any film, but almost certainly with an independent film, we as composers do not have a lot of time to do our jobs when the locked cut is finally handed over. There have even been times for me when I was already on the scoring stage on an indie film and here comes Mr. Director with a new cut that nobody but him and the editor knew about until&#8230; now.
<p></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>You don&#8217;t have a ton of money in the music budget.</strong> Duh! Helllooooo! Money in the post-production budget for music on an independent film? What in the hell is that?
<p></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>You have adequately immersed yourself in the material.</strong> As a competent composer, you have to develop the discipline of <em>getting under</em> the material so that you have a solid understanding of the story&#8217;s arc at a core level. Try for a second to understand the difference between &#8220;scoring <em>through</em> a film&#8221; versus simply &#8220;scoring a film&#8221;. There is a huge difference, and a lot of the difference comes from your ability to get the material into your headspace either through the script, the concept drawings or storyboards, or the locked cut. Bottom line: You must have enough of a love of the characters in your story to warrant you being trusted with them for this period of time. If you don&#8217;t care, your music will tattle on you — I promise!<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">So, assuming all of those — or at least one or two of them — are in place, here are some things I do when I am roadmapping a score to insure that I don&#8217;t get too far ahead of myself before realizing that I should have taken &#8220;that left toyn at Albuquerque.&#8221;</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>ORGANIZE YOUR LOGISTICS</strong><br />
Let&#8217;s first define what we are hired to do: <strong><em>Write music</em></strong>. That&#8217;s it. Nothing more, nothing less. We are the music people. However, we all know that there are way more things involved in scoring for a feature than just simply writing the music, don&#8217;t we? There are probably hundreds of little tiny nagging tasks that must be done daily in our studios in order than we might concentrate fully on writing score. I&#8217;m talking about phone calls, emails, notes, mailings, <a class="zem_slink" title="File Transfer Protocol" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">FTP</a> deliveries, invoicing, etc. Those all fall into what I would consider only one single set of administrative duties.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">The other set consists of things that are directly related to the main task of writing the music: Spotting the film; organizing spotting notes; keeping track of reel splits; scheduling live sessions; notating edit changes; interfacing with music editors, recording engineers, and mixers; and, last but certainly not least, keeping track of how much music you have left to write and how much time you have to write it in.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><em><strong>Cue Log Manager and Cue Chronicle</strong></em><br />
Luckily, there are a couple of killer software programs that can handle that entire last paragraph for you. The first one is a little number called <em><strong>Cue Log Manager (CLM)</strong></em>. CLM is a <a class="zem_slink" title="FileMaker" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileMaker">Filemaker Pro</a> database application that allows you to keep track of a film score, television score, or game score project from spotting to delivery. It was developed by Dino Herrmann and Daniel Hamuy, the team behind the popular &#8220;Powerkeys&#8221; DAW add-on.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: inherit; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"><a style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm12M4soB1I/AAAAAAAAAeE/NTPT2blbtBA/s1600-h/Picture+17.png"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm12M4soB1I/AAAAAAAAAeE/NTPT2blbtBA/s320/Picture+17.png" border="0" alt="" /></a></span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">I use CLM everyday in my studio and I like it for its clean layout, easy to understand functionality, and ability (through Filemaker) to put on a shared server and run with all of my workstations in my studio, enabling them to access to the most up-to-date info on where we are on projects. CLM features a simple layout which includes several &#8220;screensets&#8221; to work from, beginning with the Project Database. </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">The Project Database is an                  overall view of your project which enables you to track the status                  of each cue in the project. You can see if each cue has been composed,                  approved, orchestrated, recorded or which musician already recorded                  in each cue. </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">You can label your cues by usage, description, genre or style                  fields to help identify them within the project, and you can also </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">track                  multiple ensembles (orchestra, band, jazz trio, etc), as well as oversee </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">a detail view of what cues will be recorded                  in which session. The database will automatically calculate                  how many minutes of music need to be recorded per session, providing for you all of the information necessary to then organize the session more efficiently. CLM also allows                  for multiple sessions per day, as well as a great &#8220;Change                  Session Date&#8221; script that makes changing the date and time                  of a session and its related cues a snap.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><em>Cue Log Manager</em> also acts as a &#8220;Virtual Music Editor&#8221;, giving you the ability to </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">dynamically create Spotting Notes, Summary Sheets                  and Cue Sheets for your project as it evolves. The <em>spotting notes</em> feature displays start times, stop times,                  length, usage and a short description of each cue as well as length                  totals; the <em>summary sheet</em> option provides a quick overview of all                  the cues in a project and their length and usage; and the <em>cue list</em> page shows a list of each cue in a project with                  all the composer and publisher information as well as length and                  usage, serving as a worksheet for Performing                  Royalty Organizations (such as ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC) cue sheets.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><em>Cue Log Manager</em> is available for Apple computers running Filemaker Pro 8 or 9 in at least Mac OS 10.3.9. It retails online at the <a href="http://www.powerkeys.com/cuelogmanager.html">Powerkeys website</a> for $89 US.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><em><strong>Cue Chronicle</strong></em>, invented by Hollywood ProTools recordist Vincent Cirilli, is also worth taking a look at. <em>Cue Chronicle</em> differs greatly from Cue Log Manager in that it is offerred both as a Filemaker database and also as a standalone runtime application. It is also offers two unique and smart ways to license the application, which I&#8217;ll explain in a minute.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: inherit; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"><a style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm18IQ4vNkI/AAAAAAAAAeM/s0BjOd3lcT8/s1600-h/clistv3.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm18IQ4vNkI/AAAAAAAAAeM/s0BjOd3lcT8/s320/clistv3.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">Built certainly more with larger format studio scoring sessions in mind, </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><em>Cue Chronicle (CC)</em> is extensively more user definable than Cue Log Manager because of the way that Vinnie has created it. CC&#8217;s database is hugely modular which enables the entire app to function like a &#8220;central nervous system&#8221; for your scoring projects, including whole workspaces devoted soley to indivudual aspects of a scoring project like <em>crew</em>, <em>rigs</em>, <em>drives</em>, <em>reels</em>, <em>contacts</em>, and <em>notes</em>. The vast toolbox of checklists and itemizable charts include important variables such as version tracking, revision tracking, timing changes, takes, tracksheets for recording, and orchestral breakdown with a deep section allowing you to list and keep track of your instrumentation per cue. Everything is color-coded to make it easy to see and simple to monitor at quick glance, and with many fields user-definable, <em>Cue Chronicle</em> makes it pretty difficult to run out of ways to sort content.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">While Cue Log Manager utilizes a simple challenge and response licensing scheme, <em>Cue Chronicle</em> gives you a choice to tether your license to a particular machine in your studio OR tether the license to a USB memory stick enabling you to travel with the license and software from studio to studio, stage to stage. Pretty handy.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><em>Cue Chronicle</em> is available from <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/vcirilli/CueChronicle/index.html">Vincent Cirrilli&#8217;s website</a> and is downloadable for $295 US. It runs on Apple PPC or Intel computers running OS 10.4 and higher, and the optional Filemaker Pro v8 (v9 recommended).<br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>FINDING YOUR &#8220;SPOT&#8221;</strong><br />
When I was just getting started, the biggest problem I had with scoring a film from beginning to end was knowing where the best places were to put music. I was never quite sure early on if I was placing music in the film where the music should *really* be placed, or if I was just sort of guessing as best I could with no real idea of what I was doing. It took me awhile to get really great at spotting. The big problem for me was that I had a very difficult time seeing the entire score as a representative whole from top to bottom. When I would work, I would start writing whichever cue was calling me at the time, not really paying much attention to what I was doing in terms of continuity and sequence. At the end of writing the score, I would invariably end up forgetting something in the thrid or the fourth reel and then having to go back and write what I should have remembered to do while I was there the first time! It was very hard for me to see the overall &#8220;big picture&#8221; when I was needing to be so tunnel-visioned into what I was doing.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">If you have issues with not knowing whether or not you are covering everything you need to cover in your scores, or if you are having trouble spotting things on your own, let me offer this as a tip that might help get you thinking about how spotting can help you, and not scare you. You might have seen directors use this method that I am going to describe, but I learned it from an editor that I once worked with that has been using the method of storyboarding on <em><strong>Post-It Notes</strong></em> for the vast majority of his career.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">The idea of the <em>Post-It Note Score Storyboard</em> is to take a section of a wall in your writing room (as big a section as you can part with) and use it sort of as a big huge &#8220;map&#8221; for the storyline, characters, and arc of the film in relation to the musical cues that you will write to coalese with those points on your &#8220;map&#8221;. If you&#8217;ve ever watched or seen a director storyboard a camera shot, then you already know what I am talking about. Its not so much about storyboarding the musicality of a cue as much as it is about storyboarding the cue itself in the timeline of the film&#8217;s story arc.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">Start by taking a stack of standard canary yellow Post-It Notes and writing on each note a single event in the film that you feel is pivotal. &#8220;KISS&#8221; would be the key here: Keep It Simple! On one note you might write the words, &#8220;First Day/Harry Gets Up&#8221;. Another might say, &#8220;Car Won&#8217;t Start&#8221;. Yet another might say, &#8220;Julianne Misses Her Bus&#8221;. Be <em>specific</em> and be <em>generous</em> — you can always get rid of the events that you won&#8217;t write cues for, but once you have evrything up in the timeline, it will be hard to add events without moving all of the subsequent events down the line to compensate.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: inherit; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"><a style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm2HISzz2rI/AAAAAAAAAec/blm8YqBMJoU/s1600-h/warroom09.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm2HISzz2rI/AAAAAAAAAec/blm8YqBMJoU/s200/warroom09.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">Arrange these canary yellow &#8220;timeline&#8221; notes on the wall, left to right, in the sequence in which they occur as the film plays out. After you are finished, you should have a visual representation of the film&#8217;s timeline made up of yellow Post-It Notes.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">After you have the whole film represented with the canary yellow notes, take another stack of Post-Its that is a decidely different color from the yellow ones you just used to timeline the film. Maybe these are going to be Hot Pink. Designate these Hot Pink notes as the &#8220;cues&#8221; of your score. Take yet <em>another</em> set of a different color (green, orange, blue, purple&#8230; whatever floats your boat!) and make that your &#8220;Theme&#8221; color. Take a third set of a different color still and make these your &#8220;Motif&#8221; notes. You get the picture.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">Then, loosely decide (because I promise, you&#8217;ll change your mind about twenty million times!) where to put the hot pink CUE notes on the yellow timeline. Once that set has been exhausted, grab your THEME color and place those over the CUE notes where you think a main theme or character theme would be nice. After that, take you MOTIF color and place some of those over the THEME notes where you think your <em>Main Motif</em> might work nicley and communicate what&#8217;s happening in a scene. Pretty soon, after a lot of going back and forth, sticking and unsticking, moving and shuffling, you&#8217;ll have a fairly decent jumping-off point in which to begin scoring your new feature.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">Use this method to really experiment and try stuff you don&#8217;t think you should try! Often, those are the happiest of accidents and sometimes end up being the catalysts by which inspiration is born&#8230; and Oscars are awarded!</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">These are only a couple of ideas I have to get you thinking about your workflow and how maybe you can either make it more efficient (Cue Log Manager or Cue Chronicle) or dance outside the fire a bit with regards to how you plan your scores (Post-It Note spotting). I&#8217;d like to hear your ideas for mixing up your workflow in your studios and writing rooms&#8230;.</span></div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you ever wonder &#8220;why&#8221; a piece of music works in a scene? Does it just bug the ever-loving crap out you, like it does me, when you play your hard work for your director only to have him or her look at you blankly and utter the words &#8220;That just doesn&#8217;t work for me&#8221;?</p>
<p>I hate hearing those words come out of my director&#8217;s mouth. I want him or her to be pleased on first listen. Of course, it doesn&#8217;t always work that way and it is our job as the composer to find out why it doesn&#8217;t work that way. Music is so subjective and so personal that I often wonder privately things I&#8217;d never share with anyone, like &#8220;Who beat the hell out of this director so bad as a child to make him not like this cue for this scene?&#8221;</p>
<p>I have traversed far and wide to search out all possible answers to the question as to why, if you line five directors up against a wall and ask them to watch a scene with music, will you get five differing answers from each. This, of course, is an unanswerable question&#8230; perhaps answered only by discovering why *you* hear music the way you hear it and particularly why certain music, to your ears, would never fit in a certain scene.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all sat and listened to film scores independent of film to hear what others are doing or to study the greats and learn from them. The problem with that — and arguably, the problem with the concept of &#8220;film music critics&#8221; — is that the purpose and function of a piece of film music is essentially null and void when divorced from picture. With that rational, the very act of listening to a piece of film detached from the picture from whence it came is only half the story. It might be a nice listening experience, but you are still only getting part of the intended result.</p>
<p>I once dated a <a class="zem_slink" title="Costume designer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costume_designer" rel="wikipedia">costume designer</a>. Our lives were a whirlwind of film events, one after the other, hers then mine then hers then mine. Finally after awhile, our professional paths inevitably crossed and I was asked to score a film where she was also the principle wardrobe supervisor during production. It was an interesting experience seeing her styling and coloring choices explode onscreen while my music passed by in the underscore.</p>
<p>As creatives, costume designers and composers have similar workflows. When I am working on menial administrative tasks like cutting demos, returning emails, or prepping my assistant&#8217;s schedule for the next week, I listen to film scores via my iTunes library. But she preferred to watch DVDs with the volume turned <em>off</em>. I always found this incredibly interesting. Seems weird, until you remember that costume designers aren&#8217;t listening for score, FX, or dialog&#8230; they&#8217;re looking at <em>costumes</em>.</p>
<p>Over time, I&#8217;ve adopted many methods of looking at film from different people in other fields than mine, incorporating many of their routines into my way of working as a composer. What has resulted is a mash-up of looking at film and music in an effort to better understand why it is that music works why it is that sometimes it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Here is what it looks like: From time to time — and *only* with time to burn, mind you — I&#8217;ll put on an old movie or a recent release and turn the sound completely <em>off</em>. Then I&#8217;ll launch my iTunes library and set the filter controls so that only MY music shows up in the browser. As the film plays, I&#8217;ll &#8220;temp&#8221; my music into the film by simply pushing &#8220;PLAY&#8221; when a scene comes up that I feel needs music. I&#8217;ll experiment — I&#8217;ll put things in that I think would fit well, or put things in that are completely from another genre just to see what works and what&#8230; um&#8230; doesn&#8217;t. (Imagine &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" title="Seven (film)" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt114369/" rel="imdb">SE7EN</a>&#8221; with tunes from that <em>sports comedy</em> you just finished!)</p>
<p>This process teaches me a TON. Not only do I learn what not to do, but I have also learned that in film music, and filmmaking in general, there are *no* rules. Everything is on the table. Therefore, sometimes, a serious scene works better with a comedic score or a slightly quirkier feel to the music. Conversely, we&#8217;ve all seen many great film composer legends play against comedy with a serious tone in the accompanying score.</p>
<p>Playing around with these kinds of things really enables you to learn &#8220;privately&#8221; and make mistakes on your own dime that canand should NEVER be made on your director&#8217;s.</p>
<p>This is one small, and maybe silly, way to &#8220;think&#8221; about how film music works and how it won&#8217;t&#8230; but it <em>&#8220;works for me&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p>What works for you?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/sig-sanders2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-694" title="sig-sanders" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/sig-sanders2.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>A beginning is a delicate time… or so I&#8217;ve heard. So I want to begin my column here on SCOREcast with what I&#8217;m going to try to cover—which is nearly everything—and a few words about my plan of attack.</p>
<p>I like to work &#8220;big to small.&#8221; In other words, I try to start with the overarching concept, and then work out the details as I go. That way, if I&#8217;ve omitted anything, you have the larger context, and can figure out the details yourself. If you&#8217;re cool with that, read on…</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s Big Picture has to do with self-assessment, and it&#8217;s a metaphor from (American) football: coaches talk about their teams&#8217; performance in terms of <span style="font-style: italic;">phases of the game</span>. In football, the three phases are offense, defense and special teams (like kicking field goals or returning punts).</p>
<p>A coach might say: &#8220;We dominated the offensive phase of the game today. But we got beat on special teams, and those twelve field goals (!) they scored really hurt us.&#8221; What he&#8217;s saying is that his team had a critical <span style="font-style: italic;">imbalance</span>—one facet of their performance wasn&#8217;t up to standard. And the team&#8217;s overall game suffered as a result.</p>
<p>Football teams that excel in one phase of the game can win individual contests; they might even beat a particular opponent regularly (they &#8220;match up well&#8221; against a certain defense, e.g.). Teams that are strong in every phase of the game, though… those teams have the potential to become legend.</p>
<p>So it is with us as composers. We&#8217;re talking about diversity this month, and I think a good way to approach this topic is to look at our own diversity. What are we great at? Where do our skills fall down? How can we target our efforts to improve?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Here&#8217;s a little quiz:</span> rate yourself from one to five in each area. A one indicates little or no experience; a five is world-class mastery. Be honest—no one&#8217;s looking at this but you. I&#8217;ve picked areas that I&#8217;ve found to be important in my own career; your mileage may vary, but I doubt it&#8217;ll vary by much.</p>
<p>Some of the &#8220;phases of the game&#8221; I&#8217;m including below are crucial; others are merely <span style="font-style: italic;">important</span> from time to time or if you&#8217;re wanting to break into a certain area of the biz. The quiz is primarily aimed at composers, though many of the topics apply to anyone in our crazy little corner of the music world.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve taken the quiz, rate yourself. You&#8217;ve created a snapshot of your skill set—and now you can analyze that data. What does the graph of your skill set look like? How would you like it to look in six months… a year… five years? What&#8217;s the best way to get there?</p>
<p>You may decide to play to your strengths by beefing up the phases in which you&#8217;re already strong… or shore up those phases where you aren&#8217;t. That&#8217;s up to you. I hope this tool will be valuable, though, no matter where you find yourself in your career.</p>

3. People say I&#8217;m a good hang… and it doesn&#8217;t mean they want to hang me.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of the time when talking about the topic of &#8220;diversification&#8221; as film composers, we are referring to the skills necessary to write for a variety of different mediums, genres, or projects. I&#8217;d like to talk about diversifying in a different light &#8211; being a diverse <span style="font-style: italic;">collaborator</span>.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Diverse collaboration</span> to me means that in this process of filmmaking you are a <span style="font-style: italic;">solution</span>, not a <span style="font-style: italic;">problem</span>. It means possessing the skillset to creatively and intuitively behave your team <span style="font-style: italic;">out</span> of the tight spots that others might have behaved your team <span style="font-style: italic;">in</span> to. It doesn&#8217;t just mean that you can write great music for any number of situations or scenes, but also that you are solid in a room, you know how to treat people, you know your gear, and that you follow through on tasks delegated to you. In fact, your diversity as a collaborator might be one of the greatest assets you can provide a director who has hired you to score his or her film.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not always easy – diversity and flexibility as a collaborator can be tough. You have to be on your toes as much as on your guard. In the post-production process, schedules are tight and claustrophobic which tends to create tension and sometimes friction amongst those being held responsible to pull off a miracle at the eleventh hour. I have found that in times like these, when directors are almost always already on the edge of insanity, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Whatever you can do at this point insure a smoother ride for them, do <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span>.</p>
<p>There are some simple work habits that have helped me collaborate well with people over the years. Each of these suggestions are basic yet important fundamentals that I&#8217;ve held fast to and tried not to deviate from. This list is itself a diverse one – some of these ideas are technical, while others are philosophical in nature. Each of them, however, has played an important role in my business, guarantying a smooth working collaboration every time.</p>
<p>In this, my first &#8220;Tao&#8221; column, I&#8217;ll attempt to define some of them, and then I wanna hear yours!</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">NEVER play a director a cue that you don&#8217;t really love.</span><br />
These are in no particular order, but this might be the most important one in the bunch. I&#8217;ve done it both ways in my career- I&#8217;ve submitted something I thought was absolutely perfect for the scene, and then on one particular occasion, I thought I&#8217;d be &#8220;smart&#8221; and submit two things: one that I thought was perfect, and one that I thought was lame and would most assuredly guarantee that the director choose the first one. Yep&#8230;you guessed it. The director chose the lame one, and I was forced to run with it. Now every time I hear that cue in that particular movie, I cringe. NEVER ever ever ever play the director a cue that you aren&#8217;t 200% in love with.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Demo in as much detail as possible.</span><br />
&#8220;The more you show, the more you&#8217;ll know.&#8221; – Christopher Young.<br />
Directors don&#8217;t speak &#8220;music&#8221;. It is up to you to utilize your mock-ups to determine what it is that they like about what they are hearing, as much as what they don&#8217;t like about it. Ask a lot of questions. Upon them saying, &#8220;Yeah, that just doesn&#8217;t work for me&#8221;, find out &#8220;Why&#8221;. Is it an instrument they don&#8217;t like, or an entire melody line? The former is easy to fix, the latter&#8230; not so much. More often than not, less is more in a film score so the more color you add to your mock-ups (assuming your thematic material has already been approved), the more opportunity there is to strip away layers until they finally hear what they like.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Save EVERY version of EVERY cue.</span><br />
I&#8217;ll never forget one time while working on a pivotal cue for an action scene, I saved what I thought was the best version of the cue that I had come up with yet. The problem was that I saved it over the top of the prior version. But that&#8217;s okay, cuz this one was better, right?! I played the cue for the director, and he confirmed what I had told myself would never happen in a million years: &#8220;Yeah that&#8217;s cool, but I liked the last one better! It had something this one doesn&#8217;t.&#8221; FRICK! Moral of the story? Save every damn thing you do. You never know what is going to catch their ear and what isn&#8217;t, even if you think you know.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Find out who the boss is, and deal only with them.</span><br />
Never accept a job where a committee of 10 people must approve each cue revision. You&#8217;ll end up taking a great score and turning it into a giant pile of crap trying to please a committee. If I&#8217;ve said it once, I&#8217;ve said it a thousand times: &#8220;Approval by committee never ever works!&#8221; Find out who the decision maker is and work ONLY with them. If there is no single decision maker (Hint: its usually the director), then don&#8217;t accept the job. You&#8217;ll thank yourself for it later. That said, there are exceptions to every rule. On &#8220;The Way Home&#8221;, I had two decision makers – the director AND the producer – but they functioned as one. If one of them approved something, it was understood by all that I had my &#8220;final approval&#8221;. This worked flawlessly, and given the time pressure of our deadline, it HAD to.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Triple check your mixes against dialog and FX.</span><br />
You aren&#8217;t the only contractor working on the project at this stage in the game. Make sure you are communicating with all department heads, ie. mix engineer, lead foley artist, dialog editors, etc. Check your mixes against the scenes &#8211; never skip this step, even if you are in a rush. There&#8217;s nothing worse than getting to a dub and having to concede that your music be buried in the mix because it conflicts with more important elements in the film. And remember &#8211; Dialog will take priority every time. No exceptions. Never try to compete with it. You&#8217;ll simply lose that battle.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Give the film YOUR voice. Try to avoid trends and gimmicks.<br />
</span> An original score is a huge investment in trust and belief in you by your employers. Creating a trendy/gimmicky score will result in it sounding outdated and cheap in two years. Your director/producers deserve more and have paid the price to bring you in. Don&#8217;t skimp by simply stringing something together using the latest loops and plugins that every single other composer is using. Be original and come up with something that will &#8220;brand&#8221; their movie in people&#8217;s ears and minds, and never ever be afraid to inject your personality into your scores. After all, they hired YOU for a reason.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Create simple motifs and themes.</span><br />
Don&#8217;t get too complex with your themes and motifs. Don&#8217;t use more than two or three themes or two or three motifs to identify those themes. Even the heaviest symphonic scores are simple in their effectiveness. John Williams is the obvious master of this tactic. Listen to how he brilliantly reuses motivic ideas throughout his entire score, never deviating far from the original theme or idea. A score that is too complex serves to do nothing but dilute the storyline and take the viewers attention off of where it should be.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Create &#8220;threads&#8221;.</span><br />
Building on my last point, I like to think of the score as a big quilt that wraps itself around a film. The &#8220;quilt&#8221; (score) is made up of dozens of &#8220;blocks&#8221; (cues) and each block has within it several &#8220;threads&#8221; that associate each block with the rest of the quilt. Once you have a theme that supports the film well, check to see if there&#8217;s a way to use only one line of the theme in other themes to help &#8220;thread&#8221; the score together. In your film score, there are all kinds of ways to &#8220;state a theme&#8221; without really stating it within the context of its original useage. Additionally, the &#8220;thread&#8221; can also be the use of some sort of instrument that lends identity to the score. Think of what Mark Isham did in &#8220;Crash&#8221; with a female solo voice juxtaposed against a thick liquidy wash of synthesizers. &#8220;Threads&#8221; are everything in helping to give the film a musical identity.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Think big.</span><br />
As an independent film composer, by the time the producers are ready for your music, there is not much room left in the budget. Yet, the everyone has met and its unanimous: Real instruments &#8211; maybe even a large orchestra &#8220;would sound amazing on this film!&#8221; Well, yes, that might be true, but the reality is that you can&#8217;t get something for nothing. Or can you? Online networking has opened up so many more possibilities that weren&#8217;t there even a year ago, and the reality is that in today&#8217;s technological age, it IS possible to get together a group of people who would love nothing more than to get their names on something that Hollywood is up to. So think big. Don&#8217;t let the &#8220;budget&#8221; paint you into a corner that really doesn&#8217;t exist. Many times I&#8217;ve recorded a decent orchestra on a shoe-string budget for a film that, in my opinion as the composer, really needed an orchestral sound. It is always worth turning over every rock and calling in every marker to get something bigger than everyone thinks is even possible when people are looking to you to deliver something amazing. So, go on, be the hero and save the day! You&#8217;ll get hired again by giving more than you are being asked to give. Everyone wants someone like that on their team.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Over Communicate.</span><br />
Okay&#8230; forget #1! THIS might be the most important one of the bunch! Dale Carnegie said, &#8220;The worst thing you can do in business is leave people to their own wondering.&#8221; So true. You can never communicate too much. It&#8217;s impossible. Find out how your client likes to communicate, whether by email, phone, fax, iChat, whatever&#8230; and DO IT TO DEATH! Tell them everytime you revise something, rewrite something, notice something in the picture that you didn&#8217;t notice before&#8230; anything to help them understand that you are working hard for them and doing what they&#8217;ve asked you to do (and sometimes what they HAVEN&#8217;T asked you to do!). NEVER let your creative team not hear from you in days. That&#8217;s the cardinal sin. The score is likely the first time that the creative team has let go of the project to an outside independent creative talent like yourself, and they need reassurance that you are not killing the &#8220;baby&#8221; they just spent the last two years of their life carrying.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes, part of being <span style="font-style: italic;">diverse</span> means being flexible and ready to do whatever it takes. The job of a film composer is one of service to the director and service to the film itself. We cannot afford to be unbendable or unteachable in our careers. Being diverse in how you handle situations and flexible in how you handle stress and obstacles is vital to your success in this business. Some of it will come with time and learning the hard way, but most of it can come with common sense and solid planning.</p>
<p>This is <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">my</span> list &#8211; if you have a few of your own, I&#8217;d love to hear them!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/sig-knaub.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-696" title="sig-knaub" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/sig-knaub.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>Every month I will be talking about the technology that we work with on a day to day basis as well as some tips on how to make your experience writing and composing music as easy as possible without letting the technology get in the way.</p>
<p>These techno toys we deal with can be very intimidating at times. Some of us are just not that technical and we don’t want to be, while others love combing through the manual and look forward to the challenges of taking on a new piece of gear. (In a future issue we will talk about GAS (Gear Acquisition Syndrome).</p>
<p>So what exactly do we have to deal with in our studios on a daily basis? Computers, mixing consoles, DAW controllers, audio interfaces, microphones, patch bays, word clock generators, stereo recorders, MIDI interfaces, MIDI sound modules, and not to mention all the different pieces of software you may use. And, let’s not forget our countless connections: Analog, Digital, MIDI, Ethernet, Video, Internet, etc. If you’re Deane, you probably have a fiber optic cable connected to your forehead as well.</p>
<p>When you sit down with pencil and paper, notation software, or your DAW, you want to turn on your right brain and go to it without thinking “is this hooked up correctly, how come I can’t hear the percussion tracks, and why are the lights dimming around my neighborhood.” (Unless, that is your mood lighting.)</p>
<p>Joe Trapanese mentions in his <a href="../../../2009/06/composer-as-producer-maximizing-your.html">column</a> that using templates is key to kicking your project off on the right foot. I have to agree that these are probably one of the most significant timesavers and methods to improve your creative muse.</p>
<p>So let’s talk specifically about the template in your sequencer or DAW. This template is really nothing more than a blank session that you have pre-configured to have all of your tracks/channels, routing, groupings, stems, and effects laid out in a way that makes your workflow smooth. Some composers use predominantly MIDI tracks and few audio tracks, while others use more audio tracks than MIDI. I have composer friends who may have separate tracks for every piece of the orchestra, percussion, and separate drum tracks. This can easily put you over 100 tracks. Do you need just a few key orchestral instruments? Are you composing with guitar and perhaps need 4-6 audio tracks as well? These are some of the questions to ask. How do I work best? What is the end result? A full mockup score to be redone later on during the scoring stage, or is this a lower budget piece that will use everything as played in your DAW. Whatever your result, start by adding these tracks to your blank template.</p>
<p>Before you do this, I recommend you sit down and spend a few hours or more laying out how you typically score and what are the technical logistics of your studio.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
Start with a list like this:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Small Orchestral Pop Template</span></p>
<p>* 5 external MIDI modules with stereo outputs using 2 MIDI channels on each module<br />
* One GigaSampler with 16 MIDI and16 digital audio outputs via ADAT<br />
* 10 internal Soft synths fed to outputs 1-4 on audio interface<br />
* 8 audio channels in DAW for loops, FX, etc.<br />
* All audio outputs run to external mixer<br />
* Mixer control levels and control room monitoring<br />
* Mixer feeds DAW inputs 1-2 for mixdown</p>
<p>A list similar to this can help you visualize exactly what you have and how things need to be connected and laid out in your DAW. Remember, the goal is to make things easy and simplistic.</p>
<p>From here, start to build out your template by adding tracks and testing them. Make sure your MIDI routing is correct and that you can hear the correct synths, soft synths, etc. If you are using a more complex setup, i.e. multiple computers and MIDI over LAN, these things take time to set up and trouble shoot if you encounter problems. So again, give yourself some time to be able to work out the kinks. You’re a composer – you don’t care that you may need an Ethernet crossover cable instead of a straight through, but your gear does.</p>
<p>Make sure to save your template after every modification.</p>
<p>If you’re using a soft sampler, make sure you have the instances loaded and a stereo or multiple output version configured. If you are pre-loading samples, then load them to their associated channels and test the MIDI and audio routing. (In a future issue we will talk about getting samplers to run outside of your DAW and the 32-bit memory limitation.)</p>
<p>If you are using any type of stems or sub groups, get those added in, and make sure your internal audio buses are working correctly. (Tip: Use a pre-recorded audio test tone on your tracks (audio) to test the audio outputs as well as aux and group busing.)</p>
<p>Add any internal or even external effects to your aux sends, individual tracks, groups, etc.</p>
<p>So we have our template saved with all of our tracks, groups, synths, samplers and effects. One last and very important thing we need to do is validate that your CPU is worthy of your template. One thing I like to do as a test is, using a stopwatch, time how long the template takes to open. If you have many soft samplers in your template and they are loading samples, this could take a while depending on your drive speed and whether you’re using RAID or not. This seems trivial but is actually quite useful if you know it takes 3 minutes to open, you could go get a cup of coffee or a glass of wine, while you’re waiting. This time is also important to know if you have to make any changes to the audio system settings. In Digital Performer for example, every time you open and close the audio driver settings, or change the buffer size, DP must reload the entire contents of the project, so count on another 3 minutes. This can definitely steal your Mojo. This I know first hand as I am currently in DP therapy for cursing at the computer screen during this time.</p>
<p>Record some MIDI and audio data to make sure the CPU can handle all you’ve just asked it to. You may have to change your buffer while recording and again during playback based on the speed of your system, at which point you can join me in therapy. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>So once we have our template finalized and working, we can now start writing that award winning Opus without the gear potentially getting in the way and blaming your soft synth for ruining your Oscar nomination.</p>
<p>Now some of you might be thinking about our good friend Murphy, and saying sometimes he likes to visit at the worst of times. Well, my fellow SCOREcasters, I can&#8217;t save you from Mr. Murphy, but I can tell you that by going through this exercise of building your template you’ll have a better understanding of how things are connected. You’ll have documentation and maybe even some type of drawing showing your connections. In the end, this should help you, if….. sorry I meant when you need to troubleshoot your studio setup.</p>
<p>Share with us tips on your templates.</p>
<p>Until next time, happy composing.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/sig-ogden2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-700" title="sig-ogden" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/sig-ogden2.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>I&#8217;ve been on my back for the last 24 hours with the flu. I don&#8217;t know how I got it, except to say that lately I&#8217;ve been running pretty hard on very little rest, and so I think it was just my turn.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re sick you can&#8217;t do much, which is a real pain in the ass for guys like me who hard time sitting still for five minutes. I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s God&#8217;s way of telling me that I need to take a break. Today, I got that chance, and it provided me with an opportunity to share something with all of you that I thought was pretty cool.</p>
<p>In one of my many neglected industry mags that I&#8217;ve let stack up by the front door over the last several weeks, I read an interview with James Cameron about his forthcoming highly anticipated film &#8220;Avatar&#8221;. He doesn&#8217;t spill any beans about the movie for u<span style="font-style: italic;">s </span>Sci-Fi geeks that have been waiting for a good four years, but he says some pretty cool things in the interview about his film making process.</p>
<p>After a bunch of stuff about how Cameron got into movies, what it was like working for Roger Corman, and how he talked the studio into letting him finish &#8220;Titanic&#8221;, the interviewer asked him, &#8220;Why do you think you&#8217;ve been so lucky as a filmmaker?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cameron gave this as his answer:</p>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic;"><p>&#8220;Luck? Look, when I was 10 years old, I knew I wanted to do this for a living. When I started in Hollywood, yes, I got some breaks, but those breaks were opportunities born out of sheer preparedness and hand-to-the-plow work ethic. I&#8217;ve had some crazy ideas, and thanks to those ideas everything I&#8217;ve ever accomplished has come about because I literally talked the decision-makers into liking my idea. Nobody has ever wanted to <span>give</span> me anything until I convinced them to. If you want to succeed in this industry, or any industry for that matter, you have to work like you have no other choice but to succeed. Luck has nothing to do with it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Some people might read Cameron&#8217;s words and dismiss them as more rhetoric from someone already accused on several occasions of being an egomaniac. But when I read this, I smiled.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s right. I don&#8217;t believe in the concept of a &#8220;self-made&#8221; man &#8211; everyone has had help at one point or another. However, there is a notion Cameron is speaking about here that I&#8217;ve heard before and completely agree with: Opportunities are not given, they are <span style="font-style: italic;">taken</span>. When someone gives you a shot at something, the execution of the opportunity lives or dies with <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">you</span>. If you don&#8217;t have the skills to pay the bills, what good is an opportunity from someone in the first place?</p>
<p>The first job I had in the industry writing original music was for Monday Night Football at ABC Sports. I was scared out of my mind, and my first couple of weeks on the show consisted of days of pure joy punctuated by moments of sheer terror. In my heart I knew I could do it, but my head daily told me otherwise. I made a lot of mistakes working on that show, but I learned from them quickly. In hindsight, however, I would have made many greater mistakes had I not prepared myself for the day when someone said, &#8220;You&#8217;re up, kiddo!&#8221;</p>
<p>Before Monday Night Football, I had zero experience with television schedules, broadcasting formats, and delivery specifications. But what I <span style="font-style: italic;">did</span> have were the scoring chops and production skills necessary to sustain writing 41 minutes of music every week for four months straight with no break in the schedule. Those skills did not come about through osmosis; they came about through years of musically training myself like a marathon runner so that when it came time for me to take the baton I could hit the ground running and never look back. In my experience, the anticipation of opportunity plus preparation, knowledge, and a certain amount of wild-eyed craziness was the recipe for success.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">You</span> are the only one who can guarantee your own success at this. With preparation and work ethic you will make it in this business. But it&#8217;s all on <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">you</span>. <span style="font-style: italic;">Luck</span> has nothing to do with it.</p>

I also agree that procrastination is erroneously looked upon as a negative thing nearly all the time.</p>
<p>Even under the most common definitions I&#8217;m not too terribly guilty of procrastination or &#8220;wasting time.&#8221; That doesn&#8217;t mean I push things off or delay starts or anything like that. In fact, procrastination for me is a major step in the creative process. It&#8217;s the moment to cleanse the palette and purge the creative process of any undesirables. It&#8217;s a moment for planning and just keeping things fun. Eventually when the that phase is over you&#8217;ll need to make that transition effectively or else risk losing valuable time in your schedule. That is when procrastination <span style="font-style: italic;">does</span> become a liability.</p>
<p>Even working with Deane on his latest project the fact we had to pull an all-nighter to get the scores and parts done before an 11AM recording session wasn&#8217;t that big of a deal for me. My wife knows, my kids know, my friends know&#8230;when it&#8217;s deadline time they won&#8217;t see me and I&#8217;m probably not sleeping. That&#8217;s just a fact of the business. There&#8217;s no such thing as finishing early. In fact, there is the old saying &#8220;you never really finish you just run out of time.&#8221; That&#8217;s pretty much true.</p>
<p>Even though I may spend a week or ten days &#8220;procrastinating&#8221; on a big scoring project I look back when it&#8217;s all said and done and realize that planned time at the start of production was essential to me reaching the finish line. I feel like I maximized my time on nearly everything I&#8217;ve done. That&#8217;s just the way the old ball bounces.</p>
<p>Good topic Deane&#8230;</p>

The issue of procrastination is a tough topic, and probably one of the top five things we music people do not like to talk about.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/05/sig-ogden.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-707" title="sig-ogden" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/05/sig-ogden.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>PROCRASTINATION</span>:</p>
<div style="text-align: left;">A behavior which is characterized by deferment of actions or tasks to a later time.</div>
<p>The issue of procrastination is a tough topic, and probably one of the top five things we music people do not like to talk about. However, if we are honest with ourselves, the question is not &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">Do</span> you procrastinate?&#8221; as much as it is &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">How</span> do you procrastinate?&#8221;</p>
<p>While most of the world would view procrastination as a negative, sometimes it can be a very useful tool to accomplish perfect work. A guest lecturer I once had at USC said that his version of procrastination was to keep his sketches from a certain orchestrator until the very night before a session. He found that the orchestrator&#8217;s initial instincts were often dead-on accurate, and over the years he&#8217;d realized that leaving the orchestrator with the music for too long would impair his otherwise perfect choices for the orchestra.</p>
<p>I think all too often, the world defines &#8220;procrastination&#8221; as a negative characteristic in people, which is not necessarily the correct definition of the word. Procrastination can be <span style="font-style: italic;">positive</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">negative</span>. But the real meat and potatoes of this discussion comes down to one simple word: <span style="font-style: italic;">planning</span>. Procrastination is all about planning. Procrastination can be a useful tool, but you have to plan for it.</p>
<p>In my career as a composer, I utilize the method of <span style="font-style: italic;">planned procrastination</span> all of the time. There are certain things that I simply do better when under pressure, and since I know that about myself, I allow for it in the schedule. I tend to keep pretty organized during a project and have key methods for staying on-task during a harsh deadline. I carefully plot out all of the steps necessary to deliver my score on-time and on-budget, and that includes the things I know I will put off until the last minute.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&#8217;t mean that things aren&#8217;t stressful during deadline week (just ask <a href="http://scorecastportal.blogspot.com/search/label/BMS">Brian Satterwhite</a> about this, who learned of my planned procrastination on a recent project we did together!) During deadline week, there is just a perfect storm always brewing and you often become a fireman instead of a composer. You can still, however, allow in your planned schedule for these types of fires to be started as well as adequate time for them to be put out.</p>
<p>In our business, you are in a position to write a certain number of minutes of music per day, and falling behind on that means that you will be in big trouble down the line. EVERYTHING must be planned for in a film music schedule.</p>
<p>For example, many of us on the SCOREcast Core Team are passionate about mentoring others in our industry. Joe Trapanese and Lee Sanders both are involved in teaching courses on film music and music production at universities here in Los Angeles. Brian Satterwhite hosts a great radio show in Austin and promotes film music publically as a contributor to many popular online publications. For all of us, helping others is important, but it requires extreme planning. I am a very generous person by nature, but I know myself: I&#8217;ll give away the farm and not have any hens left to feed my own family with. I do not have the time, financial bandwidth, and overall resources to be generous to everyone all of the time, so I have to <span style="font-style: italic;">plan</span> for it. I simply know to &#8220;X&#8221; out a couple of days a month where my whole day will just be spent doing nothing but helping someone else. When planning out my financial budget for each month, I know to &#8220;X&#8221; out a certain number of dollars that are just going to go to someone else who needs them worse than I do. And the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>So, SCOREcasters, I ask you: What do you need to plan for? Usually, it will be a weakness about you that requires extra planning for. Sometimes, it is a positive thing that you do as a person that requires the extra planning. The point is, there are only so many hours in a day, and each hour given to you is one during which you should ultimately be writing music for your deadline. Do you wait until the last minute to work on important tasks, or do the tasks which most people deem important not fall so closely to the line on your list of priorities? Do you do the hard things first and the easier things last, or vice-versa? Do you give time in your schedule for unexpected phone calls, daily office interuptions, and children blasting through your studio doors after a long school day?</p>
<p>Talk to me.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/05/sig-well1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-731" title="sig-well" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/05/sig-well1.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>You see what film composers do.  &#8220;That&#8217;s what <span style="font-style: italic;">I</span> want!&#8221;, you say.   But how to begin?</p>
<p>If this resonates for you, start by trying to figure out how you&#8217;ll measure <span style="font-style: italic;">success</span>.  What is it that you <span style="font-style: italic;">really </span>want?  And what&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">good</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">enough </span>to keep you happy?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll go first.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Ahem &#8230; </span>Let it be known that I, unlike many of my SCOREcast colleagues, am <span style="font-style: italic;">not </span>already successful in this business (yet!).  And I&#8217;m still working on answering the above questions for myself.  So you&#8217;re watching <span style="font-style: italic;">my </span>career unfold (<span style="font-style: italic;">very </span>slowly), in real time!  Your results may differ &#8230;</p>
<p>In my own case &#8211; and specifically in the context of creating music for film and other media &#8211; I think success will have three components:</p>
<p>(1) being <span style="font-style: italic;">in business</span> for myself, meaningfully satisfying real needs of real customers;</p>
<p>(2) earning enough with my business to enable me to <span style="font-style: italic;">keep </span>doing it &#8211; at least most of the time;</p>
<p>(3) working in a way that&#8217;s consistent with my chosen car-free, low-travel lifestyle &#8211; and living where I live now (which <span style="font-style: italic;">ain&#8217;t</span> in LA).</p>
<p>Maybe you&#8217;re thinking, <span style="font-style: italic;">that&#8217;s pretty broad</span> &#8211; except maybe #3.  Hm.  It doesn&#8217;t say anything like, &#8220;Scoring for Hollywood blockbusters.&#8221;</p>
<p>That <span style="font-style: italic;">would </span>be cool!  If that&#8217;s what <span style="font-style: italic;">you </span>really want and need, put it in <span style="font-style: italic;">your </span>list, and I&#8217;ll watch <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span>!  But I don&#8217;t need to be in the big time as much as I need (1), (2), and (3) &#8211; so for now, I&#8217;ll stick with what I&#8217;ve written.</p>
<p>Your turn.</p>

Sure, it cuts a few precious syllables out of conversations… but air is cheap. So what gives?</p>
<p>I think it has to do with the feeling of being &#8220;in the loop&#8221;—that secure, clubby vibe that comes from knowing we&#8217;re among geeks of a similar stripe. TLAs and their ilk are like secret handshakes. They&#8217;re the modern-day shibboleths by which we identify our own.</p>
<p>So here are a few &#8220;secret handshakes&#8221; you&#8217;ll hear in the studio, in the editing bay and on the scoring stage.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>ADR: </span>Automated Dialog Recording (or Automatic Dialog Replacement, or one of any number of similar meanings—!). The exact meaning of the abbreviation, believe it or not, is a point of controversy in the Industry. What is agreed on is what ADR is: it&#8217;s the replacement (in post-production) of poorly recorded or performed bits of dialog or location sound. Also called <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">looping</span>.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>ASCAP</span>, <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">BMI</span>, <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">SESAC</span>: Only one of these is a true TLA (the other two are acronyms). All three are <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">PRO</span>s (see below).<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>DGA</span>: Directors Guild of America. The union for film and television directors.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>DP</span>: Director of Photography (a.k.a. cinematographer). And, of course, <a href="http://www.motu.com/products/software/dp/">Digital Performer</a>.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>EDL</span>: Edit Decision List. This is a file generated by computer-based video editing systems, containing information about all the cuts, fades, timecode locations, etc. that constitute the edit.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>FCP</span>: Final Cut Pro. Apple&#8217;s pro-level video-editing software (even though it&#8217;s now officially titled <a href="http://www.apple.com/finalcutstudio/">Final Cut Studio</a>).<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>IATSE</span>: The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees. The IATSE union represents a wide variety of people involved in the making of films: from set decorators to costumers, from grips to lighting to first aid.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>M&amp;E</span>: Music and Effects. You&#8217;ll often hear this term used when a producer is talking about foreign versions of a particular picture—even though they may be dubbing (i.e., replacing) the dialog, they don&#8217;t want to re-do their entire project mix, so they&#8217;ll create a submix containing only the music and effects… hence, M&amp;E.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>MOS</span>: Mit Out Sound. Here&#8217;s a wacky one for you. MOS derives from an old Hollywood tale about a German director asking for a scene to be shot &#8220;mit out sound,&#8221; and a snarky camera assistant who wrote M.O.S. on the slate. The name stuck. (Sound is, of course, added later.)<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>NDA</span>: Non-disclosure agreement. Depending on the type of show you&#8217;re working on, you might be asked to sign one of these confidentiality documents. You&#8217;re basically promising not to tell who wins the reality-show competition, which main character dies in the season finale, or any other privileged information. Penalties threatened by NDAs can run into the millions of dollars.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>OMF</span>: Open Media Framework. A data standard used by AVID editing systems, OMFs are typically used to transfer audio information from AVIDs to Pro Tools setups for mixing.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>OMG</span>: What you text your friends when you pick up a network series or studio picture.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>PRO</span>: Performing Rights Organization. These are the fine folks who collect and distribute royalties to composers, songwriters, lyricists, etc. Of course, they do much more than that… but it is tough to read beyond the magic word: <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">royalties</span>.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>SMPTE</span>: Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. In our world this is usually shorthand for the timecode found on work prints, but the abbreviation refers to the organization that developed the standard.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>UPM</span>: Unit Production Manager. An executive responsible for the administration of a given film (particularly budgetary expenditures associated with the production phase of filmmaking—the UPM delivers the working budget, for example, to the financiers). UPMs are part of the <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">DGA</span> (see above) union.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>WGA</span>: Writers Guild of America. The union for professional writers (particularly screenwriters). Two branches here: East and West. Unlike the music scene, no lethal rivalry is known to exist between WGAw and WGAe writers.</p>

<p>My big audacious goal was to stay up last night to watch this happen in real time, but I fell asleep like a loser and just didn&#8217;t have the stamina to hang in and watch it all unfold. :op<span class="fullpost"></p>
<p>This is a day that I&#8217;ve been waiting for for about three years – the day that SCOREcast grows up, takes the gloves off, puts its big-boy pants on and gets serious about mentoring, coaching, and helping people navigate through the jungle of the film music business.</p>
<p>This launch has not been without its obstacles, pratfalls, and perils &#8211; most of them technical, of course &#8211; as we&#8217;ve tried to figure out the best way to bring you all the content you want and have come to expect from the SCOREcast podcasts over the years. But the biggest challenge was not technical at all. In all honesty, my biggest fear was that some of you might be thinking what I would be thinking if I were you: &#8220;Oh great! Another film music site that is going to over-promise and under-deliver. Another site that is going to tell me how much they can help me if I sign up for their membership, download their guide, and attend their seminar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well&#8230; no. Actually, not at all. When we started broadcasting podcast episodes in October of 2006, I promised myself that if we ever made it difficult for people to get into the film music world by making them jump through a bunch of hoops to get to our content, then we have failed at our objectives. I&#8217;ve said it before on the podcast, and I&#8217;ll say it again here: There has never been a better time for you to launch your career in film music, and SCOREcast is a tool for you to use to accomplish that goal. Pure and simple. No strings attached. Besides, the best things in life are still free, baby!</p>
<p>But in all seriousness, that IS the essence of SCOREcast: Helping you launch and maintain a healthy, lasting, and fruitful film music career. Here you will find seasoned mentors as well as people who have never written a note. Here you will find people who are interested in sharing with you the TRUTH about how they got into this business, as well as people who will share with you the TRUTH about why they never quite made it. Here you will find those who are not afraid to talk to you about what you should be doing, as well as those who will tell you what you are doing right.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all been there. Everyone started somewhere. Whether we were assistants to composers or scoring student films for pizza and beer, we&#8217;ve all been at the crossroads of not knowing where to go next to get to the next level in our careers. So, this is where all of that wondering and not knowing can change for you as you peel back the onion that is this business.</p>
<p>My advice? Get involved here at SCOREcastOnline.com. <span style="font-style: italic;">Login for free</span> (!!!) and get to know some folks. There are thousands of people here that listen to our podcasts every month that are in the same boat you are in, and there are just as many that have achieved in this business what you desire to achieve in your own career. So why reinvent the wheel? Find those people &#8211; they love to talk about this stuff &#8211; and get to know them. The new way of the world is &#8220;access&#8221;. Use it that opportunity here at SCOREcastOnline.com and be enriched by it.</p>
<p>As SCOREcast launches into this new era, come on the ride with us. I promise it will be worth the adventure!</span></p>

But, how do you know if you are good?]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is the secret to success as a film composer? We all talk about networking, internet promotion, social networks, building your image, people skills, getting press, websites, gear, DAWs, sample libraries—all of these are important, but dependent on one thing: the quality and uniqueness of your work. If your music is mediocre, if it sounds like every other bloke out there with a drive full of VSTs, then all of your marketing efforts won’t matter much.</p>
<p>As you know, for better and for worse, the barrier to entry into film scoring has been lowered. With a few pieces of software you now have all the tools to create a complete film score. The downside is that people no longer need to know how to read or write music, be proficient at their instrument, or have a true knowledge of orchestration. Is that bad? Not in itself, but the result is that the film score landscape has become so homogeneous that an agent recently told me producers can now identify <em>Storm Drum</em> just by hearing it on the demos they are sent!</p>
<p>That’s potentially good for you. This means you have a chance to separate yourself by working harder at your craft and being unique. Don’t just rehash what others have done, it’s not a good career move. Being unique takes hard work and is not an accident. But how do you know if you are good? Can you judge for yourself? To answer this question, I present to you &#8230;drum roll please&#8230; the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" target="_blank">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>, a report that states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>“&#8230;an unskilled person makes poor decisions and reaches erroneous conclusions, but their incompetence denies them the meta-cognitive ability to realize their mistakes. The unskilled therefore suffer from illusory superiority, rating their own ability as above average, much higher than it actually is, while the highly skilled underrate their abilities, suffering from illusory inferiority. This leads to the situation in which less competent people rate their own ability higher than more competent people.”</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But someone who is in this position can be made to “recognize and acknowledge their own previous lack of skill, if they can be trained to substantially improve.”</p>
<p>In other words: If you think you are great, then you probably aren’t and don’t even have the tools to recognize excellence. If you are plagued with self-doubt, then you are probably doing okay.</p>
<p>I am sure that this brings to mind at least one person to each of you, or perhaps more!</p>
<p>The irony, though, is that the person who suffers from the Dunning-Kruger effect is blissfully unaware of his own shortcomings. So who’s to say it’s not <em>you</em> who is clueless? Based on this study, there is only one solution, one that I completely agree with: <em>reach a high level of musical study</em>. (And no, elementary harmony and voice-leading does not count!) A high level of music study will give you the tools to recognize and reach excellence, to have music that stands above the sea of DAW-Warriors. As a result your music will stand apart. Producers and directors will notice you—the quality of your work will make you an asset to them and they will proudly recommend you to others, because in this business, recommendations and word of mouth are the most potent marketing tools.</p>
<p>Do you think you suffer from the Dunning-Kruger effect?</p>
