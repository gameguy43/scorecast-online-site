		<description><![CDATA[Since picture is king, and the music serves the picture, any theme that gets up and running always runs the chance of being interrupted at any point along the way, so any semblance of &quot;form&quot; is thrown out the door. When an unexpected visual happens, it would be counterproductive to score the action by musically leading up to the unexpected, thereby ruining the surprise. Yes, music must have the capacity to &quot;turn on its ear&quot; at any moment, shift gears, and beeline off in a brand-new direction -- or simply become completely silent, an interrupted thought. Now, here&#039;s another thought: by not scoring a scene -- or by &quot;scoring&quot; it with silence --  does one run the risk of infringing on John Cage&#039;s copyrighted &quot;4:33&quot;?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;For me, the form is not the visual, but the narrative&quot;

But I think there are some very real considerations that come from the visuals. For example, from on orchestration point of view, IMHO the size of the ensemble should match the size of the room in the picture.  I know that&#039;s not musical form per-say, but I defiantly think the visuals have to be a consideration as you write.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This seems like an obvious part of the equation, but given the correct circumstance — let&#039;s use Ryan&#039;s example of a main title, or a montage — the relevancy of using classical form in film music certainly depends greatly on the composer and his or her compositional tastes and tendencies. Many of John Williams&#039; popular main titles, for instance, tend to reveal the use of form. Leonard Rosenman broke into a fugue in &lt;i&gt;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&lt;/i&gt;. These are very &quot;trained&quot; composers who care much for the classical roots in film music — this isn&#039;t to say that informally trained composers &lt;i&gt;don&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; care. But using myself as an example, I grew up with an obsession with listening to film music (not classical or popular music), and as a result, the idea of utilizing classical form has never once entered my mind when writing, least of all being tempted to run off into a fugue. On the other hand, this non-tendency can be somewhat of a hinderance, since I often find it much more difficult to write a full-fledged theme.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Absolutely - I agree.  It&#039;s purely conceptual, not practical, which is why I led off my post with the idea that imposing musical form on screen would be superfluous.  The other factor is that many narratives are also based on external factors - ie: human experiences.  Instead of &#039;pure&#039; form, where we say this is almost like a mathematical equation, you have the messiness of human life encroaching on the film, and the music is responding to that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I saw an interview with John WIlliams where he said that the form of film music is the movie. It’s a lot like opera or ballet, the form is (at least partly) dictated by external factors. That said, there is still room for traditional form, particularly in title sequences and montages. Williams himself used a fugue in a montage in JAWS. Herrmann explained that in the famous Breakfast Table sequence in CITIZEN KANE, the form was dictated by the form of the montage : theme and variations. Almost of all Korngold’s main titles use an abbreviated sonata allegro form. 

Adrian - whenever I explain sonata allegro form to film students they immediately point out the parallel to screenplay structure. It’s interesting conceptually, but in practice that doesn’t really work. Most film scores are based on multiple themes that develop throughout all three acts. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To me form is everything and understanding the formal structure of music is as equally important as understanding harmony, melody, or orchestration. It&#039;s not in the direct application of classical forms like sonata, rondo, or others to film but rather knowing the reasons why these forms exist. How did sonata form evolve and why? The answers to those questions are as every bit as important in film music today as they were to classical composers back then. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I feel like trying to impose musical form would be like trying to lay in the design concept for a bicycle when you are trying to build a car.  For me, the form is not the visual, but the narrative - the story.   Instead of (say) a movements you might have acts.  Instead of A and B sections, you might have exposition vs first conflict/inciting incident (or call to action), and so on.  We are film makers after all!

In films where composers are actually still writing an opening titles overture, the story of the film is told - so you might have an introduction, exposition, first conflict, building tension, climax, and denouement/epilogue.  In a way, (and this is a very superficial and simplified examination) you can kind of line up the sonata form with the 3 act structure: Introduction (Act I - setup), Exposition (ditto), Development (Act II - conflict), Recapitulation &#038; Coda (Act III - resolution).  If you wanted to get more specific, I&#039;m sure you could outline a score to a film using the Hero&#039;s Journey or Monomyth, which seems to be the template for most Western narrative films.
