With a simple speech about how kids who have dreams of entering into the entertainment industry should never listen to those who say it is &#8220;a waste of time&#8221;, Giacchino accepted his award with grace and respect, and then went and sat back down in his seat for the rest of the show.<\/p>\n<p>With a contentious race in many categories, including Best Original Score, it didn&#8217;t take long before I was seeing people on Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, and Tumblr light into Giacchino, assessing his win as a &#8220;fraud&#8221;, a &#8220;mistake&#8221;, a &#8220;travesty&#8221;, &#8220;non-deserving&#8221;, and even &#8220;political&#8221; (Political? WTF? Really?) Since the awards broadcast, I&#8217;ve even received several emails from people in our community asking me what I thought of &#8220;someone like Giacchino winning the award up against Horner and Hans&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Someone like Giacchino?&#8221; <\/em>What does that even mean?<\/p>\n<p>Over the last 24 hours, the vitriolic criticism of Giacchino&#8217;s win is, frankly, astounding \u2014 things I&#8217;m ashamed to even mention here&#8230; so I won&#8217;t. Suffice it to say that some of the things I&#8217;ve read are some of the most ridiculous arguments against <em>anyone<\/em> winning <em>any<\/em> award at <em>any<\/em> ceremony for <em>anything<\/em> they&#8217;ve <em>ever<\/em> accomplished. It&#8217;s just been plain stupid.<\/p>\n<p>Before I continue, I want to make it clear: I do not know Michael Giacchino. I&#8217;ve never met the man. I do know many people on his team, and have worked with people who also have worked with him, but I do not know him personally. I will say that in the years I&#8217;ve been working and living in Los Angeles as a film composer, I&#8217;ve never heard a sideways word about Giacchino. That aside, however, what cannot be argued is that Giacchino is one of the busiest composers in the business, and in this industry, you don&#8217;t get to keep coming to the sleepovers if you continually poop the bed. So I have to wonder what the motivation is to cut this guy down. I don&#8217;t get it.<\/p>\n<p>But it doesn&#8217;t matter whether I know Mr. Giacchino or not. The things I&#8217;ve read over the last twenty-four hours have surprised even this composer, who thought that he&#8217;d seen it all and heard it all. To be sure, cutting down others isn&#8217;t unheard of in this town, especially considering that a high level of competition is one of the main cords that binds our little community together and makes it so interesting. Competition, as we talked about last month here at SCOREcast, comes with the territory of being in business for one&#8217;s self, no matter what the profession.<\/p>\n<p>But who are the people chattering in the dark about Giacchino, only 24 hours after his Oscar victory?<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Composers.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Giacchino&#8217;s own community of colleagues are the ones doing the cutting. It&#8217;s not some Nicolas Chartier-conspiracy that is to blame for this. It&#8217;s his own community.<\/p>\n<p>And it extends beyond Michael Giacchino. In fact, here at SCOREcast, we&#8217;ve seen all kinds of listeners and readers write in with negative accusations and heated and highly-charged opinions about the alleged detriment of Hans Zimmer&#8217;s influence in the community, as well as allegations of him being someone who doesn&#8217;t do what he proclaims he does \u2014 and I&#8217;ve never understood it. Is it jealousy? Envy? Anger? What?<\/p>\n<p>Year after year, month after month, day after day, I hear composers in this industry talk about how &#8220;the studios are the enemy, our craft is under-appreciated, our budgets are laughable, and there is no work out there for anyone. But I would propose this, instead:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s not the studios&#8217; fault, or the economy, or the projects and budgets shrinking that has led to the composing community being the red-headed step-child of the filmmaking process. It&#8217;s the composers. It is our fault. <em>We do it to ourselves.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Is it any wonder that this community is trying to argue the need for a union predicated largely on that fact that undercutting each other for gigs has become a way of life? Is that the fault of the studios? Of course not. So in other words, we need a union to protect us from&#8230; us. Nice.<\/p>\n<p>There are many things wrong with the system, but therefore, since the system is run by people, the people need to change before the system will change. Reform happens when people get sick and tired of being sick and tired and mobilize to change themselves and the things they can control. Reform doesn&#8217;t happen when people mobilize to change things that are beyond of their control.<\/p>\n<p>So, with that, allow me to speak directly to <em>you<\/em>:<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nCOMPOSERS<\/strong><br \/>\nStop your bitching. You think Hans deserved the award over Giacchino? Marco? Desplat? Horner? Perhaps so. But they didn&#8217;t get it. For whatever reason (and I have my own, but again, they don&#8217;t matter!) the Academy found them all wanting and deemed Giacchino&#8217;s score the best work of 2009. Do you really have nothing better to do than to sit around for 24 hours and make case after case as to why you believe Michael doesn&#8217;t deserve this honor? As if you know anything about playing at that level yet? How about a few positive strokes to a fellow colleague for winning something that only five people, out of hundreds of thousands, were in the running for? I mean, I know the Oscars can be political&#8230; but really? Giacchino? I never saw any lobbying on his part for the award. Not once. No ads, no commercials. I spend a fair amount of time on the Disney lot. There was nobody standing outside of the music department handing out &#8220;UP!&#8221; CDs with <em>&#8220;For Your Consideration&#8221;<\/em> embossed across them (I know they exist, but you know what I mean!). No giant billboards with Giacchino&#8217;s name and likeness sprawled out for us all to see.<\/p>\n<p>C&#8217;mon. Examine what it is in you that feels the need to cut someone down every time they accomplish something you do not. This extends to losing gigs to other composers, losing awards to other composers, having the fame and fortune (huh?) of other composers, and having the nice studio that another composer might have. So&#8230; you haven&#8217;t made it to their level yet. So what. Go write something that is worthy of an accolade. Go orchestrate one of your cues in a manner that is worth us all listening to. Hone your skills. Get better. WRITE BETTER MUSIC and get competitive *that* way. Updating your status on Facebook to reflect your disgust for what someone else has beat you to is not only childish and stupid but also petty and ugly. My SCOREcast cohort Lee Sanders and I compete with each other ALL THE TIME, yet I consider Lee one of my best friends and I cannot imagine him not in my life.<\/p>\n<p>Stop whining about what you are NOT getting and start working toward what you CAN get. Nobody is going to feel bad that you think your music is better than someone else&#8217;s and why couldn&#8217;t a producer just give you a chance \u2014 no one is going to give you a chance until you learn to shut your negative mouth&#8230; <em>and take some chances<\/em>. If you don&#8217;t risk yourself a bit, who would ever bother risking themselves for you?<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nREPRESENTATIVES<\/strong><br \/>\nStart being genuine. Quit pitting composers against other composers in your same stable (I know you&#8217;ll never do this, but we all have always wondered how you can possibly look us in the eye with a straight face after doing so&#8230;. so what the hell. I&#8217;m putting it out there.)<\/p>\n<p>Bet on us like we bet on you. Work a little harder toward at least making us feel like we are the only client you have. I know some of you do that now, and kudos to those of you who operate in that way \u2014 I am one of the lucky clients of someone whom I never have to worry about in that regard. But for others of you, your clients will be the first to tell you that you make them feel small, worthless, insignificant, and unimportant. Stop texting and taking calls while we are trying to talk business with you. Rid yourself of the phrase, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&#8230; I have to take this!&#8221; when you are in our presence. Whomever it is, I&#8217;m sure they can wait 30 minutes until we are done talking. Try and remember the details of things we tell you we are interested in pursuing. Write it down somewhere or something. Buy some Sticky Notes. Get an iPhone.<\/p>\n<p>Focus more on career development than on agency development. Let the success of your clients be the catalyst by which word of mouth champions your brand. You promote us, and we&#8217;ll promote you. It&#8217;s pretty simple. Of all of the people in this industry, you have the greatest vantage point as to the path a career should go (and is capable of going). Share your reality with us. Wake us up. Guide us. Help us. Direct us. Shape and mold us. We&#8217;ll listen \u2014 we respect you. If we didn&#8217;t, we probably wouldn&#8217;t be working with you anyway \u2014 it&#8217;s not like we can give up hunting down our own gigs just because we have representation. That&#8217;s not a slam, it&#8217;s just the way this business works. We are a team, and if the whole team hunts, the whole team eats. Teach us how to be better hunters. We <em>want<\/em> to make you rich.<\/p>\n<p><strong>IN CLOSING&#8230;<\/strong><br \/>\nWhen I started SCOREcast in 2006, my aim was to bring our community closer together \u2014 for us to grow smaller as we grow larger. A little of that has happened and it makes me very happy. But the reality of the situation is that no podcast, website, technology, organization, procedure, or process can really do what needs to be done to make that fully happen. Only the people can. Only we can, as people. Composers and their teams have to start supporting each other and learning how to be positive and encouraging, rather than negative and destructive towards one another.<\/p>\n<p>I am not advocating us turning a blind eye to the very real issues that plague our profession, but rather than instead of shaking our heads and complaining about them, we instead take some action and take an active role in the process of correcting them. It is so easy to sit on the sidelines and &#8220;armchair-quarterback&#8221; as the game is played on the field by others.<\/p>\n<p>Start being a lightning rod of good in this community. I challenge you to that. We need that from you. Stop posturing on your Facebook pages and your Twitter accounts against those that have worked hard to get where they are. I don&#8217;t care what you think of Hans Zimmer. Have you met him? Have you sat and talked with him? Maybe you could learn a lot from someone in his position. Better yet, maybe you could learn something from him as a person. As a human being. Forget his music. What kind of wisdom could he impart to you as someone who has worked himself to the top of the heap and doesn&#8217;t look to be going anywhere soon? Michael Giacchino, in the grand scheme of things, is a relative newcomer to the game. He is one of the first of the &#8220;new generation&#8221; of film composers to start winning Academy Awards. He&#8217;s only a few years older than I am. That&#8217;s inspiring to me \u2014 it affirms that this generation&#8217;s time is now. We are on the right track, making great choices, and moving in the right direction.<\/p>\n<p>Use these guys as inspiration instead of vilifying them and crucifying them with your opinions. They are working hard at their craft and working towards the same goals that you are. Believe me. They&#8217;ve been where you are and they&#8217;ve seen a way to rise to the next level. Don&#8217;t buy into the old story that it&#8217;s &#8220;all about luck&#8221;. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s about a lot of things \u2014 relationships, hard work, persistence, tutelage, experience, and making mistakes&#8230; just to name a few.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>And the Oscar goes to&#8230;.
