					<description><![CDATA[I disagree slightly, Roy. There are many people (myself included) who don&#039;t even know what you are talking about when you you say &quot;San Isidro McDonald&#039;s massacre in 1984&quot; because it was back in 1984, well ahead of the &quot;always on&quot; digital age we are experiencing now. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s as easy to &quot;forget&quot; today as it might have been in 1984. 28 years was almost two generations ago. A lot about how people communicate and &quot;remember&quot; has changed in almost 30 years.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately people do forget.  Unless we keep reminding people like 9/11 eventually people move on.  There probably aren&#039;t many people that remember the San Isidro Mcdonald&#039;s massacre back in 84.  Most people probably assume that Colombine was the first.  50 years from now we&#039;ll be talking about a different massacre and these will be forgotten.]]></description>
