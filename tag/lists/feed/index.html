<p>There has been much heated discussion this week about whether <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001877/">Hans Zimmer</a> can really be called an &#8220;influential&#8221; composer, but the proof seems to be in the pudding: Zimmer&#8217;s output from 1999 until now is impressive, and includes first class film scores for thirteen of the highest grossing films of the past decade. It only seems fitting that he would take our #1 spot, and that SCOREcast readers would vote his score, co-written with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0314713/">Lisa Gerrard</a>, to Ridley Scott&#8217;s epic masterpiece <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i> as the number one most influential score of the past decade.</p>
<p>But before we get into the analysis of why <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i> took the top spot on our countdown, let&#8217;s recap how we got to this point, starting with the beginning of the Top 10 list (click on any title to read SCOREcast analysis from each score, and comments from the SCOREcast readership):</p>

<p><b>HANS ZIMMER&#8217;S <i>GLADIATOR</i></b><br />Ridley Scott&#8217;s <b><i>GLADIATOR</i></b> was a critical and box office smash. It was nominated for 119 awards between the Oscars, BAFTA&#8217;s, Golden Globes, among others, and won five of its nominated twelve Academy Awards. One of the more controversial of <b><i>GLADIATOR</i></b>&#8216;s honors was the Academy&#8217;s &#8220;Best Original Music Score&#8221; nomination for  Hans Zimmer&#8217;s score for the film. Despite sharing considerable credit with Lisa Gerrard and Klaus Badelt for the writing of <b><i>GLADIATOR</i></b>, only Zimmer was nominated for the Oscar. After a big win at the Golden Globes for Zimmer and Gerrard, the team lost the Oscar to Tan Dun&#8217;s <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i>, a loss that subsequently  led to the Academy&#8217;s move to bar nominations of scores by more than one composer for many years thereafter.</p>
<p>In spite of all of that, however, not since James Horner&#8217;s <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_%28soundtrack%29" title="Titanic (soundtrack)">Titanic</a></i> soundtrack (which sold millions) had a movie score been in such high demand.</p>
<p>Leading up to the film&#8217;s release, most people who were able to get an advanced copy of the score tossed it aside as &#8220;typical fare from Zimmer&#8221; and really didn&#8217;t treat it with any kind of seriousness. This is why it is interesting that <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i> has gone on to become one of the most imitated scores in recent history, introducing the trend of the &#8220;mournful female vocal&#8221;, ala Lisa Gerrard.&nbsp; More scores than we can count (<i>The Passion of the Christ</i>, <i>Troy</i>, <i>The Quiet American</i>, <i>Kingdom of Heaven</i>, etc.) have taken Zimmer up on his suggestion that sorrowful female chanting is the best way to invoke any sense of historic drama in a foreign land.</p>
<p>Admittedly, Hans Zimmer is a product of his influences as a composer, and on several occasions has talked publicly about his being steered by the works of Wagner and Holst while writing the score for <i><b>GLADIATO </b></i>(more on this later). Particularly on several of the cues in <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i>, Zimmer created what he deemed was &#8220;early Roman music&#8221; (when in reality, nobody truly knows <i>what</i> that should sound like. This caused some controversy since the first and second acts of the film take place in Morocco. Speaking of this style in an interview shortly after the score was released, Zimmer commented on the reason he used heavy duduk playing and female vocals to help differentiate the two styles:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div align="JUSTIFY">Half of <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i> takes place in Morocco so I   think I have a fairly legitimate reason for using this style. But really   it was more that I loved Lisa Gerrard&#8217;s voice.<span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>Lisa grew   up in Melbourne&#8217;s Turkish community and she has a very strong style but there   is a purity about it and a truthfulness. Lisa is a formidable woman; she   is not just a &#8216;Pop Diva&#8217;, she has enormous intelligence, integrity, and   musicality. When I first contacted her about working with me on <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i> her she politely declined, saying it wasn&#8217;t quite her cup   of tea, but when she saw some footage, she finally agreed and she was eager   enough to catch the next plane. I admire that attitude, I would much rather   work with somebody with that artistic integrity than with somebody who will   say &#8216;yes&#8217; to anything. I needed to find a tender woman&#8217;s voice because <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i>&#8216;s opening scene   is idyllic, a poetic image of a wheat field with a hand drifting over it   and all you hear is Lisa&#8217;s voice. I wanted the music at that point to evoke   Maximus&#8217;s home, to signify the place where he was happiest. Ultimately that   theme turns into the &#8216;Elysium&#8217; music. But then I was also desperately trying to find a way of showing that our   main character, Maximus, was not really, in the beginning, associated with   the Roman Empire. He was a Spaniard. In fact, in passing, I&#8217;ve noticed that   Spain and Spaniards have been associated with many of my new scores. There   were two Spaniards in <i>The Road to El Dorado.</i> <i>Mission Impossible   2</i> starts in Spain and, of course, <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i> has a Spanish hero. When I compose, I start by trying to write at least somewhat geographically   but then you remember that so much music has its roots in the Middle East.   </div>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i> is a truly remarkable score, if only for the legacy that has lived long after its release in other film scores of its ilk. Another notable  <i><b>GLADIATOR </b></i>remnant  — and the one that  Zimmer probably wishes everyone would forget about — is the lawsuit that stemmed from the score&#8217;s release, citing an infringement by Zimmer and his way of gaining  inspiration in writing the music. In June 2006, agents representing the estate of composer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Holst" title="Gustav Holst">Gustav Holst</a> (1874–1934) filed a lawsuit claiming that Zimmer plagiarized material from the<i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Planets" title="The Planets">The Planets</a></i>. Specifically, &#8220;The Battle&#8221; was believed to plagiarize Holst&#8217;s &#8220;Mars, the bringer of war&#8221;<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator_%28soundtrack%29#cite_note-0"></a></sup>. The track &#8220;Barbarian Horde&#8221; reprises most of these themes. Additionally, film music critics assessed that the score also borrows heavily from the works of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner" title="Richard Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>, particularly themes from <i>Siegfried and Gotterdammerung</i>, included in the latter half of &#8220;The Might of Rome&#8221; and &#8220;Am I Not Merciful?&#8221;</p>
<p>If SCOREcast&#8217;s list of the <u><i>Top 10 Most Influential Scores of the Past Decade</i></u> has taught us anything at all, it&#8217;s that the more influential a score seems to be, the more scrutinized it also becomes. Hans Zimmer&#8217;s score for <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i> might be one of the most investigated and examined score&#8217;s in the history of film, yet his music for this epic motion picture is as much an influential force in the film music vernacular today as it was when it was released almost ten years ago.</p>
<p>Why do you think Zimmer&#8217;s music for <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i> was voted #1 on&nbsp; this list as being the most &#8220;influential&#8221;? How does it differ from other scores in the same genre in the last ten years? Does it compete with the work Zimmer has done for other projects in any way? Is it up to par with that work?</p>
<p>Most interestingly, how has the music of <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i> affected your composing style or your thoughts on composing for picture? What other scores have you heard that are obviously influenced by <i><b>GLADIATOR</b></i>?</p>

<p>A second-generation member of Hollywood&#8217;s preeminent musical dynasty, composer <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002353/">Thomas Newman</a> weighs in on our countdown with the #2 most influential score of the past decade: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169547/"><i><b><span style="font-size: small;">AMERICAN BEAUT</span>Y</b></i></a><span id="intelliTXT">.</span></p>
<p><span id="intelliTXT"><i><b>AMERICAN BEAUTY</b></i> score was nominated for an Academy Award, but lost to John Corigliano&#8217;s &#8220;The Red Violin&#8221;. </span><span id="intelliTXT">Perhaps just what kind of influence Newman&#8217;s score has bestowed on modern film composing can be summed up by a comment on the <i>Movie Music UK</i> website:&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p><span id="intelliTXT">&#8220;</span>It&#8217;s difficult to know what to say about Thomas Newman&#8217;s score, except that it can probably be summed up by one simple word: unconventional. You only need to look at the list of instruments used in the score&#8217;s make-up to see what I mean &#8211; tablas, kim-kim drums, bird calls, mandolas, Appalachian dulcimers, lap steel guitars, ukuleles, arpeggiated violins, detuned mandolins. And a <i>saz</i> &#8211; whatever a <i>saz</i> is.<span id="intelliTXT">&#8220;</span></p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><span id="intelliTXT">The fact is that when <i><b>AMERICAN BEAUTY</b></i> was first released, most people didn&#8217;t know what to make of Newman&#8217;s score at all. It was so incredibly eclectic, that it was literally impossible to categorize. However, time has taught that there were two things that Newman&#8217;s score would leave as a marked change in the way films are scored, particularly adult character-driven dramatic films: Two cues&#8230; &#8220;Dead Already&#8221; and &#8220;Any Other Name&#8221;.</span><i><b><span id="intelliTXT">&nbsp;</span></b></i></p>
<p><i><b><span id="intelliTXT">&#8220;Dead Already&#8221;</span></b></i><br /><span id="intelliTXT">&#8220;Dead Already&#8221;, the lead cue in </span><span id="intelliTXT"><i><b>AMERICAN BEAUTY</b></i></span><span id="intelliTXT">, is a 3/4 time electro-acoustic whirlwind of marimba, guitar, tablas, detuned mandolin, dulcimer, lap steel, and various percussive odds and ends. It has become the quintessential cue associated with &#8220;quirkiness&#8221; in film scoring. Countless scenes in film that have come along since and required some sort of quirky, offbeat, and angular music to carry them have been temped with &#8220;Dead Already&#8221;. The style of the cue has been requested over and over, even of Newman himself, who has struggled to work his way out of the cage that </span><span id="intelliTXT"><i><b>AMERICAN BEAUTY</b></i> more or less put him in. Fortunately, Newman&#8217;s skills are magnificent, both as a composer and as an interpreter of cinema, that he has not had to toil too long in his own shadow.</span></p>

<p><i><b><span id="intelliTXT">&#8220;Any Other Name&#8221;</span></b></i><br /><span id="intelliTXT">&#8220;Any Other Name&#8221;  is a minimalist piano theme, set over a spacial synth pad, which develops over time as two of the main characters begin to fall in love. As the cue unfolds, Newman brings in what has now become known as his signature sound — a lush, washy, and weighty string and woodwind section that breathes depth and dimension to the solitary piano lines. </span><span id="intelliTXT">&#8220;Any Other Name&#8221;</span><span id="intelliTXT"> has been used in temp after temp (<i>Akeelah and the Bee</i>; <i>About Schmidt</i>; <i>Lost in Translation</i>; <i>Fahrenheit 911</i>, etc.), commercial after commercial (<i>M&amp;M&#8217;s</i>, <i>State Farm Insurance</i>, <i>First Alert Security Systems</i>, and dozens more), and even in theme parks (Six Flags&#8217; <i>Great America</i> and <i>Magic Mountain</i>). The haunting melodic theme — the only legitimate theme in the score — is as moving a piano line as there ever was, and when mixed with the visual in which it is paired with most remarkably in the film (a plastic bag swirling in the wind on a sidewalk), it evokes everything memorable about the film itself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;"><b>#3 &#8211; THE BOURNE IDENTITY<br /></b></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><b><i>(John Powell)</i></b></span></p>
<p><span id="intelliTXT">Film music is a highly subjective artform. What really makes something musical in relation to a film has been changing since the days of the first &#8220;talkies&#8221;, and the evolution of the medium is never standing still. Who would have ever thought that Hitch&#8217;s <i>Psycho</i> shower scene would require nothing more from Herrmann than screaming violins – or that Williams would get away with a two-note theme in <i>Jaws</i>?</span></p>
<p><span id="intelliTXT">In 2002, when  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0694173/">John Powell</a>&#8216;s </span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258463/"><i><b>THE BOURNE IDENTITY</b></i></a> music hit the 5.1 decoder in theaters, most people wondered &#8220;How could a guy score a film using mainly pulse percussion, techno synth patterns, and flourishes of orchestral staccato?&#8221; In fact, Powell&#8217;s music for this entire franchise is oddly served up: He never really commits to a main theme (the &#8220;Identity&#8221; <i>theme</i> from <b><i>TBI</i></b> is the most memorable of the three films) and he never really commits to a particular previously-established style. But two things are for sure: The tone of the Bourne films and the sounds Powell scores them with are all his own. <span id="intelliTXT">In most of the action sequences, Powell starts with some sort of either string or percussion pulse, adds increasingly complex techno-fused synth lines, and then builds in layers with orchestral padding until the  intensity within the scene is matched by the intensity of the music. Then, he quickly tosses whatever thematic elements he&#8217;s cached aside, never to be heard again in many cases, and moves on to building up the next action set-piece in exactly the same way. At times, this &#8220;process&#8221; seems exhaustively repetitive&#8230;<br /></span><br /><span id="intelliTXT"><br /></span><br /><span id="intelliTXT">&#8230; Which might be this score&#8217;s point of influence right there. <i><u>John Powell&#8217;s score for </u></i></span><i><u><span style="font-size: small;"><b>THE BOURNE IDENTITY</b></span></u></i><span id="intelliTXT"><i><u> is repetitive</u></i>. But in a very enjoyable fashion. It simply doesn&#8217;t annoy, and in fact, isn&#8217;t noticeable until you listen to it disconnected from its cinematic experience. This &#8220;repetition&#8221; technique, now popular with a lot of loop-based and sample-heavy scores (and brought to its full realization in Powell&#8217;s score for 2006&#8217;s <i>United 93</i>), is derivative almost entirely of John Powell</span><span id="intelliTXT">, and might be the sole influencing factor that this score (and much of his subsequent work) has had on modern film scoring. Case in point:  Harry Gregson-Williams, Klaus Badelt, and Bryan Tyler seem to be trying to clone Powell&#8217;s <i>identity</i> in many of their recent efforts.<br /></span></p>
<p>Why do you think John Powell&#8217;s music for <i><b>THE BOURNE IDENTITY</b></i> was voted onto this list as being &#8220;influential&#8221;? How does it differ from other scores in the same genre in the last ten years? Does it compete with the work Powell has done for other projects in any way? Is it up to par with that work?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;"><b>#4 &#8211; THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy<br /></b></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><b><i>(Howard Shore)</i></b></span></p>
<p><span id="intelliTXT"><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006290/">Howard   Shore</a>&#8216;s Oscar-winning,  Golden Globe-nominated, and Grammy Award-winning score to <i>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</i> was just the  beginning of an epic 12-hour long <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/"><i><b>THE LORD OF THE RINGS</b></i></a> saga that would push Shore into the immediate consciousness of not only film music fans, but music lovers the world over.</span></p>
<p><span id="intelliTXT">Throughout our &#8220;Most Influential Scores of the Past Decade&#8221; series, a lot of discussion has been raised about the importance of &#8220;themes&#8221;. Well, if themes is what you want, then look no further than Shore&#8217;s </span><i><b>LOTR</b></i> music, because there are over 40 themes fleshed out in the series. The three main themes (the ones you&#8217;ll hear  incessantly in trailers, TV commercials, and even during pre-flight instruction videos for Jet Blue Airlines) are the Fellowship, Rohan, and Shire themes, but there are so many variants on these three themes during the course of the films that an entire coursework could easily be constructed around identifying them all.</p>
<p><span id="intelliTXT">Like the  films, Shore&#8217;s thematic elements similarly evolved through the course of the  three installments. </span><span id="intelliTXT">As <i>The Two Towers</i> introduced and developed the Rohan theme as the  primary component to that film&#8217;s story, <i>The  Return of the King</i> brings in and develops Shore&#8217;s grand themes for the  people of Gondor and Minas Tirith.</span> </p>
<p>Shore&#8217;s other major feat was in his musical interpretation of a 5,000 year-old world — a world wholly conceived in J.R.R. Tolkien&#8217;s imagination. In Shore&#8217;s composition you can detect smatterings of influence from the Celtic songs of Turlough O&#8217;Carollan to the spicy textures of  Middle Eastern folk tunes; a hearty alchemy of  various other world folk and roots tones.</p>
<p><span id="intelliTXT">All in all, it is hard to even discuss Shore&#8217;s achievement here, since the undertaking of scoring something like </span><i><b>LOTR </b></i><span id="intelliTXT">had to have been so exceptionally monumental, but </span><span id="intelliTXT">Shore&#8217;s music for </span><i><b>LOTR </b></i><span id="intelliTXT">is  simply breathtaking and his  thematic development of the storyline is a masterclass in how it&#8217;s done.</span></p>
<p>Why do you think Shore&#8217;s music for <i><b>LOTR</b></i> was voted onto this list as being &#8220;influential&#8221;? How does it differ from other scores in the same genre in the last ten years? Does it compete with the work Shore has done for other projects in any way? Is it up to par with that work?</p>
<p>Most interestingly, how has the music of <i><b>LOTR</b></i> affected your composing style or your thoughts on composing for picture? What other scores have you heard that are obviously influenced by <i><b>LOTR</b></i>?</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SshaIVtAfUI/AAAAAAAAAv4/5HNFTFblwHY/s1600-h/ff_pirates_object_468.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SshaIVtAfUI/AAAAAAAAAv4/5HNFTFblwHY/s200/ff_pirates_object_468.jpg" /></a></div>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><b>#5 &#8211; THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN trilogy<br /></b></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><b><i>(Klaus Badelt/Hans Zimmer)</i></b></span></p>
<p>Blaring brass, sawing strings, playful woodwinds, bombastic percussion, ghostly choirs&#8230; It&#8217;s the latest release from EastWest! Uh&#8230; or a cue from the Jerry Bruckheimer/Disney franchise <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980/"><i><b>THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN</b></i></a>.</p>
<p>Okay, look. We know this one is going to start a flame war&#8230; but before you comment on why this score is the end to all that&#8217;s right and holy in our industry, just remember&#8230; YOU VOTED FOR THESE! </p>
<p><i><b>THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN</b></i> started out being something that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001877/">Hans Zimmer</a> never thought would amount to much <i>(TPOTC: The Curse of the Black Pearl; 2003)</i>, and ended up being probably one of the definitive works of his career <i>(TPOTC: At World&#8217;s End; 2007)</i>. Originally handed off to protege <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0046004/">Klaus Badelt</a> to handle (with Zimmer &#8220;producing&#8221; as an overseer&#8230; Lead balloon, much?), <i><b>TPOTC</b> </i>might be solely responsible for the deluge of overproduced scores that we now have cluttering up the shelf space in our score CD collections.</p>
<p>However, if you listen to modern scoring in action films these days, you&#8217;ll notice remnants of <i><b>TPOTC</b></i> threaded through many things your hear. True, Zimmerites are Zimmerites and they mostly sound similar, careful not to stray too far from the proven RC/MV formula, but <i><b>TPOTC</b></i> was slightly different. It boasted a bit of a playful side from Zimmer that we hadn&#8217;t seen in quite some time, maybe not since his work on 1998&#8217;s <i>The Prince of Egypt</i>, where he let a bit of his tongue-in-cheekyness shine through on a few cues. That same tone peeked through in Badelt&#8217;s work on the first <i><b>TPOTC</b></i> score in 2003, but really became the signature stroke of the series in 2006 when Zimmer put himself in the pilot seat for the remaining two sequels, starting with  his 2006 score to  <i><b>TPOTC: Dead Man&#8217;s Chest</b></i>.</p>
<p><b><i>TPOTC: </i></b><span id="intelliTXT"><b><i>Curse of the Black Pearl</i></b> was annihilated by critics when it first came out because Badelt chose to mix his orchestra heavily with synthesized lines, making the music feel somewhat inauthentic to the genre and erasing some of the power that film score fans were used to in previous swashbuckling outings like John Debney&#8217;s<i> Cutthroat</i><i> Island</i> and, to a lesser degree, Michael Kamen&#8217;s <i>Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves</i>. But if Badelt&#8217;s hand was too weary for wear, those same fickle critics would say Zimmer was &#8220;over the top&#8221; and &#8220;heavy handed&#8221; in his approach to the next two films. Regardless, a listen through the progression that the scores take from beginning to end make for  a body of work  that truly is a pleasure to listen through, no matter what side of the Zimmer fence you are on. Knowing that </span><i><b>TPOTC</b></i> was conceived by Disney to be a franchise, i<span id="intelliTXT">t is fascinating to hear how Zimmer carefully constructs each offering to be the foundation for the next.<br /></span><br /><span id="intelliTXT"><br /></span><br /><span id="intelliTXT">In terms of influence, perhaps the measuring rod of </span><i><b>TPOTC </b></i><span id="intelliTXT">is the standard it set of how  a score is now expected to &#8220;sound&#8221; as a final mix. The credit of Zimmer&#8217;s contribution to the world of filmscore differs from each person you talk to (from revered to repulsed!), but one thing everyone can probably agree on is that before Hans Zimmer film music sounded one way, and since Hans Zimmer&#8230; well, film music just sounds <i>different</i>. The question as to whether that influence has been good or bad for the film music industry is something that will probably be debated until we are all dead and buried and Disney is prepping the &#8220;The Pirates of the Caribbean</span> 50th Anniversary Limited Gold Platinum Silver Tin Foil Pirate Hat Edition&#8221;!<span id="intelliTXT"><br /></span></p>
<p>Why do you think Zimmer&#8217;s music for <i><b>TPOTC</b></i> was voted onto this list as being &#8220;influential&#8221;? How does it differ from other scores in the same genre in the last ten years? Does it compete with the work Hans has done for other projects in any way? Is it up to par with that work?</p>
<p>Most interestingly, how has the music of <i><b>TPOTC</b></i> affected your composing style or your thoughts on composing for picture? What other scores have you heard that are obviously influenced by <i><b>TPOTC</b></i>?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;"><b>#6 &#8211; THE MATRIX</b></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><b><i>(Don Davis)</i></b></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0204485/">Don Davis</a>&#8216; score to the 1999 science-fiction action film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/"><i><b>THE MATRIX</b></i></a> is a smartly constructed symphonic score that combines dark and light tones  to bring the Wachowski Brothers&#8217; vision of not-too-distant-future human enslavement to vivid life.</p>
<p>As a film, <i><b>THE MATRIX</b></i> was unique in that it came along at a time when cinema had become somewhat routine and static. The Wachowski&#8217;s set the movie-going audience on their head with the visuals and high-concept storyline of <i><b>THE MATRIX</b></i> and really upped the ante in terms of the Hollywood formula. Many films in the same genre are blatantly derivitive of <i><b>THE MATRIX</b></i> aesthetic, and a case could be made that Davis&#8217; music had a lot to do with that.</p>
<p>Scored for a large orchestra, and all but devoid of any electronic elements (the score was almost wholly acoustic while the source material handled the electronic vibe), <i><b>THE MATRIX</b></i> score revived many long-forgotten orchestral trends and re-introduced a certain grandeur to filmscore that had arguably been dormant since the late 1980&#8217;s. Davis, who writes pencil to paper, used a decidedly organic approach to his score and the details are &#8220;felt&#8221; in <i><b>THE MATRIX</b>&#8216;s</i> cinematic experience. Davis&#8217; leanings on atonal orchestral power might be THE theme for <i><b>THE MATRIX</b></i>, if there is one at all.</p>
<p>Since <i><b>THE MATRIX</b></i> braves such new territory  visually on so many groundbreaking levels, it is hard to ascertain just why Davis&#8217; score sticks with you as indelibly as it does. An obvious product of its own influences anyway, Davis&#8217; music for <i><b>THE MATRIX</b></i> contains elements made popular by the likes of franchise composers such as John Williams (STAR WARS), Danny Elfman (BATMAN), and John Barry (the BOND franchise), yet it carefully pays tribute to those scores without shamefully tipping its hat too far into out-and-out flattery. For example, Davis&#8217; repetitive use of dissonant brass clusters as a motivic device, while not in any way original, has caused that technique to enjoy somewhat of a  resurgence in contemporary scoring as of late. Similarly, his detailed string and woodwind &#8220;swirling&#8221; during the <i>Main Title</i> is now the go-to sound when a central character is &#8220;displaced&#8221; or &#8220;unstable&#8221; in a narrative action piece.</p>
<p>Why do you think Davis&#8217; music for <i><b>THE MATRIX</b></i> was voted onto this list as being &#8220;influential&#8221;? How does it differ from other scores in the same genre in the last ten years? Does it compete with the work Davis has done for other projects in any way? Is it up to par with that work?</p>
<p>Most interestingly, how has the music of <i><b>THE MATRIX</b></i> affected your composing style or your thoughts on composing in the same genre? What other scores have you heard that are obviously influenced by <i><b>THE MATRIX</b></i>?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SsWrmcu1UAI/AAAAAAAAAvI/ohD-Epb7yZ4/s1600-h/requiem1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SsWrmcu1UAI/AAAAAAAAAvI/ohD-Epb7yZ4/s200/requiem1.jpg" /></a><span style="font-size: small;"><b>#7 &#8211; REQUIEM FOR A DREAM</b></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><b><i>(Clint Mansell)</i></b></span></p>
<p>In 2000, while still a relatively unknown composer, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0543739/">Clint Mansell</a> struck gold with a minimalist score for his second collaboration with director Darren Aronofsky, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180093/"> <i><b>REQUIEM FOR A DREAM</b></i></a>.</p>
<p>Scored for only five musicians — the fabulous Kronos Quartet and Mansell himself on synthesizers — the music for Aronofsky&#8217;s dark cautionary tale is stark and angular, utilizing the decidedly Herrmannesque method of cold, non-vibrato string lines against rigid, spacial synth textures.</p>
<p>The main motif of the score is a simple three-chord progression that is used incessantly throughout the score, yet Mansell&#8217;s overuse of the progression only serves to drive home the emotional beating that the storyline itself provides.</p>
<p>As perhaps a testament to it&#8217;s influence on modern scoring techniques, one of the most memorable tracks from Mansell&#8217;s score is &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux_Aeterna_%28Requiem_for_a_Dream%29" title="Lux Aeterna (Requiem for a Dream)">Lux Aeterna</a>&#8220;, which has not only become a favored temp track in almost every Hollywood music editor&#8217;s playlist, but also has been used in countless forms of media including the television show &#8220;Lost&#8221; and the video game &#8220;Assassin&#8217;s Creed&#8221;. Over the years, <i><b>REQUIEM FOR A DREAM </b></i>has dominated as a go-to trailer music having been featured heavily in theatrical trailers for  &#8220;300&#8221;, &#8220;The DaVinci Code&#8221;, &#8220;Sunshine&#8221;, &#8220;Zathura&#8221;, and  dozens more.</p>
<p>Why do you think Mansell&#8217;s music for <i><b>REQUIEM FOR A DREAM</b></i><i><b></b></i> was voted onto this list as being &#8220;influential&#8221;? How does it differ from other scores in the same genre in the last ten years? Does it compete with the work Mansell has done for other projects in any way? Is it up to par with that work?</p>
<p>Most interestingly, how has the music of <i><b>REQUIEM FOR A DREAM</b></i><i><b></b></i> affected your composing style or your thoughts on composing in the same genre? What other scores have you heard that are obviously influenced by <i><b>REQUIEM FOR A DREAM</b></i><i><b></b></i>?</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SsTavBRDSqI/AAAAAAAAAvA/jvxkoh-gwoI/s1600-h/Bear+McCreary+-+Battlestar+Galactica+Season+1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SsTavBRDSqI/AAAAAAAAAvA/jvxkoh-gwoI/s200/Bear+McCreary+-+Battlestar+Galactica+Season+1.jpg" /></a></div>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><b>#8 &#8211; BATTLESTAR GALACTICA<i>&nbsp;</i></b></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><b><i>(Bear McCreary)</i></b></span></p>
<p>Our second entry on the list from the world of television comes from relative newcomer <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0566970/">Bear McCreary</a> and his truly memorable and highly conceptualized score for the the SyFy reboot of the classic series <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407362/"><i><b>BATTLESTAR GALACTICA</b></i></a>.</p>
<p>Credit goes to McCreary for  creating the feel of the show with music. In the early stages of conceptualization for the show, producers only gave him one directive: no themes. Beyond that, as has been widely publicized over the years, they were at a complete loss as to how the music should sound. Combining a blend of traditional orchestral elements, distorted and eBowed guitars, large format ethnic percussion, vocals, and synthesized textures, McCreary created a strong atmospheric world mix of styles and influences which features melodic references to Asian, Middle Eastern, and Irish music, among others — stylistically not what you would expect from a dirty, searing space opera.</p>
<p>As much as the series itself is a fresh journey over familiar territory, McCreary&#8217;s score provides the viewer with a new way to experience a world that we&#8217;ve seen some of before, yet make us fear the worst as if it was our first time to the &#8220;alien invasion&#8221; BBQ. The final fruit of his labors is music that eschews the usual science fiction pathos and brings to the screen a musically controlled chaos that feels fresh and new in the face of a well-worn genre. </p>
<p>Why do you think McCreary&#8217;s music for <i><b>BATTLESTAR GALACTICA</b></i> was voted onto this list as being &#8220;influential&#8221;? How does it differ from other scores in the same genre in the last ten years? Does it compete with the work McCreary has done for other projects in any way? Is it up to par with that work?</p>
<p>Most interestingly, how has the music of <i><b>BATTLESTAR GALACTICA</b></i> affected your composing style or your thoughts on composing in the same genre? What other scores have you heard that are obviously influenced by <i><b>BATTLESTAR GALACTICA</b></i>?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;"><b>#9 &#8211; THE DARK KNIGHT<i>&nbsp;</i></b></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><b><i>(Hans Zimmer &amp; James Newton-Howard)</i></b></span></p>
<p>Following the success of their collaboration for Christopher Nolan&#8217;s reboot of the Batman franchise <i>Batman Begins</i>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001877/">Hans Zimmer</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006133/">James Newton-Howard</a> reteamed in 2008 to score  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/"><i><b>THE DARK KNIGHT</b></i></a> — the decidedly darker follow-up  fueled almost single-handedly by Heath Ledger&#8217;s iconic performance as &#8220;The Joker&#8221;.</p>
<p>At first, what seemed like an odd pairing turned out to be one of the most effective once Zimmer and Newton-Howard unleashed their <i>Batman Begins</i> score on the world in 2005. But what followed for Round 2 from the duo was a complete about-face from <i>Batman Begins</i>.  <i><b>THE DARK KNIGHT</b></i> boasted a tone all its own that traversed a darker and much more visceral soundscape, utilizing string and brass effects combined with electronic elements to bring edge and power to the series. In addition, Newton-Howard&#8217;s emotional themes lifted the story to more dramatic heights than it&#8217;s predecessor, providing more of an intimate look into the heart of Bruce Wayne. </p>
<p>Without saying too much and risk giving away some great debate points, we&#8217;ll conclude by reminding everyone that ultimately, this was the score that brought to the surface the long-debated Zimmer practice of doling out additional music credits amongst his team, thus costing he and Newton-Howard an Oscar nomination, according to then Academy rules regarding the number of names on cue sheets. Then, in typical Academy fashion, the committee reversed its own rule and allowed the nomination for the score.</p>
<p>Why is Zimmer and Newton-Howard&#8217;s music for <i><b>THE DARK KNIGHT</b></i> so influential? How does it differ from other scores in the same genre  in the last ten years? Does it compete with the work the two have done for other feature films in any way? Is it up to par with that work?</p>
<p>Most interestingly, how has the music of <i><b>THE DARK KNIGHT</b></i> affected your composing style or your thoughts on composing in the same genre? What other scores have you heard that are obviously influenced by <i><b>THE DARK KNIGHT</b></i>?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;"><b>#10 &#8211; LOST</b></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><b><i>(Michael Giacchino)</i></b></span></p>
<p>Since its debut on September 22, 2004, ABC&#8217;s &#8220;<i><b><a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411008/" rel="imdb" title="Lost (TV series)">LOST</a></b></i>&#8221; has created a niche trend in dramatic television and has been responsible in many ways for pushing the envelope of the power of cinematic television. Created by <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0009190/" rel="imdb" title="J. J. Abrams">J.J. Abrams</a> <i>(Alias, Mission Impossible III, Star Trek)</i>, the show centers around a group of people who survive a plane crash on a deserted island. That&#8217;s the short version&#8230; the long version is an engrossing tale of supernatural events, intertwining destinies, and chance happenings, all mixed together in a carefully crafted series that is still running strong on weekly primetime.</p>
<p>From the start, it was clear that the music for <i><b>LOST</b></i>, composed by frequent Abrams collaborator <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0315974/" rel="imdb" title="Michael Giacchino">Michael Giacchino</a>, is as carefully constructed and thought out as the show itself. With music written in &#8220;linear&#8221; fashion, Giacchino has developed his musical characteristics for <i><b>LOST</b></i> by slowly stirring the plot lines to a calm boil. He has also chosen to score the show with a live orchestra (a rarity in this day and age), but an interesting twist on a live orchestra at that (see video below for a tour through a LOST scoring session).</p>
<p>Why is Giacchino&#8217;s music for <i><b>LOST</b></i> so influential? How does it differ from other scores that have been written in the last ten years for television, AND&#8230; does it compete with the work he has done for feature film in any way? Is it up to par with that work?</p>
<p>Most interestingly, how has the music of <i><b>LOST</b></i> affected your composing style or your thoughts on composing in the same genre? What other shows or scores have you heard that are obviously influenced by <i><b>LOST</b></i>?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s here your ideas in the COMMENTS!</p>

<p>It has been said that the last ten years have been some of the worst for film music. And while it might be true that since 1999, film music has failed to produce an  indelible theme (some in our industry have argued the case that the last truly &#8220;memorable&#8221; theme in film music belongs to James Horner&#8217;s <i>Titanic</i>, released in 1997), film music, like all music, is highly subjective and does not lend itself well to such indictments.</p>
<p>That being said, there have been over 12,200 studio films released in the USA alone since 1999, and almost all of them had a score. We here at SCOREcast want to know what <i><b>YOU</b></i> think about film music over the last ten years. What have been the most memorable and influential scores that have popped up since 1999? Why were they memorable? What was it about each one that left an impression on you? What sorts of trends or &#8220;gimmicks&#8221; do you think were born of these scores? Where was the bar <i>raised</i> these last ten years? Where was the ball <i>dropped</i>?</p>
<p>Now remember — these are not (necessarily) the BEST scores of the past decade, but instead the ones you feel have had the most influence both on composers and/or listeners. Good or bad, these scores were big in that they defined something memorable and left a mark on the craft after they left theaters to rest for eternity in that big Blockbuster Video in the sky!<br /><b><br />Here&#8217;s What to Do:</b><br /><i>Go to the COMMENTS section below and tell us what your Top 10 Most Influential Scores of the Past Decade are. Don&#8217;t be shy&#8230; there are no wrong answers, and everyone&#8217;s will most surely be different. For now, just give us your list, numbered 1 to 10, in no particular order. We will then compile the master list and present our findings to you in a week-long series starting next Tuesday morning.</i><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SrpIm8-276I/AAAAAAAAAuY/a4VOaHWklMQ/s1600-h/posters_of_decade.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SrpIm8-276I/AAAAAAAAAuY/a4VOaHWklMQ/s320/posters_of_decade.jpg" /></a><br />Along with the master list, we will present commentary and discussion from your favorite SCOREcast columnists featuring discussion on what made these scores so memorable, why they are knocked as much as they are praised, whether they are more known for their accompanying films or for their musical content, the form and function of these scores, as well as much, much more&#8230;</p>
