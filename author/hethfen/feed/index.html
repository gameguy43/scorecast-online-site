		<description><![CDATA[Attention spans are short and very demanding. If you want to make your art into a business, you have to brand yourself and then market your art. No getting away from it.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For some reason, we creative types seem to take an instant dislike to the notion of Branding and Marketing.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t be quantified or packaged. We&#8217;re artists, darling. Our art speaks for itself. All true&#8230; but all the art out there is vying equally for all of your potential clients&#8217; attentions. And those attention spans are short and very demanding. If you want to make your art into a business, i.e. make money at it, you&#8217;ve no choice &#8211; you have to brand yourself and then market your art. No getting away from it.</p>
<p>And as film composers and sound designers, we&#8217;re usually selling art that&#8217;s <em>yet to be created</em>. So what might be a more effective overall marketing strategy is to think of how we can sell ourselves, our persona, our fun-to-work-with-ness, our attitudes to career and life, how you and I collaborating together will without a doubt create something more awesome than we could possibly have done separately.</p>
<p>So marketing is very important to the film music composer or sound designer. But it need not be boring, time-consuming or expensive. Marketing for us film sound creators can be quick, easy, painless, fun, interesting, and very cheap if you take a little time to think creatively about it. Even if you&#8217;re totally anti-marketing/branding/selling your soul, you&#8217;re probably doing some of it already without even realising it (I&#8217;ve talked about some of this in <em><a href="../../../2010/06/heather-fenoughty-personality-branding.html"><strong>Personality Branding</strong></a></em>).</p>
<p><strong>And</strong>&#8230; if it sells more of your work or your services, what you complainin&#8217; about? <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Here are all of the ways I can think of (so far) that a film music composer may market themselves. I&#8217;ve separated them out into whether I&#8217;ve used them or not, and how useful they&#8217;ve been up &#8217;til now. Hopefully you can pick out a few to start forming an easy strategy for marketing your wares and yourself.</p>
<p>This turned into rather a long list so stick with it&#8230;</p>
<h1>Marketing Stuff that really works &#8211; directly led to sales:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Online portfolio website with music and contact details</li>
<li>DVD Showreel ready to go upon request</li>
<li>Tailored CD submissions</li>
<li>Music licensing on other site which led to commissions</li>
<li>Content marketing (fancy name for blog attached to website): writing blog posts about opinions and thoughts about my experiences. This is all about building a connection with audience, fleshing out a more thorough picture of yourself, what you&#8217;re like as a person to work with rather than just a faceless, personality-less, unknown quantity.</li>
<li>Networking in person and seeing it as an opportunity to make connections for people with other people.</li>
<li>Having an elevator pitch ready to go&#8230; then getting out of the way, asking questions, listening, really engaging in creating the potential for a new business relationship.</li>
<li>Twitter for both forging new relationships and developing ones already made through other methods.</li>
<li>Maintaining and keeping tabs on pre-made business relationships on Facebook.</li>
<li>Word of Mouth recommendations from people you&#8217;ve worked with before. Isn&#8217;t as tricky as you might first think &#8211; be easy to work with, go above and beyond, add value, and make the client feel special (&#8216;cos they are &#8211; they&#8217;re working with you aren&#8217;t they?).</li>
<li>Working in associated roles &#8211; this is really a form of networking. The word-of-mouth that you can gain about you being a really cool person and being great to work with works wonders when you hear about new projects coming up and you offer music composition/sound design!</li>
<li>Collaborating with other artists in relevant areas for free or as equally paid co-creators in order to raise both of our profiles.</li>
<li>Doing really awesome work with awesome people on awesome shows with high profile venues/channels with massive audiences is worth its weight in gold (though this probably counts a word of mouth too).</li>
<li>Giving away free CDs of pre-composed music to trusted filmmakers to license whenever they might like to in the future. Sometimes they&#8217;ll come back to you for a bespoke version or even a new commission.</li>
<li>Participating on relevant trade forums.</li>
<li>Sending showreel CDs out to local and national production companies. I actually did this without checking whether they wanted to hear it first, tut tut. Even though it worked for me, right at the start of my career when I was a little fraidy-cat when it came to cold calling, it was such a small response &#8211; 3 replies from 100+ CDs sent out &#8211; that really, I spent an awful lot of money that could have been saved just by making a few phone calls. Though you never know&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<h1>Marketing stuff that probably worked indirectly, though I don&#8217;t know for sure, or methods I&#8217;ve implemented so recently that&#8217;s it&#8217;s hard to say what effect it&#8217;s yet to have:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Website SEO (search engine optimisation)</li>
<li>Building a website with a CMS or &#8216;Content Management System&#8217; (e.g. wordpress, joomla) that&#8217;s very easily update-able with news, presents a more unified site where the blog isn&#8217;t just an add on, and where you don&#8217;t need to go into the code to make site-wide changes.</li>
<li>Asking for testimonials for your website &#8211; also reminds the client how great it was working with you. <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </li>
<li>Following up with email note after networking meetings (&#8216;great to meet you&#8217; type stuff).</li>
<li>Business cards handed out at networking events and included in showreel mailouts.</li>
<li>Trade press and general newspaper interviews.</li>
<li>Relevant website interviews.</li>
<li>Writing articles for relevant websites (such as this one).</li>
<li>Email signature including links to my latest work on- or off-line.</li>
<li>Twitter-driven traffic to my website &#8211; these visitors tend to stay around on the website a little longer than the average.</li>
<li>Scheduling tweets for Twitter to maintain a more consistent, steady online presence and reach more followers in all the different timezones.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong><br />
</strong>Marketing stuff I&#8217;ve tried that hasn&#8217;t worked for me so far (but might for you&#8230; but it&#8217;s dubious, and if you don&#8217;t have time or money or energy, then maybe don&#8217;t bother):</h1>
<ul>
<li>Private online music store selling mp3s and music licenses for media attached to my website.</li>
<li>A website built on flash &#8211; very little search engine traffic at all as most of it can&#8217;t be indexed.</li>
<li>&#8220;Faking it &#8217;til you make it&#8221;/exaggerating your achievements/pretending to be something you&#8217;re not personality-wise &#8211; you get found out eventually! It&#8217;s so tiring to keep up the facade consistently.</li>
<li>Following general marketing gurus and social media &#8216;experts&#8217; on Twitter.</li>
<li>Following lots and lots of people on Twitter &#8211; signal to noise ratio gets less and less favourable, even though your follow stats are high. They aren&#8217;t really a targeted audience.</li>
<li>Premium, i.e. paid-for, online portfolio/cv sites &#8211; e.g. Productionbase</li>
<li>&#8220;Working the Room&#8221; at industry networking events &#8211; no real, viable relationships formed as a result of constantly looking for instant &#8216;usefulness&#8217; indicators in conversations, looking over shoulders at other people who might be more &#8216;useful.&#8221; This behavior doesn&#8217;t really give the best impression.</li>
<li>Music &#8220;giveaways.&#8221; I tried this once and it didn&#8217;t work&#8230; but it might next time.</li>
<li>Myspace page (although I didn&#8217;t put a lot of effort into it)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Stuff I haven&#8217;t tried yet so can&#8217;t say either way. But these tips might send your business into the stratosphere, so am not ruling them out yet:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Professional logo design.</li>
<li>Headshots/professional photography (technically I have but it was for a different business &#8211; a live string group &#8211; and wasn&#8217;t really the right style for what I wanted to promote for my freelance composition).</li>
<li>Professional web design.</li>
<li>Hired professional PR and marketing services.</li>
<li>Email list marketing (round-robins, news updates)</li>
<li>Using bookmarking sites and comments on other blogs to drive traffic to my site (not intentionally anyway)</li>
<li>Paid-for ghostwriters for blog content.</li>
<li>Paid advertisements &#8211; e.g. Telephone directories on and offline, in trade magazines, on relevant trade websites.</li>
<li>Real-world thank you notes (vs email, which I actually do quite a lot).</li>
<li>Professionally printed branded headed note paper, &#8216;with compliments&#8217; slips, holiday cards etc.</li>
<li>Pursuing the press e.g. having a press pack ready, calling the press with a pre-made story or angle.</li>
<li>Video interviews/vlog (e.g. on your blog).</li>
<li>Branded associated merchandise &#8211; hats, cups, tshirts, bags, stuffed animals&#8230;</li>
<li>Reverbnation page (technically I&#8217;ve got a page. but I&#8217;ve not put anything of interest on it. So can&#8217;t really claim to be an authority on this one)</li>
<li>Publicity &#8220;stunts.&#8221;</li>
<li>Cold-calling production companies. (I take the easy route and ask my working friends and colleagues who I&#8217;ve met through networking or working alongside in related media who work at those companies, what&#8217;s going on there. So, technically, it&#8217;s warm-calling).</li>
</ul>
<h1>Final word &#8211; and this is as technical as I&#8217;m going to get&#8230;</h1>
<p>As media composers and sound designers, we are B2B &#8211; business to business &#8211; rather than B2C &#8211; business to consumer. We sell our services or our previously composed music to producers of other media as raw material for them to sculpt into the product that will be sold to the consumer &#8211; the audience. So a lot of the advice for marketing for musicians you may find on the web or offline, unless specifically for media music composers and sound designers, isn&#8217;t actually that relevant.</p>
<p>Ultimately, rather than focussing on the product, we&#8217;re aiming to be service providers &#8211; you&#8217;re selling you: your working personality, your style of collaboration, your creativity-on-tap. You can&#8217;t really afford to just let the music &#8216;speak for itself&#8217;. That&#8217;s your past. What you&#8217;re selling is in your future. Who you are as an artist. Your creative soul.</p>
<p>If that doesn&#8217;t scare you then you&#8217;re probably in the right business. Go get &#8216;em, tiger.</p>

It&#8217;s the calm between storms, if you will. One of the things I&#8217;ve been mulling over and considering is business development and branding. After all, my freelance work is a business, and it deserves the same care and attention as any business to grow and become more profitable.</p>
<p>Through this process, I&#8217;ve become fascinated with the  &#8216;Myers-Briggs&#8217; test. There are loads of different kinds of personality tests out there, but this is the one I&#8217;ve found the most useful and accurate for how I approach life and, more importantly, the business of scoring picture.</p>
<p>In the most basic sense, it describes you as the kind of person who gets their kicks from jamming with other people, or from kicking your brain into high gear on your own to solve problems; if you live in the &#8216;now&#8217; or if you&#8217;re constantly plotting for the future; if you&#8217;re details- or big-picture-oriented; and if you&#8217;re ruled by your heart or your head.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s more interesting is how the different bits of your personality come together to create something greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes2.asp">The test is here</a>. (There are others out there. Google it if you want to try it a few times. If you&#8217;re that way inclined… that probably means you&#8217;re an xSTx)</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve got your type, go <a href="http://www.personalitypage.com/html/portraits.html">here</a> to get a summary of your traits, and let us know in the comments if you feel it&#8217;s an accurate portrayal of yourself…</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an INTJ &#8211; also called a mastermind! I&#8217;ll plot and plan and scheme until a solution to any problem is reached, or any system I&#8217;ve created is the most efficient and fit for purpose it can be. And woe betide anyone who crosses paths with me and doesn&#8217;t live up to these high standards of efficiency and reliability. I&#8217;m focussed on the details, the intricacies. This counts for both music and life. I know where I want to go and can tell you exactly how I&#8217;m gonna get there… and if I don&#8217;t, give me a little while to mull it over, and I&#8217;ll come back with a point-by-point plan. Colour-coded. With graphs and projections (if there&#8217;s time and it&#8217;s the most efficient way of conveying the information, of course).</p>
<p>So all this self-analysis is very interesting (unless your an ESFJ, in which case it may not be your cup of tea) but it&#8217;s all a little on the self-indulgent side if there&#8217;s no real-world application for it.</p>
<p>As with all these personality typing tests, there&#8217;s an accompanying list of &#8216;ideal&#8217; jobs per type. Take this with a pinch of salt (unless you&#8217;re an xSFP), and instead see how your natural strengths can compliment your chosen line of work… and how your less-than-useful traits can be &#8216;hacked&#8217; or worked around.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll use myself as an example, and forgive me for hogging the limelight. (As an INxx, you now know how much I dislike this <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />  )</p>
<p>I&#8217;m detailed, organised, efficient, reliable, solutions-oriented = working with me is easy as I&#8217;ll always deliver on time to the utmost of my abilities, cover all possible contingencies, and not waste budget on pointless extra bells and whistles that you don&#8217;t need.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m introverted = O-oh. You&#8217;d think this was a weakness in our business of &#8216;it&#8217;s-who-you-know-not-what-you-know&#8217;. Walking into a crowded room of people I&#8217;ve never met with the express purpose of networking is not my idea of fun. I would imagine there are a few readers who are with me on that. But I&#8217;ve developed &#8216;hacks&#8217;. I like to get to the nitty-gritty of a person, to understand them, when chatting one-on-one. Small talk is neither one of my strengths nor useful to me in forming relationships with people, but I do like to know what makes them tick &#8211; what are their values, their long term goals in life, do they like sci-fi (this is actually the litmus test for getting on with me <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />  ).</p>
<p>So I <em>don&#8217;t</em> work the room. I can&#8217;t, I&#8217;m not made that way. Why fight it &#8211; it&#8217;s not the most efficient way to proceed.</p>
<p>So, at a networking event, there is no time limit on my discussions with you. I won&#8217;t sell myself to you, but instead I&#8217;ll find connections for you with the people I know… because that&#8217;s the most efficient way of making that room of people, that potential <em>system</em>, work… and in the end, that&#8217;s the best way for me to find business opportunities &#8211; seeking out teams of people that collaborate so well together that they effortlessly create fabulous films or projects that are a delight to score. That&#8217;s the theory anyway, and it seems to be going ok in practise so far…</p>
<p>One of the strangest things I discovered in doing this is that I&#8217;m a T (Thinker), not an F (Feeler). Life and business is run by my frontal lobe (head), not my endocrine system (heart). Whilst this is awesomely useful from a business-entrepreneurial point of view, I&#8217;ve chosen the <em>business of emotion</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a music composer, a crystalliser of feeling, a reality-maker of emotion. Conflict of interests, n&#8217;est-ce pas?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still working this out to be honest. I can reduce most of the emotional quality of a piece of score to it&#8217;s rational, practical music theory. Is it this process of analysis that allows me to synthesise a score back into that emotion at the required time for picture? Is it my dispassionate nature that allows objectivity, a &#8216;thick skin&#8217;, when it comes to criticism of my work from my clients and collaborators? Is it that I see all my work as a business so that I&#8217;m actually ok selling my creations and don&#8217;t really mind that much if an editor trims and loops it here and there to fit with a new picture cut?</p>
<p>All I know is that when a piece of music moves me, there must be something seriously useful to learn from it, since it got through all those layers of logic and reason!  Which immediately prompts analysis and filing away in the &#8216;locus of cool&#8217;. With colour coding.</p>

<p><strong>——————</strong></p>
<p>A pro is someone who gets paid for what they do, pure and simple.</p>
<p>Compare this with the opposite, the definition of an amateur, who does the same thing only for the love of it (i.e. for free).</p>
<p>As soon as you get paid, you can legitimately call yourself a professional. A &#8216;Pro&#8217;.</p>
<p>But, ultimately, only by <em>being professional</em> can you get to this point <em>and stay there</em>.</p>
<p>A roundup of the qualities of the Pro Film Music Composer (by no means exhaustive!) follows…</p>
<p><strong>1.  It&#8217;s business, not a hobby</strong><br />
If you&#8217;re in this business as a pro, then you&#8217;re a businessman/woman. That means working regularly, persistently on not only your music but <em>on</em> your business.</p>
<p>Get your affairs in order: tax, insurance, working environment, legal requirements. You&#8217;re in this game to sell your music, to get paid for composing.</p>
<p><strong>2.  Be an expert</strong><br />
Educate yourself in composition, musical styles, and methods of collaboration and delivery.</p>
<p>Keep your knowledge up-to-date with new technological innovations, musical trends, media language, etc. Have an <em>informed</em> opinion.</p>
<p>Note: this does not mean jumping on the bandwagon/keeping-up-with-the-Jones&#8217; by buying every new piece of technology that comes out. This does mean knowing what&#8217;s new, what it can do, and what it may or may not be able to do for you now and in the future.</p>
<p><strong>3.  Be objective</strong><br />
You&#8217;re creating raw materials for someone else to manipulate, not a completely finished, final product. Don&#8217;t get precious.</p>
<p>Accept criticism graciously.  It&#8217;s not personal; even when it seems like it is. <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>4.  Pro-actively research and create opportunities</strong><br />
Use downtime between gigs to update your showreel, website and promotional materials — you never know when you&#8217;ll get asked for them.</p>
<p>Seek out new contacts and build relationships; plan ahead, refine your business systems, identify potential new opportunities in the making, and then <em>go after them</em>.</p>
<p><strong>5.  Invest in your business</strong><br />
Invest <em>time</em> in your education, your experience, and in building relationships with potential clients.</p>
<p>Invest <em>money</em> in equipment — the right tool for the right job — and, again, in your education, both in your skills and in running a business.</p>
<p>Invest <em>energy</em>: this isn&#8217;t a job you can just fall into. It takes focus, motivation, persistence and courage. Get on and do it already.</p>
<p>Invest in your <em>team</em> and build support networks for streams of advice and leads on sources of work, and identify potential assistants and colleagues that can bring complementary skills when you might need them. Build your team in advance to save essential writing time when that call finally does come through.</p>
<p><strong>6.  Take responsibility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be responsible for your business; you know you&#8217;ve no-one to hold accountable but yourself.</li>
<li>Act professionally: deliver on time; be courteous, civilised, and amiable to work with, yet focused; be prepared for any and all contingencies you reasonably can be; learn from past mistakes and plan for future successes.</li>
</ul>
<p>So whilst being paid for a gig defines you in the moment as a &#8216;Pro&#8217;, <em>being</em> a Pro will more importantly get you to that point and give you the best shot at <em>staying</em> Pro!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-356" href="../../../2010/04/heather-fenoughty-acknowledge-your.html/sig-fenoughty"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-356" title="sig-fenoughty" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sig-fenoughty.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>I cannot emphasize enough how incredibly important it is to acknowledge your success in creating, to completion and delivery, a musical score. </span>This music that you have produced is an integral part of the film, show, game or whatever project it is. It could not exist in its current form without your efforts.</p>
<div>For the sake of your growth as a composer, sound designer, or other post-production professionals, you must underline the importance to your own psyche that this is a moment to be emphasized and cherished, that it is something desirable &#8211; and so to be repeated.</div>
<div>How often have you actually gotten to the stage of delivery in all of your projects? As Lee said in <a href="../../../2010/04/delivery-finaling-and-changing-world.html">this post</a>, it&#8217;s never a done deal that the project will complete and you&#8217;ll be able to get to that all-important stage of delivering your musical opus. So when you do get there… celebrate!</div>
<p><span id="more-297"></span></p>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"> </span><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="font-family: inherit;">Reap the Rewards</span></strong> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Reward yourself &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t have to be expensive, it doesn&#8217;t have to mean going on vacation for 3 months, but it must be significant. </span></span></div>
<div>You want to spend a day reading that book you never have time to get around to? Do it, and enjoy it, and banish any feelings of guilt that you should instead be working on something else!</div>
<div>Go out for a meal, go sit in the park, by the beach, catch up with friends over a coffee. For a certain length of time, be it a week, a day, or even just a few hours, get a change of scenery or schedule and just have fun.</div>
<div>Reward your family and friends, the ones that stuck by you when you were working long hours, the ones that made sure you ate properly and kept the roof over your head whilst you were waiting for the installments to come through, those who had their ears bent whilst you whined about how the project may not have been going to plan or you were having a tough time with a colleague.</div>
<div>You know who they are. Let them know that they&#8217;re appreciated and that they had a significant hand in you achieving this success &#8211; and that they get rewarded too!</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Space and Time</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The importance of stepping back and allowing a little space and time to reflect on the processes and experiences you&#8217;ve gone through to reach the success of delivering cannot be overstated.</span></span></div>
<div><a href="../../../2010/04/weekend-provocation-post-mortem-edition.html">Lee&#8217;s post on the &#8216;Post-Mortem&#8217; process</a> illustrates this very effectively: check what went wrong, system-wise and operationally, select material for demo versions and samples, paperwork and admin updates, thanking people who helped get the project to this stage.</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gratitude</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">I think the point Lee mentions at the end is possibly the most significant in the long run: Gratitude. Being thankful to yourself that you worked hard to get to this point in the project &#8211; that delivering a finished, finalized score is no mean feat &#8211; is essential. </span></span></div>
<div>You have the skills and the talent to achieve something great, possibly life-changing but at least enjoyable for those that hear and experience the project, whatever form it takes. Acknowledge this.</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recharge Your Creative Batteries</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Going from one project to the next without a period of time to recharge can be dangerous. Creative burnout is a serious issue for those of us working in the creative industries, not least because the creative value we produce is our source of money! </span></span></div>
<div>Having a temporal buffer between projects is essential not only for the reward and analysis procedures already mentioned, but for recharging your creative batteries. Get some distance from the music and sound themes of the project just delivered, or risk inadvertently re-hashing those themes and ideas for the next gig.</div>
<div>You need time to let those ideas go and to get prepared for the excitement of new themes, textures and colors that will come to you, given that chance.</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Accept Compliments Gracefully</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Finally, in acknowledging your own achievement in delivering an awesome score on schedule in an organized and professional manner… you must also learn to notice and accept the compliments and acknowledgments of others! If someone praises your work, say thank you! Do not put down the achievement with, &#8216;it was nothing,&#8217; or other such self-effacing statements. </span></span></div>
<div>You know as well as I do: it certainly was not nothing.</div>
<div><span style="font-family: inherit;">By acknowledging success and accepting compliments graciously, you will build confidence in your abilities and improve your self-esteem, which will ultimately mean the improvement of you as a composer.</span> <span style="font-family: inherit;">You&#8217;ll be more assured of your skills and potential, will have more faith in your own ideas and opinions about the use of music and sound in film.</span></div>
<div>Rather than staying within the safety and security of &#8216;what works&#8217;, you&#8217;ll be more willing to take the risks required to create something genuinely brilliant and different next time.</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">In conclusion&#8230;</span></div>
<div>Having the time and space to reflect is no luxury. It is an essential part of the process, a tool not only to analyze and correct any problems, but to gratefully accept the success that you&#8217;ve achieved in delivering this score.</div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Ultimately, it will only make you a stronger and better prepared for the next gig!</span></span></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sig-fenoughty.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-553" title="sig-fenoughty" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sig-fenoughty.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>This has been a fascinating month of articles on the ins, outs, technicalities, principles and importance of music spotting. It&#8217;s fair to say that the spotting session is an essential part of the music composition process, without which it is virtually impossible to stay in line &#8211; in sync &#8211; with the director&#8217;s vision for the film.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been lots of useful, insider&#8217;s info about how spotting sessions apply in the world of big-budget, LA Studio films &#8211; but the principles are equally applicable to micro-budget, small-scale, shorts, documentaries, commercials, multimedia and web applications, games… even wedding videos! Hey, you gotta get experience somewhere. <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>On, say, shorts and low-budget documentaries, or on projects where the schedule is ongoing, you may be tempted not to do a spotting session. You want to just dive in and play it by ear.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The director may ask you for your overall opinion on the style and tone of the film then just want to leave you to it.</p>
<p>The creative team may have even been with the film so long that they&#8217;re completely fed up with it, and just want it finished!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been brought on to the production very late in the day, the director (and others like the producer, editor, executives) may have made all the creative decisions already and could be extremely specific about the musical quality of each scene, even presenting you with a cue plot of sorts.</p>
<p><em>You can see this as a good thing &#8211; they care about the film and the effect of the music on the story. Remember, however, your role as musical expert, your opinion is valid and your objective pair of eyes may be the breath of fresh air the project needs to take it to the next level.</em></p>
<p>Worst case scenario: they may send you the film with the temp score and tell you to follow it precisely for position, style and tone, relegating you, in effect, to the level of technician rather than the creative equal that you signed on to be.</p>
<p>But it is just as important to treat these lower-budget or short films with the same respect as their bigger-budget counterparts &#8211; not only for the experience you gain that will put you in good stead for more expensive projects &#8211; but to make the best possible music for this film.</p>
<p>Hopefully preliminary meetings will have meant that you and the director have developed a common vocabulary, an understanding of each others creative styles and an appreciation for the unique qualities that each will be bringing to the table.</p>
<p>In preparation you will have seen the film and already developed your ideas and questions about the overall piece and individual scenes, even moments.</p>
<p>The spotting session may indeed be the first time you&#8217;ve actually met in person, and if you&#8217;re in with a newbie or inexperienced director it&#8217;s important to spell out the plan of attack for this meeting, what you need from the director to proceed, to enable them to ask questions and really have a creative dialogue as equals. Outline the agenda to make sure that the meeting is both efficient, thorough and effective.</p>
<div>Steer the conversation towards tone, pace and emotional journey and away from musical specifics such as key, musical themes and instrumentation.</p>
<p>If you really can&#8217;t get the director in the room with you for whatever reason (or on Skype, so you can see his facial expressions and body language), do the spotting session yourself as a backup/contingency/plan of last resort and get approval for every cue from the director by sending your beautifully organised cue plot and asking for notes if necessary on each one.</p>
<p>Flag up any different options for each scene if they exist &#8211; and they will &#8211; and then schedule a phone call so that you can discuss and thrash out the specifics.</p>
<p>Once the meeting has been had and all parties have come to an agreement on how the music will enhance, elaborate, advance or even juxtapose every onscreen element, get those notes typed up as soon as possible and emailed to every interested party (could just be the director, but it is also worth adding in the editor(s) and the producer)</p>
<p>Keeping everyone in sync and in the loop allows all parties to relax in the knowledge that you&#8217;re organized, efficient and including all of their creative input in your musical creations. Nobody has to mind-read or worry that you&#8217;re going off in a bizarre direction. It&#8217;s all down on paper.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s also so important for your peace of mind. The cue plot is a clear framework &#8211; your road map &#8211; to creating the best score you can. You don&#8217;t need to worry that you&#8217;re wandering down musical blind alleys or dead-ends.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a clear agreement between you and the director &#8211; if minds are changed later down the line as to the direction or purpose of a cue, you&#8217;re now in a solid position to think about renegotiating your schedule, fee, or whatever form of compensation you&#8217;re receiving.</p>
<p>Without it, you&#8217;re stuck with the original timeframe for delivery, you&#8217;re at the mercy of the director changing his mind on a whim, and you&#8217;re stealing time from composing other cues to correct these &#8216;mistakes&#8217;.</p>
<p>This will inevitably lead to a sub-par score, the creative disappointment and stress you&#8217;ll experience, the poor word-of-mouth that will inevitably transpire. A complete waste of time.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t put yourself through this. Do a spotting session. And do it right. <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

By finding a niche and hanging out your wares, you&#8217;ll effectively reduce your competition from other composers, and by being an excellent chap to work with you&#8217;ll be inundated (!) with repeat business.</p>
<div><em>But there will be times when you just gotta knuckle down and compete to get the gig.</em></p>
<div>I, as a person, am not particularly competitive. Inherently, I&#8217;m more interested in the collaboration side of this job &#8211; I think that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re all at this crazy game, no?</div>
<div>I&#8217;ve somehow managed to get away with competing no more than 4 times for a gig (that I can remember… maybe I blanked the rest of the times out…). Read on to find out how they turned out (save for the most recent &#8211; I&#8217;ll let you know when they get back to me) and what lessons there&#8217;s to be learned.</div>
<div><a name="more"></a></div>
<div>I&#8217;m seriously grateful that in most of my work I&#8217;ve been kept busy with commissions from repeat business and word-of-mouth recommendations. I put this down to <em>finding my niche</em>.</div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><span class="hw" style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">niche</span> <object style="margin: 1px;" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="13" height="21" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><embed style="margin: 1px;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="13" height="21"></embed></object> <span class="pron" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #809e83; cursor: pointer;" onclick="pron_key()" onmouseover="return m_over('Click for pronunciation key')" onmouseout="m_out()">(n<img src="http://img.tfd.com/hm/GIF/ibreve.gif" alt="" align="absbottom" />ch, n<img src="http://img.tfd.com/hm/GIF/emacr.gif" alt="" align="absbottom" />sh)</span></span></p>
<div class="pseg"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><em>n.</em></span></p>
<div class="ds-list" style="margin-left: 1cm;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><strong>1. </strong>A recess in a wall, as for holding a statue or urn.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><strong>b. A special area of demand for a product or service</strong></span></p>
<div class="sds-list" style="margin-left: 1cm;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><span style="color: #226699;"><em><br />
</em></span></span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"> </span></p>
</div>
<div>Looking back, it wasn&#8217;t a conscious decision, I don&#8217;t think. It just kind of happened while I was focussing on getting any and all composing and sound design work I could possibly find.</div>
<div>I have a composing niche. It&#8217;s orchestral, created with samples and often has a contemporary vibe, somehow. There&#8217;s usually a quirky or dark flavour to it.</div>
<div>Though to be fair, I don&#8217;t think I can call this a niche. It&#8217;s more like 50-90% of the film composers&#8217; style out there&#8230; so that can&#8217;t be it what&#8217;s making me more attractive to clients.</div>
<div>I also have a geographical niche. Even though it&#8217;s the fourth largest city in England, few people have heard of Sheffield, my base in the UK. There&#8217;s a grassroots film and a reasonably successful television industry in the region… but there are so few composers here, I really have cleaned up.</div>
<div>I suppose I might consider that I have a personality niche. I&#8217;m uber-reliable, never miss a deadline (to date!), unusually objective towards my creations&#8230; sometimes it&#8217;s a rare quality in this line of work.</div>
<div>I do rather wonder if being a female composer has helped rather than hindered my career &#8211; maybe there&#8217;s an element of novelty value there?</div>
<div>So, back to pitching. The first time I pitched for a gig, it was an unpaid feature. I was fresh out of postgrad college and needed to get a credit and some showreel fodder urgently. I beat 40 other composers, wuh yeah! … but I think I had an unfair advantage at that level, and it was pretty much a done deal that I&#8217;d win. It was unpaid, and a student film too. I figured after the fact that not many composers with my experience, training and skill would probably go for a gig like that.</div>
<div>Moral of the tale &#8211; shoot low.</div>
<div>My god, that&#8217;s awful advice, that can&#8217;t be right.</div>
<div>Perhaps rather it should be… be better than the competition! But what does &#8216;better&#8217; mean. Let us know your thoughts in the Comments below.</div>
<div>The second time I pitched, I didn&#8217;t get the gig. There were two other composers in the running, and the best man won, to be fair. The pitch was very specific and precise, and I twisted it a little to suit my style, skills and gear. I had a few redrafts too after feedback, which meant I got closer to the desired product, a luxury not usually afforded to pitching composers. I think I was treated better since I&#8217;d worked with the director before and he was in my corner!</div>
<div>When I heard the music on the show though, I realised why I didn&#8217;t get the gig. They wanted Tibetan vocals and ethnic instruments with a very, intimate, human edge, and I&#8217;d given them music better suited to epic panoramas on a nature show. Oops.</div>
<div>At the time, I was pretty gutted &#8211; I&#8217;d assumed that since they&#8217;d come to me first and that the director wanted to work with me again that it was a done deal.</div>
<div>Trust me, it&#8217;s <em>never</em> a done deal &#8217;til the fat lady sings.</div>
<div>Morals of the tale:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>If the client has been very specific, really do follow that brief, to the letter. If they&#8217;ve come to you with the offer to pitch, they obviously know your stuff already. No need to do more of the same. Be as accurate as you can.</li>
<li>Never assume you&#8217;ve got the gig simply because you have an awesome working relationship with the director/producer/editor/music supervisor. He&#8217;s not the only one who has the final say…</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t take it personally. Rejection is par for the course in this line of work. It&#8217;s not personal, it&#8217;s not that you&#8217;re a bad person, it&#8217;s (hopefully) not that your music is dire. It just wasn&#8217;t right, and someone else got closer to that bullseye. Find out what the finished music was like, learn what it was that they meant by their brief, get over it and move on to the next job. <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>The third time I pitched, I have to be honest… my heart wasn&#8217;t really in it. It was not a passion project, but rather a friend&#8217;s film, co-produced with a big-name channel, destined for broadcast &#8211; and so had the promise of back-end royalties. My heart became less in it when I got 3 very different briefs over the course of 6 weeks with various revisions going back and forth. By the end, I was still putting in the effort, but the love for the work had gone. Ugh.</div>
<div>Can you guess whether I got the gig? You&#8217;d be right I suspect &#8211; no, I did not win this particular commission.</div>
<div>Did I mind? Surprisingly (or not), no, partly because by this point I had developed that elephant-thick skin that is so important when dealing with criticism and/or rejection. But partly I was also a little relieved. The brief was really tricky to pin down and changed with every new conversation I had… and I took that as a sign of things to come. Also the tracks I wrote were awesome and I&#8217;m now selling them as library tracks. Win-win. <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </div>
<div>Moral of the tale:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>When pitching, if the brief is hazy, ill-defined or keeps changing, you better develop some awesome mind-reading skills. Otherwise you have to rely on the gamble of guessing and hoping. This isn&#8217;t to say that you should avoid these gigs if they&#8217;re the only ones available to you at the time. You may get lucky. Just don&#8217;t get too attached to the outcome.</li>
<li>If a brief keeps changing as you pitch, it doesn&#8217;t bode well for the rest of the gig even if you do somehow win the commission.</li>
<li>If it&#8217;s not a passion project, or even a subject matter that interests you vaguely, the other benefits better be good. &#8216;Cos if they&#8217;re not… why are you pitching for it in the first place? There has to be some inspiration for those lines and dots, you know.</li>
<li>The music you wrote should be pretty awesome if you put your all into it. It still belongs to you. Why not flog it through a music library, or offer it to your local filmmaking buddies for non-exclusive licensing, if it&#8217;s appropriate for that sort of project. Sell it on iTunes. Don&#8217;t let it just sit there, put it to work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, as I write this I&#8217;m pitching again. I actually just finished uploading the tracks to the ftp!</p>
</div>
<div>Yikes.</div>
<div>This time the brief is pretty, well, brief. And not really a brief, more a transcription/reduction of an email conversation between the production company and the funding clients, where they decide that they&#8217;d like to compare different styles for the work rather than being very specific. It&#8217;s really very open-ended. But there are some &#8216;style&#8217; tracks that the clients appear to like and also a sample of the video to work to, which gives an idea of where they&#8217;re headed. And the genre of the project is sooooo in an area that I really want to get into, so the love is there.</div>
<div>So this one is a little bit of an experiment. I&#8217;m sticking to the &#8216;vibe&#8217; of the style tracks, but they&#8217;re definitely in my &#8216;niche&#8217; writing style too. I&#8217;m providing lots of variety within those styles, some very contemporary, some more orchestral and cinematic and also there&#8217;ll be tracks that blend the two styles.</div>
<div>If I get the gig, I want to be writing music that I want to write, that I love to write, that will make me jump out of bed in the morning in the knowledge that I&#8217;m scoring a series I&#8217;m excited about.</div>
<div>If I&#8217;m not the right gal for the gig with these tracks, I won&#8217;t be gutted that I didn&#8217;t get the job. I&#8217;ll be happy that I didn&#8217;t get contracted into writing for a project that wasn&#8217;t my cup of tea.</div>
<div>But I really do hope that I am the right gal for the job. <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </div>

Not unless you consider hard work, lots of rejection, or a healthy bent toward self-determination a &#8220;magic bullet&#8221;. Is there an easy way in? The answer, as with most things in life, is &#8220;no&#8221;. Most things that are worth doing don&#8217;t come easy. However, there are many tried and true methods as well as some proven principles that most of us here at SCO can safely say we&#8217;ve built our working careers on. While there would never been enough room to list them all, here are ten things that I&#8217;ve learned about getting a foothold and gaining some traction as a composer for film and television.<br />
<strong> <a name="more"></a></strong></p>
<p><strong> 1. Find a niche</strong> &#8211; style? medium? geography? &#8211; differentiate yourself. Embrace your unique qualities. What can you offer that no-one else can? Why on earth should they pick you for the gig?</p>
<div>Whilst it is a good idea to keep on top of the popular styles that are being asked for (the obvious ones that spring to mind are the Newman, Zimmer, Elfman schools of music) what is it that makes your style unique and special?</div>
<div>Got some crazy mad skills on the thumb piano or theremin? Build up your sound from that to give you an edge.</div>
<div>I&#8217;d have to say that one of my defining niches would be my geographical location. I&#8217;m not based in any of the conventional media centres (LA, NY, London) but despite the obvious inconveniences, it does have the added bonus of meaning competition for local composition work is minimal. And my overheads are way lower so more of my profits can go into the business and my quality of life, meaning my work gets better.</div>
<div>That&#8217;s not to say that had I been based in one of these aforementioned media cities I wouldn&#8217;t have made it into the business, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d be at a very different stage right now. Could have been better, or could have been much worse!<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Get over yourself</strong>. Think about it &#8211; put yourself in the mindset of a director. Who would you want to work with to create the music to your latest masterpiece film? The guy with an ego the size of Alaska, delusions of grandeur, who bangs on and on about themselves and how awesome their music is or how no-one can possibly understand the torment of their genius&#8230; or the chap that will really listen to what you have to say, feels the same passion as you for your project and has a sense of humour to boot?</p>
<div>
<div>Headshots with you in your shades looking deadly serious in moody black and white may not be the kind of image you want to project. Whilst I&#8217;ve no doubt you&#8217;re an awesome composer, there&#8217;ll always be someone better (but with the same reasoning, there are plenty of people who are worse, chin up!). Projecting an image of quietly confident professionalism and approachability will get you much further with media clientele.</div>
<div>Offer to demo for free. Go above and beyond the call of duty. If they just don&#8217;t like it though, this is a prime opportunity to develop a thick skin and remain objective… don&#8217;t take it personally when you don&#8217;t get the gig. Learn your lesson and move on to the next assault. There&#8217;s plenty more fish in the sea.</div>
<div>In fact, this happened to me only this last week &#8211; the executives for a feature I had pencilled in to score later in the year decided they wanted classical Indian music score rather than my line of tunage. The director was very apologetic. But even though it&#8217;s a bit of a bump in the road, I don&#8217;t mind. It&#8217;s happened before and I know it might happen again. The same way I know I&#8217;m still going to have the busiest year workwise on the most exciting projects I&#8217;ve done yet. How am I so sure? Because I&#8217;m going to make it happen (by following these tips <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />  ).<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Get Networking</strong> &#8211; <em>It&#8217;s not who you know, it&#8217;s what you know</em>. Going to a networking event? Prep your elevator pitch. You will most definitely be asked what you do, so get it summed up short and sweet. This is tricky and it really is worth rehearsing this in advance. You&#8217;ve got thirty seconds tops before the person opposite will get bored and zone out.</p>
<div>
<div>Then shut up and listen <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  Be approachable. Friendly. Smile! Ask questions, see if you can make connections, introduce and match-make, rather than constantly banging on about yourself, your music, your latest piece of gear (unless of course they ask! <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />  ). If you make a great contact, follow up after the event with an email or phone call. If you made no obvious contacts, don&#8217;t worry, sometimes these things are a slow burn and the chap you gave your business card to at the bar may know someone who needs your services down the line&#8230;</div>
<div>(Oh, and wear something red or brightly coloured. You&#8217;ll get remembered.)</div>
<div>Need to find networking opportunities? Google your town or city for production meetups/networking events, or if you&#8217;re in the UK your local film council office will probably run them or at least have relevant information for you.</div>
<div>Online networking opportunities are becoming more and more viable by the day. Get into Twitter to see if you like the format (hey, I got this awesome ScoreCast gig through Twitter!), and online forums may lead you to newbie director who may become the next big thing.</div>
<div><em><br />
</em></div>
<div><em>All of which should be leading you to…</em><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Cultivate relationships</span></p>
</div>
<div><em> &#8211; with decision makers</em> &#8211; directors, producers, execs<br />
<em> &#8211; with the troops</em> &#8211; editors, animators, post-production supervisors, assistants, runners<br />
<em> &#8211; with everyone and everyone</em>, you never know who in your family or circle of friends knows someone who knows someone…</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em>Every conversation is an opportunity <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </em><strong> </strong></p>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>5. Broaden your horizons</strong> &#8211; short films, indie projects, computer games, music libraries, wedding videos… Get creative with options, do some detective work on what&#8217;s in production locally or nationally. Google is your best friend to start this search. Get digging. Once you&#8217;ve found your dream job that&#8217;s currently in production&#8230;<strong> </strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>6. Be precise with your marketing</strong> &#8211; tailor your showreel and/or pitch package to the project you&#8217;re going after. The horror film director couldn&#8217;t care less about the romantic comedy short you just scored, no matter how lush the string samples. Get specific.<strong> </strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>7. Have an online portfolio or presence</strong>, either your own site or hosted on any of the many and varied dedicated sites for this, with music and clips, a list of credits &#8211; always drawing attention to the best ones! You haven&#8217;t got any credits? Put up your music samples then work for free on student films to get showreel fodder, and it&#8217;s good experience. Attach a blog to your site, have opinions, share your knowledge. You never know who&#8217;s reading.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">8. Don&#8217;t give up your day job just yet… </span>You gotta pay for the roof over your head, and (more importantly) your studio <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />  . Plus your music&#8217;ll really stink if you&#8217;re starving cos can&#8217;t afford to eat. You get my drift. You&#8217;ll know when you&#8217;re ready to take the plunge, when the income from composing overtakes the rest of your revenue streams. &#8216;Til that point, stay focussed on your dream but keep your feet planted squarely on the ground. Don&#8217;t be an idiot.<strong> </strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>9. Don&#8217;t give up your dreams, </strong>if they are what you truly desire. Where there&#8217;s a will, there&#8217;s a way, and the one thing that differentiates those that compose for a living from the others that will never make the grade is, simply, persistence.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">The singlemost important tip I could possibly give you is to keep the unwavering faith and vision of the goal that drives your passion &#8211; to make this crazy business of media music a way of life.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Be persistent, but not pushy. There&#8217;s a fine line and you only Eternal Optimism is the greatest weapon in your arsenal (that and the latest string sample set from EWQL, of course).<strong> </strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>10. I know I said there&#8217;d be ten tips</strong>&#8230; but here&#8217;s YOUR opportunity fellow SCOREcasters &#8211; share the love around!  Insert your own gems of advice from your own experience in the COMMENTS below!</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sig-fenoughty.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-583" title="sig-fenoughty" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sig-fenoughty.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>I am not the most tech-minded of people.</p>
<p>I thought Logic 9 was 64-bit until it was pointed out to me on Twitter that it wasn&#8217;t. I didn&#8217;t care though. It still runs lovely and fast. And on Snow Leopard too, which is a shock because I thought I was being a little risky upgrading when I did… but so far so good. In fact better than good, to be fair.</p>
<p>Just so long as the equipment serves the higher function to create music as easily, quickly, efficiently and intuitively as possible, then I&#8217;m a happy bunny.</p>
<p>Let me explain&#8230; right after the jump&#8230;<br />
<a name="more"></a>I just wish I had an interface like Tom Cruise had in &#8220;Minority Report&#8221;. Imagine how much fun that would be. And you&#8217;d get a workout at the same time, none of this sore-arse-fat-belly-tired-eyes that sitting staring at an itty-bitty monitor does to one who chooses to follow our particular line of work.</p>
<div><em>Just an aside &#8211; that UI technology now exists, courtesy of </em><em><a href="http://oblong.com/">Oblong Industries Inc.</a> </em><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/dyMVZqJk8s4&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/dyMVZqJk8s4&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;fs=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<div>If there&#8217;s one tip I can give aspiring composers that may actually cause a ruckus (because it has done before when I&#8217;ve aired opinions on this matter) is that whatever technology you have at your disposal, however low or high-end the set-up that&#8217;s in front of you…<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Work to the strengths of your gear</span><br />
Never mind you want an oboe solo but your sample sounds shite and you can&#8217;t get a live player round to record it before your deadline at 10 am tomorrow. Don&#8217;t have a oboe solo. Simple as that.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what strengths and weaknesses your assembly has &#8211; that&#8217;s for you to work out through exploration and experimentation &#8211; the fun part!<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Make time to experiment</span><br />
…and remember to love the process. Being creative musically isn&#8217;t about being right and correct and perfect first time. It&#8217;s about hearing things from a new angle, smashing two genres together, blending sounds to create new and interesting breeds, digging deep into the available parameters to see if tweaking this particular fader will give birth to something wonderful. Or hideous. It doesn&#8217;t matter. That&#8217;s the process. And you never know when that bizzarro-world custom preset will be the perfect element for  a score.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Make a wishlist</span><br />
&#8230; of bits of gear or effects or samples that you want. Be specific. Man, I&#8217;m so psyched for flutter-tongued flutes at the moment. Ever since I heard it in Giacchino&#8217;s score for Star Trek (track 5 on OST, och, fires me up — ready for anything every time!).</p>
<p>So if your oboe sample is yukky and quacky, and you didn&#8217;t rethink that admittedly questionable decision to insert an oboe solo, find a sample library with a decent one. Or try out <a href="../../../2009/07/sample-libraries-meet-wivi.html">WIVI</a>s as recommended by Jim Well. Research your options, ask advice, get opinions, listen listen listen.</p>
<p>Maybe the best thing to do is to sample one of those goddamn oboes yourself. Or just scrap it. They do sound pretty quacky at the best of times you know. And there&#8217;s no way you can hear the dialogue over the top so you know the sound mixer&#8217;s just gonna turn the volume on your track waaaay down…<em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Get minimalist</strong></em><br />
This might be a contentious one. I blogged about this recently, my new quest to get minimalist with my working as a way of sparking creativity. In response, someone commented on email that when composer guys get new toys (read: technological equipment) it ups their testosterone &#8216;cos they get all excited about it and that fires their creativity.</p>
<p>Man, is this for real? Men are weird.</p>
<p>Aw, just kidding, love you all really <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>But back to the point: strip away the bits and bobs of gear, software and hardware that you never use because they&#8217;ve been usurped in your setup by newer, better stuff. Do you really need 15 different reverb modules? Do you really use them all?</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love a new module or software gadget as much as the next guy, but only as a means to creating better and more appropriate music &#8211; for the potential for creating something that you couldn&#8217;t have made without it.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s gathering dust in the corner of your workstation? Box it up, put it in storage, sell it, give it away.  Your new minimalist workspace and system will free the inner creative with the space of a streamlined playground.</p>
<p>In summary…<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Music Technology is your servant.</span><br />
A means to an end. It is there solely as a tool to create music. You may enjoy using it, but the end goal is the music itself. Don&#8217;t be a slave to it, to the latest bit of gear, just to keep up with the Jones&#8217;. Or the Zimmers.</p>
<p>Get what you need, work it to its strengths, find updates and alternatives for its weaknesses, remove what you no longer need or no longer serves you.</p>
<p>Good advice for life really.</p>

<div>
<p>And no matter how much you stare at that blank sequencer page, the notes just aren&#8217;t forthcoming? And you wonder if you&#8217;ll ever get that li&#8217;l spark of inspiration back..</p>
<p>How do you get your compositional, creative, musical mojo back if it&#8217;s gone on hiatus and you&#8217;re suffering a little <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8216;Creative Burnout&#8217;?</span></p>
<p>First: recognise that though you are sadly mojo-less now but that it shall inevitably return again! We&#8217;ve all experienced it from time to time, it&#8217;s perfectly normal, and there really is light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>Make time to recharge the juices in your creative batteries and then get back in the game. <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>So… I was brainstorming ideas for this here topic of creativity and creative processes (of course, Creativity 101 is brainstorming, how else would I start)… and my research led me to this post:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/essays/33-how-to-survive-creative-burnout/" target="_blank">How to survive creative burnout by Scott Berkun</a></p>
<p>I cannot tell you how this post resonated with me, an utterly positive experience &#8211; a relief.</p>
<h3>Wake Up Call</h3>
<p>I read recently in one of Deane&#8217;s comments</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Unless your heart is miserable when you are not making music, unless you feel sick to your stomach when you are not composing the music you hear in your everyday life meanderings, please, I beg you&#8230; go do something else.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-style: italic; text-align: right;">Comment in <a href="../../../2009/11/weekend-provocation-gets-uncomfortable.html">Weekend Provocation Gets Uncomfortable</a></span></p>
<p>I cannot tell you how that depressed me.</p>
<p>Because, at that time, I could think of nothing less I&#8217;d rather do than sit at the computer and write music.</p>
<p>Yes. Alarm bells, people. This was not a nice place to be in. Should I go do something else? If the thought of composing was turning me into a grumpy wretch, perhaps now was the time to reevaluate certain life choices.</p>
<p>I have been composing for as long as I can remember. Even before all the formal training stuff, I&#8217;ve been writing little ditties and improvising on various instruments. It&#8217;s just something that I like to do. There&#8217;s always a tune evolving in my head. There&#8217;s no off switch for that particular radio (bit pschizo I know, but maybe that&#8217;s what it takes to be creative, eh?).</p>
<p>Though I don&#8217;t get the pangs that Deane clearly feels if I&#8217;m not composing, I get really ratty if I&#8217;m not allowed to write, for whatever reason, for several days in a row. Totally antsy, mean and not very nice to be around. I&#8217;m never happier or more energised than when I&#8217;m in the flow and composing in the studio.</p>
<p>It was a gradual feeling that slithered up without me even realising it, but recently I wasn&#8217;t getting that kick out of the process. And that&#8217;s why we do it isn&#8217;t it? Put ourselves through the heartwrenching lows and orgasmic highs to scribe our feelings into music? Because we love it, masochistic types that we are <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>So there was no kick. No nothing.</p>
<p>But now I&#8217;m back in the game. Wooh yeah! It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m 22 again and the music&#8217;s just flowing.</p>
<p>So what was this weird blip I experienced? Creative burnout. Sounds a bit yuppy psychobabble but it fits the bill&#8230;</p>
<h3>Toasty</h3>
<p>Reading through Scott Berkun&#8217;s post, I realised that what I was experienced was completely normal, other people go through it, and, more importantly, it&#8217;s not permanent. I wish I&#8217;d found the post a month or so ago, and perhaps the recovery process would have been more expedient, and certainly less worrisome.</p>
<p>But as it is, I found a way through it, and if this post helps just one of you lovely SCORECast readers avoid the burnout, or (if it&#8217;s inevitable in your line of work, as I suspect it may be in mine) recover from it faster, perhaps it will have a had a greater purpose.</p>
<p>Cos it really did suck big time.</p>
<p>From Scott&#8217;s article, here are some of the common signs of burnout:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You dread getting up in the morning (unless this is not unusual for you)</li>
<li>You don’t care anymore about something you were passionate about</li>
<li>You saw the title of this essay and felt a ray of hope</li>
<li>Inspired motivated creative people annoy you</li>
<li>Everything seems gray and pointless</li>
<li>You’re drinking more or eating more, or showing whatever your signs of depression are</li>
<li>You find it hard to relax</li>
<li>It seems impossible to do basic work you know you’re capable of</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Any of this sound familiar? :-S</p>
<p>I had gotten to the end of a long series of very cool, but exacting, scheduled projects and had returned home with the idea that now I could work on my own ideas, write something just for me &#8211; that perhaps that was the problem, and I just needed to spend a little time composing purely for the sake of it.</p>
<p>My muse clearly had other plans though. She&#8217;d up and left and headed out the country, it seems. Sick of the never-ending requests for inspiration, she was wrung dry, and not best pleased about it.</p>
<p>So I decided not to fight it.</p>
<p>This has to be Step 1 in the recovery strategy for Creative Burnout &#8211; <em>Acceptance</em>.</p>
<p>Realise that the only way around is through it. Be ok with it. And go and do something else.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s Step 2 &#8211; <em>do something else</em>. Don&#8217;t just wallow in self-loathing and disgust cos the tunes aren&#8217;t materialising. Do something fun, different, exciting, relaxing. Despite my independent feminist right-on perspectives, I ended up baking cookies, brownies, cakes etc. Yummy, sweet, warming things that maybe weren&#8217;t so great for the waistline in the long term, but in the short term it was something fun, very different (food prep is my better-half&#8217;s arena), easy but a little creative, with something physical and real to show for it at the end.</p>
<p>Maybe that was Step 3 &#8211; <em>do something creative but in a different field</em>.</p>
<p>Then there was all the other practical stuff that would have probably sorted me out eventually had I not done any of the above &#8211; I got enough sleep, ate really well (apart from all the cookies), got back into yoga and  met up with friends that I didn&#8217;t have the chance to previously because of long hours at work and generally being v tired, not exactly life and soul of the party.</p>
<p>So now it&#8217;s all good. I&#8217;m back on track, and utterly relieved.</p>
<p>Maybe it is an inevitable part of the Film Composer&#8217;s life that Creative Burnout looms purely from a result of plumbing the depths of our emotions and processing them with the full extent of our skills, on demand, on a regular basis and to tight schedules.</p>
<p>Having gone through it I know that if ever happens again, rather than mistaking it for a sign that I should quit the business, I will now recognise it for the temporary, fixable event that it is.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just a little reminder to take a step back and recharge the batteries ready for the next epic score. <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p><em>Over to you&#8230;</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Have you ever experienced any of the symptoms of creative burnout?<br />
What strategies got you through to the other side?<br />
What do you do differently in future to avoid it?</strong></p>
<p>All anecdotes and advice strongly appreciated!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also interested to see how many of us will admit to it. We&#8217;re supposed to be constantly up, ready to give the project our all, to keep writing into the fourteenth hour and have those creative juices ready and raring to go the next day without fail &#8211; is it professional suicide to admit defeat? To realise that you gotta recharge those inspiration batteries once in a while?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so… at least… I hope not… <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

</span></p>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">• Communication flows freer and easier.</span></span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">• Trust is already developed.</span></span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">• Familiarity enables shortcuts in explaining ideas.</span></span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">• Practicalities such as file transfer and online collaboration tools have already been explored. </span></span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Each party just knows from experience how the system works.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">So when a new client comes along it can be a little jolt to that comfortable system. Starting from scratch in a new business relationship can be daunting.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">So, why bother working with new clients when it&#8217;s so much easier just to stick with what you know?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Well, for one thing, we should all be so lucky! Sometimes there are quiet patches, sometimes previous clients just don&#8217;t have the work for us. And that&#8217;s the time when you&#8217;re grateful that your word-of-mouth marketing from these previous clients is just so damn good that the phone is ringing off of the hook with new offers. <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">What I most like about working with new clients is that it can be a real wake-up call to get you out of your comfort zone, get your brain working in different modes in response to a new director&#8217;s style, way of thinking and communicating.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Follow a few simple rules to make this new relationship start smoothly, and it should continue long into both your futures.<strong> </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Talk, talk, then talk some more.</strong> For the initial meeting, and maybe the one after that, I like to free up my schedule afterwards just in case it runs long. In fact, I hope it runs long, so that we can get into the interesting discussions that make it easier to build the foundations for future collaborations.<strong> </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Ask questions.</strong> What is this new director all about? What films, television, theatre, books, stories, themes do they like? What don&#8217;t they like? Who do they admire in the business? What are their goals for the film? And for their next project?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">And their ideal, future career plans? Seriously, clients love to talk about this, and by involving yourself in this emotive topic, empathizing with their excitement or trepidation, providing potential solutions to any issues they flag up, you may indeed entwine yourself into that future vision!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Time spent talking about these subjects isn&#8217;t a luxury, it&#8217;s a necessity. <em>It&#8217;s essential.</em> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">You need to know who your director is, what presses their buttons, flicks their switches, gets them fired up and really ticks them off. Then you&#8217;ll have a much better chance of writing the music they need.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Other things to discuss:<strong> </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>1. Be clear on each party&#8217;s role.</strong> You&#8217;re the composer (or sound designer, foley artist etc); he&#8217;s the director (or post-production supervisor or producer etc). You may collaborate and discuss ideas with anyone else on the team, but ultimately you take the final decisions from him or her alone. No exceptions.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Don&#8217;t ever accept decision by committee. Can&#8217;t stress this enough, people! It inevitably ends up with brain-ache and hair loss.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Conversely, if your role is composer, you write the music. That&#8217;s what you&#8217;re hired for. It&#8217;s not the director&#8217;s job to say, <em>&#8220;and here I&#8217;d like to go into Eminor with a natural 7th, a BPM of 160 with the melody on the nose-flute. And more cowbell.&#8221;</em> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">If that&#8217;s what he really wants, he sounds like he&#8217;s already got the smarts to do it himself. He&#8217;s after an arranger/orchestra/ghostwriter, not a composer. If that&#8217;s not what you signed up for, now&#8217;s the time to make that known.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Although, I think it&#8217;s a given that one can always use more cowbell.<strong> </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>2. Ensure a clear goal that both parties agree on.</strong> Make sure it&#8217;s realistic. Agree preliminary, intermediate and final draft delivery dates. Agree also how many revisions is practical and realistic within time frame and budget.<strong> </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>3. Be easy to work with.</strong> Be nice! Smile, listen, empathise, respond, understand. Being professional, hitting deadlines is expected; but being easy to work with means that you&#8217;re one less ego for the director to deal with. He&#8217;s dealt with many before he&#8217;s got to your part of the process. Go against the grain and be a breath of fresh air for him or her.<strong> </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>4. Go above and beyond the call of duty.</strong> Provide as much value as you can. Be better than the next guy. <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> <strong> </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>5. Emphasize your objectivity</strong> towards your craft and product. That you understand that your music or sound is raw material for the ultimate final vision of the film. As such you will be open to constructive criticism, changes of direction, etc.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">I cannot stress this enough. The director must be made to understand that the first draft is just that, and it certainly isn&#8217;t written in stone, and if they don&#8217;t like it<em> you can and will change it.</em> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">This first draft is a more concrete point of reference, a point of reflection which both parties can talk about in &#8216;real&#8217; terms, and is necessary for the next draft to be the best it can be, even if it&#8217;s in a completely different style.<strong> </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>6. Talk about </strong><strong>how best you work</strong>, your strategies to get the best from your time when composing etc. Hopefully this will illustrate that if you&#8217;re the kind of chap who doesn&#8217;t enjoy writing music with someone watching over your shoulder, they won&#8217;t insist on doing just that.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">If you&#8217;re a scheduling, organizational freak like me, and say so, they won&#8217;t start a habit of &#8216;popping by&#8217; unannounced. However, if you&#8217;re keeping the lines of communication open, they really shouldn&#8217;t ever feel the need.<strong> </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>7. B</strong><strong>e as available as you possibly can be to lines of communication </strong>- phone, email, in-person meetings&#8230; </span><span style="font-size: small;">within reason. Talking on the phone ain&#8217;t gonna get that score written, which is ultimately what you&#8217;ve been hired for. However, </span><span style="font-size: small;">communication is key to collaboration. Make sure they feel absolutely free to contact you about any ideas or thoughts or questions that will impact on the direction of the music and sound, and b</span><span style="font-size: small;">e communicative in return. Reply to emails and voicemail regularly.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8212;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">I find that when I follow this pattern from the very start of the relationship, and if the client is successful enough, I&#8217;m pretty much guaranteed repeat business should I choose to take up the opportunity.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Think of it from the director&#8217;s point of view: he&#8217;s built this fantastic rapport and trust with you through all this communication, and clearly you&#8217;re easy to collaborate with, take direction easily, are very responsive (and obviously produce great results!). Why would they want to go to all the hassle of starting from scratch again with a new composer, eh?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Whilst scribbling down these ideas I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve missed a whole bunch of other points that make the process of working with a new client easier. If you&#8217;ve noticed any glaring holes, do let us know in the COMMENTS below!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">What experiences have you had with new clients that we can learn from?</span></span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sig-fenoughty1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-632" title="sig-fenoughty" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sig-fenoughty1.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>In a recent <a href="../../../2009/07/how-to-work-on-multiple-projects-and.html">Scorecast article</a> I wrote that I&#8217;ve never turned composing work down that I honestly believe I have the time and the skills to work on.</div>
<div>That was about 2 months ago, right in the middle of practicing what I preached and jumping in the deep end with my organizational (=juggling) skills.</div>
<div>I was already working on several shows back-to-back with <a href="http://www.slunglow.org/">Slung Low</a>, the awesome experimental theatre company that consistently attempts to push the boundaries of theatre whilst still remaining faithful to the notion of a story, a narrative structure. Fun stuff, and pretty well paid, working with lovely people, playing at very prestigious theatre houses. Ticked all the boxes.</div>
<div>I was also booked in solidly every single weekend and most Fridays to play in a string trio for weddings. Summer&#8217;s the busiest time for gigs and these were mostly booked in a year in advance. They are quite hard work and tiring, some of them quite far away and involving a lot of time spent travelling, but it&#8217;s very well paid and the people are, again, really lovely to work with. So this ticks some of the boxes.</div>
<div>I was teaching violin two nights a week too. Not very much mind, only totalling about 4 or 5 hours. This is something I&#8217;ve done for around 7 years now so it was easy work, for ok-ish pay and most of the students worked reasonably hard. One or two boxes ticked, but not high on my list of vocational priorities. The students didn&#8217;t seem to mind when I cancelled lessons for 2 to 3 weeks at a time to fit around composing, so I reasoned with myself that it was win-win.</div>
<div>But then&#8230; da da daaaah! A feature film comes along. A horror, low-but-doable-budget, produced and shot locally. A drama as well. I hadn&#8217;t done one of those before in feature-length form, a massive box to tick! The pay was very good, the story was fun, the director was a sound chap and we were definitely on the same wavelength when it came to the films and music we liked.  Box ticking all round!</div>
<div>So I took on all this work, and I was hideously well-organised. I even delegated a few small elements of sound design and recording to specialists and other people wanting to get credits and a foot-on-the-ladder of working in film.</div>
<div>But I forgot to factor in any time off. At all. From July through to the beginning of August I worked solidly every day from 9 in the morning til at least 7 at night. Some mornings I started at 7am to fit in all of the composition alongside the playing, teaching and admin tasks.</div>
<div>Truth be told, I&#8217;ve never really had to factor it in time off before this year, it just sort of works itself out. There&#8217;ll a few days here and there between small projects where I can catch up on household chores, shop, kick back and read, go for walks, visit friends. So why would I need to schedule it in now?</div>
<div>I&#8217;m also a bit of a productivity freak. I like to think that my mind and body is essentially a machine: if I eat and drink right, all activities in moderation, keep my vulcan-logical-focussed head on, I can accomplish pretty much any task I&#8217;ve set myself. I don&#8217;t have kids so don&#8217;t need to worry about their needs, just me and my boyfriend (who&#8217;s a writer who keeps the same sort of freelance schedule as me, and is fantastically supportive and helpful when I&#8217;m busy busy busy).</div>
<div>But I think I may have pushed it too far. The first sign was where I actually got pretty sick of writing music and started to have fantasies about a 9 til 5, 5 days a week office job. You know. Weekends off, and all that sort of ridiculousness. <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </div>
<div>Actually that was a pretty glaring sign that something was up.</div>
<div>I still got the work done. I enjoyed it to a degree when I reminded myself how cool my job was. But it was a conscious effort &#8211; not a natural feeling that made me want to jump out of bed as soon as I woke up &#8211; to keep that in mind.</div>
<div>The work that I created was actually some of the coolest stuff I&#8217;ve written, but I only see that now looking back on it. At the time I, at moments, became so disenchanted that I couldn&#8217;t hear whether or not it was right for the cue, never mind good music.</div>
<div>My first day off after this session of busy busy busy was utter bliss. I took the opportunity to think about how my summer was spent. I&#8217;d written more music in a short amount of time than I ever had before. I&#8217;d several impressive credits to add to the resume. My bank balance looked happier and happier.</div>
<div>But I was absolutely shattered. Bushwacked. Dead-on-my-feet. And I&#8217;d developed some hideous RSI in my right hand from click click clicking that mouse all day long.</div>
<div>Something not quite right here.</div>
<div>A long hard look at my work commitments compared with my life priorities saw a few glaring clashes. Everything I do must lead to me writing music for a living. It&#8217;s the only job I&#8217;m ever completely happy and confident in. It&#8217;s the only career I can ever imagine doing in the long haul.</div>
<div>Which led in turn to a few tricky decisions. The first one was to quit teaching.</div>
<div>Though this wasn&#8217;t, surprisingly, as difficult as I first imagined it would be. Every student was happy for me, and also pleased that I&#8217;d found them alternative tuition that would be more consistent than they&#8217;d been getting all year from me. The teachers that I passed them onto all love teaching and it&#8217;s very much a vocation for them. All very amicable &#8211; score!</div>
<div>As has been said on here many times, film music scoring is a collaborative business, and if you&#8217;re going to make it, you&#8217;ll be doing it with the help of many people behind the scenes. I&#8217;m slowly but surely assembling a team of skilled freelance sound recordists, editors and designers &#8211; that really enjoy their work, and that the credits are useful to &#8211; that I can trust to take on those tasks when I&#8217;ve gotta get my head down on the score.</div>
<div>I&#8217;m also looking into making relationships with orchestrators, bigger recording facilities and contractors along with specialist instrumentalists, so that when it gets hectic again that team is ready in place and ready to go!</div>
<div>There are a couple of other decisions that I&#8217;ll have to deal with eventually, but I&#8217;m going to take them very gradually&#8230; for the sake of my own nerves if anything. <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </div>
<div>I&#8217;m also attempting an experiment: to schedule 1 day off a week for recovery, fun and &#8216;sharpening the saw&#8217;. Even that&#8217;s tricky at the moment, and I&#8217;m just about managing 1 day every 2 or 3 weeks at this rate. But it&#8217;s still a step in the right direction and it&#8217;s really making a difference.</div>
<div>It&#8217;s not easy also because this default work habit is so utterly ingrained in every fibre of my being. I&#8217;m still scoring two more awesome shows with Slung Low and playing with the trio. I think there are some other people that I work with on a regular basis who are quite surprised by this paradigm shift in my priorities, and I&#8217;m sensing that it may pee off a few of my colleagues. I can understand their point of view!</div>
<div>But as the one living in my skin I will apologise and, like I attempted with my violin students, hope to make the transition to a new worklife balance as easy and smooth as possible for everyone involved&#8230;</div>
<div>And hopefully, this way, when another one of these fantastic opportunities comes a-knocking, I&#8217;ll have a system and a schedule in place that is free and flexible enough to fit it in comfortably and realistically, not bulging out at the seams.</div>
<div>Or am I being naively unrealistic?</div>
<div>Is what I am trying to achieve beyond the grasp of the jobbing composer simply by the nature of the beast?</div>
<div>Crikey. Hope not. <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/08/sig-fenoughty.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-646" title="sig-fenoughty" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/08/sig-fenoughty.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>As much as I love and live for television drama, I&#8217;ve yet to actually compose for a single episode, and though deep down that&#8217;s really what I&#8217;d love to do, part of me wonders if extreme physical and mental investment required just to do the job, never mind to the job well, is really that enjoyable&#8230; so in the meantime (whilst I psyche myself up for it a bit more) here are a few ways I&#8217;ve gotten my tunes on the TV without going mental from overwork <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> &#8230;</p>
<p>Up until now, I&#8217;ve written primarily for the UK market. I&#8217;ve scored one-off hour-long documentary &#8216;specials&#8217;, licensed pre-written music for documentaries, and composed scores for television documentary movies.</p>
<p>Not a lot of drama in there. Ah well, the docs were still pretty dramatic in places!</p>
<p>Rather than discuss the process of composing music for documentary (which, for all intents and purposes, is actually pretty similar to composing for drama), I thought it might be more useful to talk about the ways my naive younger self navigated the turbulent waters of the royalty system.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Royalties &#8211; The Holy Grail</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Royalties are the reason that we, as composers, rather like writing for television broadcast products. So long as you don&#8217;t sign all those lovely copyrights away (and, seriously now, you really shouldn&#8217;t. Ever.), every broadcasted minute of your music should return actual hard cash into your pocket. Just for being aired. You didn&#8217;t have to do anything to get it (except write it in the first place, of course). It&#8217;s your right. How very lovely, eh? Which is a relief because the upfront fee one gets paid for these broadcast products is usually a bit rubbish.</span></span></p>
</div>
<div>To be honest, one of the hour-long special I wrote a few tracks for paid well, basically as I was writing the titles and credits music along with a couple of underscores. It&#8217;s also probably something to with the fact that I was also working with this small company already as a production assistant/sound recordist/coffee-maid and so I was working with friends, who wouldn&#8217;t see me screwed over money-wise.</p>
<p>However, I was young and naive and didn&#8217;t know I had to register with PRS (Performing Rights Society, a royalty collection agency) to get royalties. Duh.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Royalty Collection Societies</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I didn&#8217;t even know I was entitled to royalties. It&#8217;s something they really should drill into you at Film School, but for me it was just a footnote that passed me buy. You live and learn&#8230;</span></span></p>
</div>
<div>Three years later I sat with a publisher who talked me through my options &#8211; he found my details on the PRS database, and whilst it didn&#8217;t say exactly what I was owed, it was a sizeable chunk and I left the meeting elated&#8230; only to talk on the phone with PRS for them to tell me I wasn&#8217;t entitled to it.</div>
<div>I wasn&#8217;t a registered member, and even if I became one I wouldn&#8217;t be able to claim for anything broadcast more than  6 months ago. Gutted does not even begin to describe how I felt. In fact I felt downright stupid.</p>
<p>Turns out there was a silver lining&#8230; the publisher I spoke to originally agreed to represent me in order that I might claim the money back through him, for a small commission, of course, but that&#8217;s the price you pay for being rather naive.</p>
<p><strong>Music&#8230; For Free????</strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">I was approached another time by a colleague who was working on a low budget documentary and couldn&#8217;t offer to pay any money for music, but wondered if I could license a few tracks in my catalogue that would fit the bill.</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>Now&#8230; this is a tricky situation. Provide music for no remuneration? No way! I hear you exclaim&#8230; but let me explain further.</p>
<p>The documentary was guaranteed to be broadcast at least twice on one of the (then) big four terrestrial channels we have in the UK (BBC1, BBC2, ITV, Channel4). And it was primetime. At this time that meant millions of viewers (sadly becoming unheard of now with the recent explosion of channels).</p>
<p>I knew from the aformentioned previous experience that this would, again, be a decent wadge of cash at some point in the not too distant future for an otherwise out-of-work composer. It was also a very good credit on my (then) pitiful resume.</p>
<p>So I said yes. I&#8217;m actually rather glad I did &#8211; whilst it&#8217;s a little morally reprehensible for them to not even offer a token amount as acknowledgement of the transaction, the royalties from that little documentary keep coming in. It&#8217;s been repeated again and again, they wheel it out without fail every year at a certain seasonal time. I loves me a little passive income, I does.</p>
<p>A producer once said to me, a little apologetically, to be fair &#8211; &#8216;there&#8217;s no line in the budget for music&#8217;. No line? Not even the mention of music? I still negotiated a smidgeon of an upfront fee, and at the time the money was very welcome, and again gained a rather nice credit.</p>
<p>This time it was for a feature-length documentary, destined primarily for British television, but the company had a track record of selling their documentary films abroad to Europe, the US and Japan. Great! I thought. Worldwide royalty returns!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cultural Differences</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">But, again, I needed a little education on how differently the television royalty systems of the world function. Apparently (and you guys over there in the States can let me know if I&#8217;m right or not on the former) in the US and Japan royalties aren&#8217;t worth collecting for a one-off showings on local networks. Cue sheets probably won&#8217;t even get filed. Ugh. So no dosh there.</span></span></p>
</div>
<div>The UK royalties were, again, rather nice, but nothing to write home about, and certainly didn&#8217;t cover what I coulda shoulda charged upfront. I was a little disgruntled. Sure, I&#8217;d gotten a nice credit, but that doesn&#8217;t pay for the roof over your head and the food on your plate. That was until&#8230; the European royalties came through. My goodness me. That paid for it and then some. Lovely lovely lovely.</p>
<p>So the lesson is&#8230; sell to Europe! They&#8217;re rather generous <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Oh, and also, get registered with your Royalty Collection Society as soon as you&#8217;ve had anything broadcast on the tellybox. Tout de suite.</p>

There&#8217;s nothing for a while, then three projects come along at once.</p>
<p>In the last six months I have been inundated with composing and sound design work for film and theatre and I am constantly thanking my lucky stars. This is exactly what I wanted when I started out many years ago.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<div style="float: right; margin: auto 0px 30px 30px;"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5360077328352690530" style="float: right; margin: 0pt 10px 30px 0pt;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R_A7kO7XEmo/SmLR7mUWQWI/AAAAAAAAACA/02xwteqKs4Y/s320/graphicscore.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">Stay sane in the midst of chaos!</div>
</div>
<p>Just kidding &#8211; of course it is, but on a day-to-day basis it can be a little bit of a challenge to keep the many, many minutes of music flowing, pouring out your heart and soul on demand, whilst maintaining a vague level of sanity.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really, truly and utterly important not to take on too much work. The amount that will make all of your creative efforts suffer and, inevitably, life miserable (plus you&#8217;ll likely get a rep and your success&#8217;ll be pretty short-lived).</p>
<p>But short of that, I&#8217;ve never turned composing work down that I honestly believe I have the time and the skills to work on. This strategy hasn&#8217;t failed me yet <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<h2>Variety</h2>
<p>The variety of having multiple composing projects on the go is fantastic, and I really do enjoy it. In a way, having several very different works in progress keeps the interest going and staves off staleness. If you do hit a brick wall and are seriously not in the right mindset for one project there&#8217;s always the option of switching around your schedule to work on another.</p>
<h2>Figure out how best you work&#8230;</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re built this way, you can always &#8216;flit&#8217; between tasks, as suggested as a way of working in <a href="../../../2009/01/lee-sanders.html" target="_blank">Lee Sanders&#8217;</a> post <a href="../../../2009/04/so-im-trying-out-this-blog-for-very.html" target="_blank">&#8216;To Flit or Not to Flit&#8217;</a>.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;m a lot more like <a href="../../../2009/05/joe-trapanese.html" target="_blank"> Joe Trapenese</a> in his comment below the aforementioned post &#8211; <span style="font-style: italic;">compartmentalized.</span> I&#8217;m a firm believer that, once the task for the day has been chosen, then being completely immersed in that project and that project alone gets the best music out there.</p>
<p>Getting the music out there on time, to schedule, up to standard, requires focus. 100% concentration on the project at hand. I&#8217;ve found that, without that focus, the work suffers. Turn twitter and email off. If you really need to churn out the notes, turn off your mobile phone (sorry, US readers, cellphone!). Ignore the landline phone, turn off the ringer if you can. Stick a note on your door, &#8216;no interruptions on pain of death!&#8217; And so on, and so on.</p>
<h2>Organize Your Time</h2>
<p>Be ruthlessly organized. Take a little time to plot your schedule realistically. Because I know I work compartmentally, I group specific projects into days, or better still into weeks.</p>
<p>What time of day are you most productive? Are you an <a href="http://www.heather-fenoughty.com/blog/2009/03/20/early-bird-or-night-owl" target="_blank">early bird or a night owl</a>? Schedule your creative and admin tasks accordingly.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prioritize</span><br />
What tasks have you to do that are important (seriously, though, what&#8217;s more important than writing music? ok, ok, family, exercise, blah blah blah <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />  )? What&#8217;s urgent? What&#8217;s neither (then why is it on the list? Come on, you gotta write five minutes of music today!)?</p>
<p><a href="http://onstartups.com/home/tabid/3339/bid/8853/Startup-Conversations-With-Myself-What-Should-I-Work-On.aspx" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s a useful post by a chap who&#8217;s struggling with prioritising his tasks</a>. Though it&#8217;s geared towards more general Startup Entrepeneur types, there&#8217;s a lot of relevant points for us busy composers.</p>
<p>You can be seriously anal with this sort of organization if that floats your boat. Back in uni, one of my lecturers recommended that you decide specifically which cues you&#8217;ll compose on which day during your schedule right after the spotting session. You work on that cue on that day until it&#8217;s finished, no matter how long it takes. Conversely, as a reward for finishing a cue earlier than expected, instead of carrying on with the next scheduled cue early, stop work for the day.</p>
<p>Personally, I like to set myself a specific duration of music which has to be written by the end of the working day rather than specific cues. Which allows me the freedom to do a sort of flitting, I suppose, between similar cues, without being completely restricted.</p>
<h2>Task switching</h2>
<p>One thing I&#8217;ve discovered is that it&#8217;s really tricky to switch between composing projects quickly during the same day. Mike Carey, fabulous novel and comic author of various titles for Hellblazer amongst others says that, ideally, sticking to one project-per-day is the ideal formula, and from experience this year I would have to agree. <a href="http://mikeandpeter.com/2009/07/a-whole-lot-of-marvel-stuff%E2%80%A6/comment-page-1/#comment-189" target="_blank">Read his comment here.</a></p>
<p>While it takes maybe 15 minutes or so to get into that &#8216;flow&#8217; state of pure concentration when starting the first composing task of the day, it can take anywhere up to an hour or more to get my head into gear if I have to switch between projects during that same day; the tunes in my head are still from the first project. And that&#8217;s a couple of hours we can ill-afford to waste if there&#8217;s a way around it, by careful planning and blocking of time to ensure the project-per-day rule.</p>
<h2>&#8216;Gateway&#8217; Activity</h2>
<p>But if you&#8217;re really stuffed for time, Mike Carey suggests creating an intentional &#8216;gateway&#8217; activity to switch between projects: re-reading (or listening) to previous completed project-specific work, listening to a piece of music that puts you in the right moodstate, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Heck &#8211; go for a walk or take a nap and really delineate the time between the two projects definitively. This is great, practical, common-sense stuff that really does work.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve recently found leaving a cue deliberately half-finished for the next time I start to work on that project is rather a sneaky way of getting the brain into gear without having to start from that initially difficult &#8216;blank-page&#8217; scenario. I&#8217;ll write a note in a marker on the timeline to myself &#8211; &#8216;fix timing here&#8217;, &#8216;check instrumentation&#8217;, etc. Because that cue appeared to take less time to write than it would have if it had been started from scratch in one sitting, it&#8217;ll have a positive feedback affect and seems to create momentum to push me into the next cue a little bit more easily than had I not gone through this process.</p>
<h2>Get a Head Start</h2>
<p>As much as possible, be involved in the project as early as possible.</p>
<p>This is easier said than done as often, as composers, we have no say in how late in the day we&#8217;re approached to work on a film or other media project. I&#8217;m a firm believer that the subconscious is a much more useful creativity tool than it&#8217;s given credit for, and that the longer I can give it the task to come up with themes and sounds and palettes and tones for a given project the better, without necessarily actually writing a note until final cut.</p>
<p>Which segues nicely onto a sticky subject&#8230; composing to picture before it is locked off.</p>
<p>Love it or hate it, this is generally the reality now: a necessity in these days of dwindling time-scales for post-production sound. All I can say is that, whilst this is a less than ideal scenario, it&#8217;s something to accept, to get used to and try to work to your advantage.</p>
<p>Keep the cues as fluid as possible, simplify your orchestration so that you can keep all the cues in one arrangement file for as long as possible before the computer starts to grind to a halt, and you have to save cues to separate files, and keep in touch with the editor and director to see which edits are likely to remain into the locked cut.</p>
<h2>Delegate</h2>
<p>Spread the love! Dish out the lower-level tasks such as basic sound design, recording (even the cleaning) etc., to someone that costs less for you to pay in terms of money than it would cost for you in time. <a style="font-weight: normal;" href="../../../2009/07/you-need-help-or-do-you-part-i.html" target="_blank">Deane Ogden&#8217;s post here</a> gives way more useful information on this than ever I could!</p>
<h2>In Conclusion&#8230;</h2>
<p>I realise that getting the work through the door is often a tricky enough prospect without worrying about how to juggle several projects at once. However, once you&#8217;re in that situation it&#8217;ll be very useful to have a couple of strategies in place to stay in control&#8230; and still enjoy the process!</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t forget to turn your phone, email and Tweetdeck back on when your done. There may be another project lined up just waiting for you to accept it <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sig-fenoughty1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-670" title="sig-fenoughty" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sig-fenoughty1.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>Just a quick question for the thousands of lovely SCOREcast readers out there:</div>
<div><strong>What&#8217;s your batting average? </strong></div>
<div>Or, rather, how many minutes of finished music can you crank out in a day?</div>
<div><em>Note: for &#8216;crank out&#8217;, read: craft, create, splurge, sketch, mix, master, etc. &#8211; I&#8217;m being deliberately vague here to leave the forum open <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </em></div>
<div>It&#8217;s important for planning your workflow and schedule to know what your average is. I read in the comments (really sorry, can&#8217;t find it for the moment!) for one of the recent posts here on SCOREcast that one chap knows what his music-making output is <em>per hour</em> &#8211; that&#8217;s super-aware!</div>
<div>I know for a fact that I make more usable music in the earlier hours of the day, and that later hours are best used for more low-level tasks, admin etc, so this hourly rate varies so much to not be a useful tool for me&#8230; but is it for you?</div>
<div>Also, on longer projects (as Deane et al have already stated) as the musical themes and flavour get under your skin, writing gets faster towards the end of the project. This is useful to know if only for your sanity at the start of the project when you&#8217;re looking at a blank sequence!</div>
<div>But, on the whole, knowing your daily <em>average</em> is most useful, I find. I know that on one day I may only make 2 minutes of decent score and the rest is waffle, but on another day there may be a new 10-minutes-worth of glorious musical loveliness, mixed and mastered, perfectly synced to score (though, trust me, this is more rare <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />  ). I can&#8217;t predict from one day to the next which it&#8217;ll be, but I do know that over a period of time, say, a month, it&#8217;ll be clearer what the per-day average is, and I can use that to plan the next project.</div>
<div>I used to average about a minute (if I&#8217;m completely honest, that was on a good day, if you know what I mean) when I first started out many years ago. Now it&#8217;s up to about 5 minutes or so.</div>
<div>So, let me know: what&#8217;s <em><strong>your</strong></em> batting average?</div>

<p>Admittedly this is my point of view, a conclusion drawn of my life experiences so far. They may change in the next ten years.  But, hey, so far being a bit of a <strong>&#8216;One-Man-Band&#8217;</strong> has worked for me, so it might just work for you<br />
 <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<h3>FOCUS</h3>
<p>Focusing on music and composition, and film music in particular, has never really been a problem for me. In fact, it&#8217;s practically borderline obsession. I cannot remember a time when I didn&#8217;t want to write or be involved somehow with the music of film.<br />
This led me to learn various instruments and then onto two music degrees, the latter in scoring picture, an invaluable experience, as it was here where I learned the similarities between composing music pieces and sound designing an entire soundtrack, using found or recorded sound to augment music or even be the basis for it.<br />
I took my narrow focus on just scoring film to the wider possibilities of, and the fun to be had with, film sound.<br />
After university I found even more so that diversifying my skill set led on to more contacts and opportunities. Recording sound on low budget short film sets led to an appreciation of well-recorded sound when I then brought them into the post-production studio&#8230; and also the necessity of learning ways of cleaning up less than optimal sound (that I vowed to record better the next time!).<br />
Using organizational and basic office skills as a production assistant in a local, small production office meant I also ended up being first choice for the recording and post-production sound, simply out of convenience for the producers, and they could pay me as a package deal, probably ending up cheaper for them than sourcing it out to separate facility houses.</p>
<h3>SKILLS</h3>
<p>Even if your office skills are pretty limited, the fact that you&#8217;re a composing for film means that you&#8217;ve got a pretty broad skillset in other areas as it is. In the beginning it&#8217;s vital to use them all to get you to that holy grail of composing for film (or theatre, television, commercials, whatever floats your boat).<br />
You&#8217;re probably pretty good with computers and related kit &#8211; get work in kit hire, and find out about all the films that are hiring kit perhaps by making friends with your regular clients.<br />
If you&#8217;ve been freelance or self-employed for any length of time, you&#8217;ll develop some pretty awesome motivational and organizational skills (if you don&#8217;t you won&#8217;t be in work very long!). How might you put those to good use in some line of work that may put you in the line of fire for a composing role? Or even pay the bills so you have enough free time to compose music and build up your credits?<br />
I found that working in music sequencers and timelines actually translates well to working in Macromedia Flash, which led to designing my own fancy website and then a few more for friends and friends of friends. After realizing that Flash websites get no love from search engines, some of the coding skills used in Flash translate over to working in html etc., which led to a little more web design.  Maybe you could design websites to fund your addiction to writing music for film?<br />
You probably play at least one instrument. Whether it&#8217;s through teaching or playing at functions, there&#8217;s easy cash to be made there, with very little time investment involved. You&#8217;ve already put in all the hard work learning to play the damn thing&#8230;<br />
Honestly&#8230; at the very least being able to offer not only composition but sound design, foley, and mixes on short films and contemporary theatre really has gotten me more work. If I can offer it as a package, I save the client hassle and quite a bit of dosh. It&#8217;s gotten me more credits, more contacts and lots more word-of-mouth recommendations than if all I could do was crank out the tunes.<br />
Or at the very least, it&#8217;s kept the roof over my head. And, let&#8217;s face it, more importantly, my studio. <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<h3>JACK OF ALL TRADES?</h3>
<p>Does diversifying mean you become a &#8216;jack of all trades, master of none&#8217;? This really depends on you: how far are you willing to go to get the opportunities to put your foot on the ladder, or even later down the line, to continue to work in the industry when the credit crunch finally hits your neck of the woods (though this has yet to happen in mine, and I&#8217;m keeping fingers crossed it&#8217;ll continue this way. However, you never know what the future may bring &#8211; it&#8217;s always good to have contingencies!)?<br />
The trick is to not worry too much about being the greatest in the world at every single one of the skills you offer, but instead aim to be the best you can be at the ones you love and at least pretty competent at the ones that pay.<br />
Face it, even if you work only on composition, out of the billions of people on the planet there will always be someone who&#8217;s better than you, after all!<br />
Embrace this knowledge, work hard at getting better and enjoy the journey.<br />
Focus 100% on your role in the project at hand, learn everything you can from the experience, give it all you&#8217;ve got and you&#8217;ll come away from the experience better at that role than you were before. You may also come away feeling like you never want to do it again&#8230; but that&#8217;s a whole other post waiting to be written&#8230;<br />
<strong>FULL CIRCLE<br />
</strong><br />
It&#8217;s even got to the point now where I have so much work on, I&#8217;m able to outsource a little of the basic stuff like tracklaying and simple foley&#8230; which means I have more time to focus on the music, the sound design, the experimentation, the fun stuff, and so the client still gets more bang for their buck.<br />
Which (hopefully!) leads to even more word-of-mouth recommendations!<br />
I started with composition and will probably end my career there, for that&#8217;s where my true passion lies, but I would never have got there had I not diversified and got as much mileage out of the associated skills as I have.<br />
And I certainly wouldn&#8217;t have had as much fun along the way. Variety is, after all, the spice of life.<br />
Sometimes it&#8217;s good to be a one-man-band.</p>
