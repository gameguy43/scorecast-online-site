Ski (a.k.a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.peterschwartzmusic.com\"><span class=\"s2\">Peter Schwartz<\/span><\/a>) is a composer, orchestrator, and arranger whose long and impressive career has allowed him to work with artists such as Madonna, Michael Jackson, David Bowie, Mariah Carey and Pet Shop Boys to name a few, and his scoring clients include Disneytoons, Mattel, FOX, Warner Bros and many more. Peter Schwartz is also one of MacProVideo\u2019s most pre-eminent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macprovideo.com\/about\/trainers\/peterschwartz\"><span class=\"s2\">Logic Pro instructors<\/span><\/a> and has produced Logic-oriented courses in MIDI Orchestration, Template Building and Score Editing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Throughout all his musical escapades for the past 25+ years Ski has been loyal to Logic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>and is one of the few people on this planet who actually really know Logic inside-out. Thriving to always improve his workflow and make the best out of Logic, Ski has listened to all of our prayers and created something that can be easily called the equivalent of \u201cVST Expression Maps\u201d for Logic Pro. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>General Overview<\/h2>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Peter developed his original version of SkiSwitcher in 2008 out of frustration that keyswitching patches didn&#8217;t always play back with the correct articulation. This is a problem you\u2019re probably familiar with, too! Though the original version of the system solved this problem, the newly-introduced scripting capabilities of Logic Pro X allowed him to both simplify its operation and greatly expand its capabilities beyond just working with keyswitching patches.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">SkiSwitcher2 is an articulation switching system that allows you compose and produce music without having to worry about: <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">learning the keyswitches of each different library you own;<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">navigating a project with 300+ tracks because you need to host each articulation on a different track; <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">having to play your work back from a specific point because keyswitches don\u2019t \u2018chase\u2019;<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">having to spend hours to \u2018clean up\u2019 your project in order to print out a usable score after you\u2019ve already spent hours composing the actual music.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Key Features<\/h2>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So let\u2019s look at what SkiSwitcher2 can actually do for you: <\/span><\/p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Intelligent Keyswitching<\/strong>: <\/span><span class=\"s1\">When using a keyswitch patch (e.g. CS2, EWQL keyswitch patches etc), you usually need to be very careful when playing back your work because keyswitch notes don\u2019t work if they are not included within the playback passage. With SkiSwitcher2, the notes of your music select their own articulations. In other words, information about the appropriate articulation is \u2018embedded\u2019 into each note and no matter where in the timeline you choose to playback your work from, all notes will play back using the correct articulations.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Polyphonic Keyswitching<\/strong>: <\/span><span class=\"s1\">With SkiSwitcher2 you can play chords and set each chord note to play back using a different articulation. <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Articulation Name Display<\/strong>: <\/span><span class=\"s1\">SkiSwitcher2 not only allows you to enter a specific label for each articulation you use but it also displays the articulation name in real time. This way, you no longer have to play the guessing game when playing a line with a keyswitching patch; you know exactly what you are playing every single moment.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Taming the track-count beast<\/strong>: <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Let\u2019s face it; having to scroll through five screens\u2019 worth of tracks while riding the inspiration wave is not very productive. Non-keyswitching libraries (e.g. LASS, some EWQL libraries etc) dictate that you have to use 1 track per articulation thus significantly increasing your track count. SkiSwitcher2 offers you a way to combine up to 16 different articulations into a single track, essentially allowing you to treat a multi-timbral plugin like Play or KONTAKT as a single keyswitching patch. How cool is that? <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Hybrid Instruments<\/strong>: <\/span><span class=\"s1\">These are special a special kind of instrument setup that let you override articulations that you don\u2019t use in keyswitching patches and \u2018replace\u2019 them with individual articulations from other patches.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Consistent Keyswitches<\/strong>: <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Having to learn the keyswitches of each different library you use is daunting to say the least. SkiSwitcher2 provides a solution to this problem, too, by allowing you set a universal key range as your keyswitching range and apply this to every library you use. Additionally, if you have a 2nd keyboard lying around, you can easily incorporate this into your setup and use it for keyswitching purposes.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Easy Score creation<\/strong>: <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Since you no longer have to include keyswitch notes in your MIDI regions, score creation becomes a much easier and more straight-forward affair.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Installation<\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 4\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div id=\"attachment_2256\" style=\"width: 399px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2256\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2256 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/1-389x194.png\" alt=\"1\" width=\"389\" height=\"194\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/1-389x194.png 389w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/1-300x150.png 300w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/1.png 395w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2256\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">fig. 1: Installation<\/p><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Before we move on, let me clarify that although I\u2019ve been using Logic since early 2009, I was completely and utterly unfamiliar with anything Script-like until getting my hands on SkiSwitcher2. If you are a script-newbie like myself, you are in good hands because Peter Schwartz has gone to great lengths to make make sure the Scripter can be configured entirely from its front panel, and that end-users never have to do any coding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">SkiSwitcher2 comes in a neatly organized folder, including everything you need to get up and running in no time:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">A video installation guide that takes you through the process step-by-step.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Three different PDF documents explaining everything about how SkiSwitcher2 works, how to make it work for you and offering tips and tricks on how to actually implement it into your own setup. <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">The SkiSwitcher2 logic project file that you need to open in order to obtain the SkiSwitcher2 script; and<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">A \u201cCC Cloner\u201d KONTAKT preset file to help you set up SkiSwitcher2 with KONTAKT-based libraries. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Following the instructions outlined in the installation guide video I was able to install SkiSwitcher2 easily and without any problems whatsoever.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">In Action<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Since I am hosting all my libraries on a separate slave PC, Vienna Ensemble Pro is a key ingredient in my workflow and I was anxious to see how SkiSwitcher2 would work in this<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>slightly complicated setup. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Below, I will explore how SkiSwitcher2 worked in three different situations: with keyswitching patches, with multi-timbral instruments and when incorporated into an existing template.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">I. SKISWITCHER2 AND KEYSWITCHING PATCHES<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Setting up SkiSwitcher2 with a keyswitching patch took me all of 5 minutes. After having installed SkiSwitcher2 as per the Installation video\u2019s instructions, I loaded a violin keyswitching patch from EWQL Symphony Orchestral library (18V KS Master) and loaded the Scripter plugin in Logic, with the appropriate SkiSwitcher2 preset. <\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2257\" style=\"width: 313px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2257\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2257\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2.png\" alt=\"2\" width=\"303\" height=\"455\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2257\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">fig 2: Scripter<\/p><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Since SkiSwitcher2 offers real-time articulation display, I spent a couple of minutes entering all the articulation names included in the 18V KS Master patch.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Then, it was just a matter of playing the melody with my right hand and the articulations on the left. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Each articulation I played was neatly<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>displayed on the Scripter interface. Since PLAY is hosted on an external slave PC, this was extremely useful because it eliminated my need to constantly look at a second screen to see what articulation I am playing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The resulting MIDI region simply included the melody notes and absolutely no keyswitching notes. Every bit of information needed to trigger the correct articulation was embedded into the notes themselves, via the MIDI channel. If you look at the event list of the MIDI region, you\u2019ll see the MIDI channels changing to reflect the different articulations I was triggering at each<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>point. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Figure 3 shows how the score would look:<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2259\" style=\"width: 630px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2259\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2259 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/5-640x74.png\" alt=\"5\" width=\"620\" height=\"72\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/5-640x74.png 640w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/5-389x45.png 389w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/5-300x35.png 300w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/5.png 1149w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2259\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">fig 3: Score output<\/p><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This phrase goes through 7 articulation changes and there are absolutely NO keyswitches present in the score! <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Needless to say that when I played it back, all parts played correctly and absolutely no note-chasing was needed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">II. SKISWITCHER2 AND MULTI-TIMBRAL PLUGINS <\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Setting up SkiSwitcher2 with a multi-timbral instance took me 10 minutes, including the 4 minutes I spent brewing a new cup of coffee!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After loading 7 different LASS 2 lite Violin I articulations in a single KONTAKT instance, I loaded SkiSwitcher2 and this time I selected the \u201cMulti-Timbral\u201d option. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This works in the exact same way as described in the previous version. The only difference is that the different channels now represent different patches loaded in the instrument plugin and not keyswitches present in the same patch. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To take it a step further, SkiSwitcher 2 allows the creation of a special kind of instruments, the so-called \u201c<\/span><span class=\"s2\">Hybrid<\/span><span class=\"s1\">\u201d instruments. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Imagine this: there is a specific keyswitching patch from EWQL Orchestra that you absolutely love but you find the legatos a tad lacking. What you can now do with the help of SkiSwitcher2 is load this keyswitching patch and then not only override (i.e. exclude) the articulations you don\u2019t like (i.e. the legato) but also use another patch in their place essentially creating a hybrid instrument comprising of different patches even from different libraries!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">III. SKISWITCHER2 AND POLYPHONIC KEYSWITCHING <\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2261\" style=\"width: 399px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2261\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2261 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/7-389x386.png\" alt=\"7\" width=\"389\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/7-389x386.png 389w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/7-640x636.png 640w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/7-300x298.png 300w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/7.png 748w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2261\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">fig 4: Event List<\/p><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Here\u2019s where things start to get <\/span><span class=\"s2\">really<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> interesting. SkiSwitcher2 allows you to play chords and then assign a different articulation to each note of the chord.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This can work in either the Keyswitching or Multi-Timbral patch type and all you have to do is play your chords and then assign the correct channel using the Event List. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Figure 4 shows two chords C and G\/D: The root of the first chord is assigned to channel 1 and plays the legato articulation as expected. The E is assigned to channel 2 and plays a trill legato patch and the G which is held during both chords plays a tremolo legato patch. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This approach could also be extremely helpful if you wanted to quickly assign a MIDI region played with a Strings Ensemble patch, to the individual string sections. Simply create an instance of your plugin with Violins 1 = channel 1, Violins 2 = channel 2, Violas = channel 3 etc and assign each note to the section you wish to be played by.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">IV. THE CC CLONER<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Last but not least, Schwartz has made sure to include an intuitive way to handle CC messages in SkiSwitcher2. We all know that without our CC11 faders and modulation wheels, we<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>cannot possibly imagine creating a realistic MIDI orchestration. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Using a component called \u201cCC Cloner\u201d (included in the SkiSwitcher2 download),<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>you can now choose to \u2018clone\u2019 the CC messages recorded on the first channel of the keyswitching or multi-timbral instrument, to all the rest of the channels. <\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2262\" style=\"width: 351px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2262\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2262\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/8-640x409.png\" alt=\"8\" width=\"341\" height=\"220\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/8-620x400.png 620w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/8-300x194.png 300w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/8-85x54.png 85w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2262\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">fig. 5: CC Cloner<\/p><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For example, say I have a KONTAKT instance loaded with 7 different articulations of LASS 2 Lite Violin I patches.
