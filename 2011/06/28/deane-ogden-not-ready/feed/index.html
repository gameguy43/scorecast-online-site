 worked in multiple jobs at the same time to finance school, rent, 
insurance and food ever since I was 21 years old - until I could finally finance myself by writing music. And I know other people who had to do the same because their parents simply didn&#039;t have enough money for support. Laying back and letting your parents pay is just the easy way to go and I sincerely think that one appreciates a lot of things more later on if one takes the hard way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s true that every successful composer you talk to will have a different story of how they got to where they are, but the idea of the list is a bare minimum of what you need in a situation where nobody&#039;s handing anything to you. I believe Deane is trying to give a list of negative skill-based and attitude-based attributes that may become obstacles if you don&#039;t address them early on. As for the tone of the article, while it may seem harsh, I think it&#039;s meant to humble you. If you&#039;re not willing to be humbled, you&#039;re not ready.]]></description>

Good for you for getting it done and seeing it through to the finish! THAT, in and of itself, is a huge feat!

		<description><![CDATA[Absolutely right, Debra! It&#039;s ALL about your perspective. Sometimes, you just need a slight paradigm shift in the way that you perceive certain things. Are they obstacles or opportunities to be better, and thus, more competitive? A person can only decide that for themselves. (Great to see you here, by the way! Your website and services are awesome!) :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But just because &quot;you&#039;re not ready&quot; does that mean you should sit on your bum until you&#039;re ready?  NO!  This is really just a list to use when identifying where you are in your learning curve.  It&#039;s a process.  And the only way to get ready is to get in action.

Some of the items in this list have to do with lack of skills (time management, organization, working with a team, etc.) - and you can learn new skills.

Some of these items have to do with emotional intelligence (dealing with fear, pouting when people tell you &quot;no&quot;) - and these are also skills that can be learned.

A lot of what&#039;s on this list, however have to do with mindset (wanting to be famous, thinking your irreplaceable, illegally downloading software - otherwise known as ETHICS) - and this underlies everything.  If you don&#039;t have an entrepreneurial mindset, you will likely not put in the time, effort or commitment it will take to get ready.  But you can change your mind - just think different thoughts...]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>But just because &#8220;you&#8217;re not ready&#8221; does that mean you should sit on your bum until you&#8217;re ready?  NO!  This is really just a list to use when identifying where you are in your learning curve.  It&#8217;s a process.  And the only way to get ready is to get in action.</p>
<p>Some of the items in this list have to do with lack of skills (time management, organization, working with a team, etc.) &#8211; and you can learn new skills.</p>
<p>Some of these items have to do with emotional intelligence (dealing with fear, pouting when people tell you &#8220;no&#8221;) &#8211; and these are also skills that can be learned.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Bravo, Deane!

If you can&#039;t see this list as a series of milestones to be achieved rather than obstacles that are implacable, you&#039;re not ready.  ;)Seriously, Deane has just handed down a to-do list for anyone who is wondering how to &#039;be ready&#039; (for the &#039;big time&#039;).  It should provide a sense of peace to anyone who feels frustrated (hey, that includes me and probably the rest of you!) at not being able to get to the next level--why, we ask, aren&#039;t the opportunities being handed to us?  Here&#039;s a list of why.  It&#039;s not a list that should daunt you; rather, it should excite you.  Here&#039;s a sampling of what you need to master.  Savor those milestones, think about them, and work towards them.  Furthermore, during the process of mastery, you should not be hard on yourself for not having suddenly fast-forwarded 10 years to success.  If you&#039;re hard down on yourself at the beginning and in the middle, firstly, you are hampering your progress, and secondly, if and when you do make it, you will not have learned how to be happy during the process, and will expect happiness only at the conclusion.  This will lead you to never being happy.  (think of your favorite tortured-soul celebrity.  Mine is Jim Carrey, although, I think he&#039;s happier these days.  I hope so.)  However, there IS no conclusion--there is no creative professional who isn&#039;t striving to do something bigger, better, or different (maybe &#039;smaller&#039;!) with their work.  As for me, I&#039;m not quite ready.  In my mind, being ready is kind of like the Buddhist conception of enlightenment--there are lots of levels of &#039;readiness&#039; to achieve.  Maybe I&#039;m at Ready 0.9 , but when I get to Ready 1.1, that is legwork for Ready 2.0.  (You are welcome to debate these semantics.)]]></description>

If you have already seen your name in lights and walking the red carpet....your not ready

If you weep salty tears of sadness because no one &#039;facebook liked&#039; your last piece...your not ready.

&#039;Who the hell is Ennio Morricone and Bernard Herrmann anyway&#039;...your not ready.

If you start writing massive brass pomp and everything starts to sound like &#039;The Planets&#039;...you may be related to John Williams but either way...your not ready.

If you think doubling up every string motif with a Wagner section will elevate you to Zimmer greatness.....take a lie down....your not ready.
