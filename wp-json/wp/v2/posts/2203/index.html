An ambitious statement, but when you see the awards Sample\u00a0Logic has received since the company began putting together its catalogue of interesting sound\u00a0libraries back in 2006, you see how it can support this claim. <em><strong>Cinematic Keys<\/strong><\/em> offers a lot more than the title suggests, and is a perfect example of Sample\u00a0Logic&#8217;s motto; it covers realistic\u00ad sounding traditional keyboard instruments, crossing over into\u00a0score\u00ad-ready, dark hybrid sound design.\u00a0Sample Logic spent a great deal of time recording instruments in an orthodox way and then, quite\u00a0literally, destroying the instruments with an array of power tools to create truly original and\u00a0innovative sounds. Whether you are a bedroom producer or a well established composer,\u00a0Cinematic Keys is great for any genre you are creating.<\/p>\n<p>The library is available for the free Kontakt player and the retail version 5.3.1 or higher, delivered\u00a0at 44.1k \/ 24bit. It costs US$350 and takes up a mere 8gb of hard drive space.<\/p>\n<h2>Interface<\/h2>\n<p>The basic layout of Cinematic Keys is clear and it is very simple to navigate through the menus.\u00a0Instruments and multis are split into three main sections, with an additional three under each\u00a0category. Atmospheres, instrumentals and percussives belong to the instrument section, while construction\u00a0beds, instrument stacks and One\u00ad-Note Glory reside under the multi page.<\/p>\n<p>Sample Logic has enhanced the original award winning Kontakt interface with a more\u00a0aesthetically pleasing GUI. Each instrument can access eight real\u00adtime audio effects all with a\u00a0user friendly tiled appearance.\u00a0When you click on each tile, an additional menu will appear with more customisation at your\u00a0disposal. The interface includes a bypass ArpeggiGator, Triggers with 64 preset effects, an LFO\u00a0section and the powerful Step Animator engine.\u00a0Cinematic Keys is the first library to have the new evolved FX animator, which allows all audio\u00a0effects to be modulated and sequenced in real time, enabling brand new creative ways of writing\u00a0and performing sounds.<\/p>\n<p>With 150 presets, the modulation can be used on a per step basis,\u00a0different durations for each step and synchronised to the animator engine, making Cinematic\u00a0Keys one of the most innovative libraries to date.<\/p>\n<h2>Sound<\/h2>\n<p>Whether you prefer to work in the realms of sound design, enjoy producing slamming EDM tracks,\u00a0or strive to create epic orchestral scores, Cinematic Keys offers something for everyone.\u00a0Under the menu instrumentals you have the choice of pianos, harpsichords, organs and other\u00a0various keyboard based instruments.\u00a0The percussives feature\u00a0hit ensembles, impacts, loops, transitions and sequences, while the\u00a0atmospheres feature\u00a0stingers and ambiences.<\/p>\n<p>I enjoy the &#8220;Grand Strum&#8221;, as it is a timbre you don&#8217;t tend to hear in a piano library, whereas the\u00a0arps and &#8220;Pianos Effectual&#8221; can really help achieve an ominous mood \u2014 something you can rely on\u00a0when creating a tension based score.\u00a0&#8220;Caged Animal&#8221; is just downright disgusting! It sounds like something straight out of Saw or Silent\u00a0Hill, and is\u00ad one of my personal favourites.<\/p>\n<h2>Editing<\/h2>\n<p>When using Cinematic Keys, you can find what you are looking for very easily, whether it\u2019s a tone\u00a0you know well, or you want to go that little bit deeper and edit various settings like the LFO or\u00a0wave shape.<\/p>\n<p>It can be a tedious process when you\u2019re playing around and trying to create an original sound or\u00a0tone with absolutely no idea what you\u2019re doing, especially with the more technical features in\u00a0sample libraries. However, customising the arps in Cinematic Keys felt effortless, and I achieved a\u00a0personal sound with minimal effort. Everything is laid out in such a user friendly way, whilst still\u00a0remaining easy on the eyes. I am personally a big fan of creating and implementing arps into my\u00a0own tracks, and the arpeggiated sounds of &#8220;Out of the Box&#8221; work really well.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2205\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/Screen-Shot-2014-12-06-at-12.01.23-PM-389x285.png\" alt=\"Cinematic Keys - SCOREcast Online\" width=\"389\" height=\"285\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/Screen-Shot-2014-12-06-at-12.01.23-PM-389x285.png 389w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/Screen-Shot-2014-12-06-at-12.01.23-PM-640x469.png 640w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/Screen-Shot-2014-12-06-at-12.01.23-PM-300x220.png 300w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/Screen-Shot-2014-12-06-at-12.01.23-PM.png 1083w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When using the software, I found myself breaking out of my regular writing habits and experimenting in ways that I wouldn&#8217;t have tried before. Personally, I feel this is a good thing,\u00a0especially when you hit that creative block.<\/p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>The overall quality of sound and architecture of Cinematic Keys is incredibly consistent across the\u00a0board. It appeals to a wide audience, and with an innovative interface, live performance capabilities\u00a0and a user friendly design, the US$350 price tag is definitely money well \u00adspent.<\/p>\n<p>Strictly speaking, Cinematic Keys is a contemporary library and, from what I&#8217;ve experienced, it\u00a0caters better to producers and sound designers rather than to composers.\u00a0As with anything that is contemporary, a fair portion of it will date eventually, but I&#8217;m sure that\u00a0won&#8217;t be an issue any time soon.\u00a0You can achieve great sounds with the smallest amount of effort and delve in deeper with all the\u00a0popular customisation tools whilst making use of Sample Logic&#8217;s original FX animator.<\/p>\n<p>If you are on the hunt for a library that makes an impact, offers a great range of keyboard\u00a0instruments, and creates sinister atmospheres with plenty of customisation tools at your fingertips, Cinematic Keys is the sample library for you.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>Cinematic Keys<\/strong>\u00a0by <a title=\"Sample Logic\" href=\"http:\/\/samplelogic.com\" target=\"_blank\">Sample Logic<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>$350<\/strong>\u00a0(MSRP)<br \/>\nPowered by full retail\u00a0<strong>Native Instruments Kontakt<\/strong> or the free<strong> Kontakt Player<br \/>\n<\/strong>Purchase Cinematic Keys\u00a0or listen to demos at <a title=\"Sample Logic\" href=\"http:\/\/samplelogic.com\" target=\"_blank\">samplelogic.com<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cinematic Keys offers a lot more than the title suggests, covering realistic\u00ad sounding traditional keyboard instruments while crossing over into score\u00ad-ready, dark hybrid sound design.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":45,"featured_media":2204,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_is_tweetstorm":false},"categories":[1307],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/samplelogic-sco.jpg","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p202Ia-zx","_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2203"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/45"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2203"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2203\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2204"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2203"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2203"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2203"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
