		<description>Unfortunately, your budget will dictate where you record these days. If you have a healthy studio budget, you may be able to record in Los Angeles, but it will need to be a union group. If not, you can record under a buy-out agreement in Prague, Bratislava, Moscow, London... many places—even certain spots here in the USA.

But...

The pros and cons of union vs. non-union are varied. For many composers, it boils down to the sound. LA/New York players are amazing. So are London players, but to me, LA&#039;s are better, and I don&#039;t say that as boosterism for the LA recording community. I&#039;ve just found it to be true for the types of films I&#039;ve scored. I&#039;ve also recorded oversees, and while it was a great experience, if I had my way, I&#039;d record here at home 100% of the time. Like I said, though, YOUR way and the budget&#039;s way might be two different things, and you have to do what makes financial sense for the project. There are many initiatives under way in the States to try and preserve the composer&#039;s ability to keep things at home, but it is a slow-going process and one that requires a lot of fight from many groups of people in order to pull off.

		<description>There are so many things that tick seconds off the clock in a session, including (but not limited to) ProTools snafus, microphone/seating placement issues that need fixing, blown takes, intonation problems that need addressing (thus you must start the take over again), click track/headphone problems, mandatory breaks, playbacks (listening back to a recorded take to see if you have what you need so you can move on), etc. The list could go on and on depending on the situation/group/studio/engineer/contractor/music.</description>

		<description>Thank you for clarifying this, Mark. I&#039;m certainly no expert on union rates and percentages, and as a contractor I&#039;m sure you deal with those issues daily. Your input here is priceless, so if you have more, please weigh in.</description>

		<description>Hey Bruce! I&#039;m so glad you&#039;re here!

I know I could have been much clearer with this, but in the example, I&#039;m going off of the budget at hand. The amount of music any person will get from the example budget &quot;is what it is&quot;. The point of the illustration is to show how much or how little one can produce given *that* budget, making it critical that you carefully mind your resources and be very smart about planning and executing. If a person can only get 4 minutes of music out of that budget, then that&#039;s what they are left with. However, with careful planning and executing, you can probably get more... we all have. Given the hundreds of episodes of television that you yourself have written beautiful music for, I would bet that you are a master of stretching the dollar to accommodate budgets of all kinds. ;-)

This is just a guide. You could take this budget over to Prague or Bratislava and it would expand exponentially. Conversely, this budget here in Los Angeles might not get you much more than a half-hour with a string quartet and a couple of In &#039;n Out burgers!

Everyone needs to understand that there are several things that go into EVERY score that make the budgeting subjective on many levels. We haven&#039;t even started talking about &quot;favors&quot; and price breaks for certain tasks or from certain people in your life that you&#039;ve worked with for years.</description>

		<description>Deane......I just happened on this article and have a question. How can the $900.00 cover an orchestrator for anything more than a few pages? Strings for 1 cue could end up costing the $900.00 and more. Copying at $800.00 is also making me wonder how this can be done. I&#039;m assuming i&#039;m missing something here, so if you could clarify, I won&#039;t have to think i&#039;m losing my mind. Thanks!

		<description>Hey, thanks for such a great informative article! But i wonder one thing though. How come only five minutes of music gets recorded out of 45? I get that musicians must read through the score and the like but what is the main time consumer? Maybe i didn&#039;t read careful enough and maybe you have posted the information answering my question on your next article but here i go anyways.

Deane, great article as usual, but you left out a few things.  Especially when dealing with orchestral musicians for  &quot;indie&quot; films.

If the session is AFM, there are way more prices for a 3-hr session, then the $262 price you quoted  There is full-budget (what you quoted (which in reality is $266 for 3 hrs), which are films budgeted at $45m or more.. so that doesn&#039;t apply in your cost scenario.

In addition to that full-budget scale there are low-budget ($191) for $15-44.9m budgets , ultra-low budget ($164) for under $15m and under $2m (depending on size of group) and even &quot;Festival Film&quot; ($105) for under $1m budget films which would require an upgrade upon distribution.

Also there are AFM benefits to be considered which you did not mention, 10.4% pension (on wages) and approx $25 per player, per day, h/w.

payroll taxes can range from 18-23% and payroll fee ares 2-3% Those fees are on wages alone.

Typically principal players get 1.5x or 2x scale as well but that is not contractual.

I hope that helps..

		<description>Absolutely great article Deane.  As someone that&#039;s just starting out, this is great information!  Thanks really.  I do have a question though regarding musicians, using union or non-union.  When are you required to use union musicians and what are the pros and cons to using them or not using them.  Maybe it could be a topic for another article.  </description>

		<description>Really great and thanks for being brave enough to put actual (in my opinion real world) numbers on things.  One thing to add to this equation of &quot;what will I make as a composer&quot; is of course back end (residuals, royalties, whatever you wanna call them).  And although you mention in your article that you are dissecting up front costs, you can get a much better sense of what you will inevitably make if you factor in some of your back end expectations-up front-so to speak.  An indie film in my experience often doesn&#039;t make a ton (if any) back end unless the producers are able to get the film good air play on cable (good) or network (even better but unlikely).  If you want to make money as a composer, you simply have to get your music on TV, somehow, somewhere, as often as possible.  So what started out as about $15k in profit can end up being many thousands of additional dollars if you are able to get good air play from your indie film.  Remember you won&#039;t see a dime from DVD sales, rentals and there are no residuals for theater play in the US.  Foreign territories are different and do pay for theatrical performances although every territory is different.  In addition, another important thing I would add to your list of considerations is &quot;can I own this music&quot;?  Meaning, can I take this music I write for this film and exploit it, wether that means in a music library or license it to other clients throughout my career.  This language would have to be included in the contract you sign with the producer of the film.  If you are able to own your music,  you will then have the power to control your music and continue to make money from the licensing of your music.  Not to mention doubling your residuals for all airings of the indie film as publisher of the music.  This can be a major revenue stream.  The major caveat with respect to Dean&#039;s example is that using a union string section will very likely limit your options in exploiting the music to generate future income since every reuse will require an additional payment to the musicians and in the real world you&#039;ll have a tough time making the math work.  Unless of course your licensing clients are paying big bucks (like trailer usage) and then kudos to you.  If your score is all synths and samples or non-union then you will have more options to exploit your music for additional income.  I&#039;m not against using union guys in recording music, I&#039;m simply stating a fact that using them will have an impact on your freedom to place your music in other projects.  I think since budgets are so tight these days, that thinking about alternate ways to exploit and control and profit from music you have already written is more important than ever and especially important for young composers to consider as they start writing music.</description>

		<description>Hey David!Well, I&#039;m not sure you&#039;ll like this answer... but unfortunately, I don&#039;t believe there are ANY &quot;stereotypical&quot; scenarios in our business. I spoke with an upper A-list composer this morning on the phone who told me that he just took a 3rd sequel to a well-known studio franchise and is scoring it for less than $60,000... all in. He stands to make anywhere from 10k to 20k depending on how he pulls off this particular score. However, he also will be scoring one of the year&#039;s hottest movies in October to the tune of $975,000. So there ya go!All of the numbers you&#039;ve offered here can be calculated out at the rates that I&#039;ve presented. I&#039;d say give yourself a 15% over/under just to be safe. As I stated in the original article, there are really so many variables to budgeting for a score that it is literally impossible to draw out all of the possible scenarios. We could lay out several hypothetical situations only to have the director then want two tubas and a mandolin!Someone else here might have a better perspective.Anyone, anyone? Bueller?</description>

		<description>Another great article, Deane. Since you&#039;re asking for questions, I&#039;ll bite.
I&#039;d be interested in the stereotypical scenarios in which one would find themselves walking away with $500, $2000, $8,000, $32,000, $128,000, or $512,000 when a project finishes. I&#039;m just using multiples of 4 here for some breadth, so if there are better divisions to draw, feel free. I&#039;m just trying to draw out of you some distinctive characteristics about projects composers can be aware of to know where it falls in the financial spectrum.</description>

		<description>Thank you for writing this article Deane. It answers and addresses many of the questions and concerns new and emerging film score composers MUST know about *before* getting started in the industry. I appreciate your candid honesty and ability to allow your readers to get a first-hand glimpse into the real world of a film composer. You are a rare treasure of knowledge and wisdom, and a true inspiration to me. </description>

... Additionally, the house hasn&#039;t offered &quot;Half Off Tuesdays&quot; in a long, long time, either! The prices for getting the work done aren&#039;t getting any lower. In fact, they increase with every passing year—which makes your point here even more pertinent to those currently working to get their start in the business.

Strategically planning your entrance has never been more critical to future success in this game. The business is changing daily. It&#039;s not just the composing side, but every aspect of the film industry—even the studios don&#039;t know how to program for the current audience. We are all trying to figure it out together. It sort of reminds me a scene from Hitchcock&#039;s &quot;Lifeboat&quot;!

Take Bellis&#039; advice: Take it easy, do your homework, make sound choices as you make your way in. It&#039;s a jungle in here!</description>

		<description>Hey Zion—&lt;br&gt;Great to see you here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe I should clarify a bit. I know you are a pop producer more than a film composer, and in that case, yes... samples work just fine. When I produce sessions for people, we always use samples and nine times out of ten those samples make it all the way to the final mix.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, in film work, it is pretty widely held that samples don&#039;t stack up in the face of an actual orchestra, which is what I&#039;m referring to in this article. You can get away with sampled drums all day long, but a sampled clarinet, viola, or trumpet? Not so much. In most film score situations, the desire is to replace the sample with a live instrument.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I agree that manipulating samples is an art in and of itself. Even still, samples are samples. There&#039;s only so far you can go with them before you simply run out of material to manipulate. They are only as good as their source recordings, and in an orchestral situation, that just isn&#039;t ever good enough. I could be a master of sample manipulation, but an instrument in the hands of a seasoned player will quickly put those skills into perspective.</description>

		<description>Hide yo kids, hide yo wife... 

But seriously, great post Deane.  I slightly disagree with your view of sampled sounds though... I think a lot of samples kill live instruments now, and sometimes fit the film better....  not to mention SO much more economical.  But of course it&#039;s a whole skill in and of itself to know how to use samples in the form of instrumentation.  </description>

		<description>Hey Deane,
It&#039;s great to hear someone else tackle these issues!  Thanks for taking it on.  You&#039;re on the money as usual.
The followup question to &quot;How much money will I make as a film composer?&quot; is, of course, &quot;How much should I invest in becoming a film composer?&quot;  This referenced investment is not only financial but emotional and not only affects the &quot;composer&quot; but the composer&#039;s spouse and children.  The answer has a lot to do with how charmed a life you&#039;ve lived until now?
The truth is that you cannot work hard enough to secure your success.  You cannot be talented enough to secure your success.  If your life is configured so that you can live on very little and not negatively impact those you love, go for it.  Give yourself a period of time to become self-supportive.  If, after that time has elapsed, you are still not able to make a decent living, turn to plan &quot;B&quot;.  Oh, did I forget to mention that you should HAVE a plan &quot;B&quot;?
Do not mortgage your house.  Do not buy more gear thinking that &quot;If I only had Hollywood Strings.....&quot;  There may be times ahead in which this profession will once agin be healthy.  We, who work in this field, can and should make every effort to &quot;re-sophisticate&quot; our profession but, at the moment, like the stock market, don&#039;t be, in poker terms, &quot;all in&quot;.  Odds are odds.  And frankly, they&#039;re currently in favor of the house. </description>
