					<description><![CDATA[most of us are especially asked to sound like someone else. in commercial spots and movies there is temp music you have to copy at least soundwise.

there are styles of music which live from new sounds. electronic music can&#039;t be done with presets, the sound itself is the message.

and there is the music made of melodies, harmonies, arrangement and orchestration. it&#039;s a world of using instruments as voices in a choir. just get the best voices.

and there is your &#039;own&#039; music, created as a platform to express yourself. you shouldn&#039;t do this with presets, not even wih virtual instruments at all exept as a background for your played instrument or voice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great thought starter!  I think there are two ways to look at it, from our perspective as media composers:

1. Artistically
It should matter.  We should be creating unique work that has integrity.  We should strive to find and develop our voice.  The process and materials are as important to the final product as the composition itself.
OR
It doesn&#039;t matter - you have other priorities, focus.  The factory patch works perfectly, why mess about?  For that matter, how tired is the use of orchestra in film music?  Is that a cliche &quot;patch&quot;?

2. Business-wise
It doesn&#039;t matter. We are paid to deliver a musically based product.  As long as it sounds good and works to picture and pleases the client, that&#039;s all that matters.
OR
It does matter, because you are creating a signature, and part of what you are selling is tied in to your unique personal brand.  Your process is part of your appeal as a professional.  I think this is actually the most salient point here - a way to add value to your projects and your business.

Coincidentally, a project a friend and I are working on right now is a new sound library (with a twist!  on the rocks...) yes, time consuming and arduous, but an incredible learning experience, and something which I think will add tremendous value for us down the road.  If you&#039;re interested, I posted some photos and a description of one of our adventures breaking into an abandoned factory :)  FUN! http://adrianelliscomposer.com/AdriansBlog/2010/11/16/adventures-in-field-recording/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[With deadlines being tight and schedule changes I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a problem with using already made sounds. With that said though, I think it always works to the composer&#039;s advantage to take a preset and tweak it into something more interesting.
I think Omnisphere is one of the best sound design programs out there because there is just so much that you can do with it. I always favorite the presets that I like and slowly tweak them to make them more of my own. After a couple of months, I ended up having a library full of great sounds that I can always use.
I think a lot of the Stylus RMX patches have been over used now. I was listening to the a track from District 9 the other day and I was amazed at how much stylus is used in that particular score. Check out the track &#039;Harvesting Material&#039; and then listen to the Perc 1 from the Find The Exit patch in Stylus RMX.  Sound familiar ;) I don&#039;t think that&#039;s a bad thing, but it seems to be done more and more these days. 
Great article!]]></description>
