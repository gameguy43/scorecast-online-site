You probably have heard of a few models from Mackie including the Mackie Control, and the HUI. <a href=\"http:\/\/presonus.com\/\">Presonus <\/a>and <a href=\"http:\/\/frontierdesign.com\/\">Frontier Design<\/a> have entered the market with a single fader unit, and if you\u2019re Houston Haynes you already use the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.smartav.net\/tango\/index.php\">SmartAV Tango<\/a> controller. <a href=\"http:\/\/euphonix.com\/\">Euphonix<\/a> has also come out with two lower cost versions of their higher-end controllers, the System 5 and MC Pro. These lower cost versions, the MC Mix and MC Control offer a great deal of features for the price.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">DAW controllers have been around for a few years now, but have increased in visibility more and more in project studios and composing rigs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So, what <em>is<\/em> a DAW Remote Controller? As we started mixing more in the box, the desire to have more analog style faders to mix increased. Using a mouse became a pain for people used to using a real mixing console. Being able to mix via larger sized faders versus using the mouse became a necessity. Also the ability to control the transport functions (start, stop, record) and even control and automate parameters of plugins, enables you to improve your workflow. With that in mind, manufactures started producing these remote controllers that look like some kind of audio mixer but does not pass any audio. They offer various controls for your DAW parameters and transport functions giving you the simplicity of mixing in the box, the control of a stand-alone <a class=\"zem_slink freebase\/guid\/9202a8c04000641f800000000015377a\" title=\"Mixing console\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mixing_console\" rel=\"wikipedia\">mixing board<\/a>, and the flexibility of the computer.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These controllers use various protocols to communicate. Mackie Control and HUI are the most common, as well as proprietary protocols such as Euphonix\u2019s Eucon. These run over <a class=\"zem_slink freebase\/guid\/9202a8c04000641f80000000000282fe\" title=\"Musical Instrument Digital Interface\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Musical_Instrument_Digital_Interface\" rel=\"wikipedia\">MIDI<\/a>, <a class=\"zem_slink freebase\/guid\/9202a8c04000641f800000000003ed6d\" title=\"Universal Serial Bus\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Universal_Serial_Bus\" rel=\"wikipedia\">USB<\/a> and <a class=\"zem_slink freebase\/guid\/9202a8c04000641f80000000000149d0\" title=\"Ethernet\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ethernet\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Ethernet<\/a>. Some controllers come in a single fader package and most others offer 4-8 channels. Most of the manufactures allow you to expand your control surface by connecting more of these fader units together, building larger 24 channel units.<\/p>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><a style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/23755444@N00\/2501620949\"><img style=\"display: block; height: 240px; width: 204px;\" alt=\"Apogee with Euphonix control surface\" src=\"http:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3124\/2501620949_e919c2456f_m.jpg\" \/><\/a>I just recently in the last two months have started using both of the Euphonix models, the MC Control and the MC Mix, together in my studio. I love these things! Aside from having nice big faders to <a class=\"zem_slink freebase\/guid\/9202a8c04000641f800000000ad32db3\" title=\"Audio mixing (recorded music)\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Audio_mixing_%28recorded_music%29\" rel=\"wikipedia\">mix<\/a> with, I love the control and flexibility these units bring me in my workflow. Now, I have used other controllers in the past, so I am familiar with the overall effectiveness of having one to work with, but let me tell you a few things about these Euphonix models.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Euphonix artist series has two models: the MC control, which is a motorized 4-fader touch sensitive model with a wonderful touch screen, and the MC Mix which features a motorized 8-channel touch sensitive unit without the touch screen. Both of these units use the Eucon protocol.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Eucon is a high-speed bi-directional Ethernet protocol. You hook these units up via Ethernet directly to your computers Ethernet port(s) or via an Ethernet switch. Speeds up to gigabit are supported. The Eucon protocol is 250 times faster than MIDI. Anybody who has experienced the dreadful MIDI logjam (when MIDI notes can\u2019t be processed fast enough and they end up being fired almost like a machine gun after a period of delay) can testify that having a faster protocol to send data is a big plus. Eucon also offers 1024 steps of resolution versus MIDI\u2019s 128 steps. This gives you more control of your fades with less zipper noise.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Euphonix MC Control has a wonderful color touch screen and has 12 configurable soft keys that can be configured to use not only specific DAW functions, but also standard file-new, open, and save type commands. They also have bank buttons that let you skip faders in groups of 8. The MC Control also has 8 touch sensitive rotary encoders that can be assigned to control plugin parameters, panning, etc. The MC Mix has in addition to the 8 faders, 8 rotary encoders and 8 displays for surround metering, track names and panning.<\/p>\n<p>The Euphonix system lets you expand up to 36 faders for the ultimate DAW mixing system.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Since the MC\u2019s support the Mackie Control protocol, HUI as well as Eucon, they can virtually control any application that supports one of these protocols. These controllers work on both the Mac and the PC.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So as I mentioned, I have been using these controllers in my studio with both DP and Logic Studio 8 and recently Logic Studio 9, as Logic and DP both support the native Eucon protocol. After adding the controller, the DAW recognizes the MC and automatically maps your channels to the faders in the current session that\u2019s loaded.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">My productivity has increased greatly using these controllers. Having the ability to get to certain large groups of channels quickly, and having transport jog and shuttle controls are nice features. Being able to shuttle audio and MIDI back and forth for precise edits really helps. I use the soft keys to add new audio, MIDI and instrument tracks, and the faders are really nice. Having touch sensitivity allows me when working in Logic, to simply touch a fader and the corresponding Logic track gets selected.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For me, using the faders for gain riding my mixes is much easy and fulfilling than drawing it in with a mouse. I do use a mouse for very precise editing, but 90% of the time I am using the faders. I don\u2019t know if I can put a quantitative number to the time I save using these controllers, but I feel myself working much faster. Maybe its just me, but something about having theses controllers in front of me makes me smile. Probably similar to the notion of making your work space an inviting and creative experience. When I sit down to work and these faders start flying around, I get to feel like I\u2019m on the Big SSL 4K, which I have always dreamed of working on. LOL \u2026\u2026I know I am a total techno geek.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I highly recommend anyone not using a DAW controller to look seriously into getting one. It will greatly improve your workflow and give you the flexibility and control of mixing using large touch sensitive faders.
