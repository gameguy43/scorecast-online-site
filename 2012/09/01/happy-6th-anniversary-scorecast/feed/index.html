		<description>Thanks so much, Terry! I am personally thrilled that you are such a huge part of this and I know that the leadership team appreciates all that you do and participate in as well. Many more ahead of us, bro! Thanks again! :)</description>

		<description>Well, I&#039;ve only been a part of the SCOREcast community for about a year now, but what a year that has been! I&#039;ve gone from someone with a dream but hardly a damn clue of what to do about it to someone who&#039;s about to officially start his own music company!


It&#039;s fair to say I wouldn&#039;t have arrived at the place I am right now if it wasn&#039;t for the wonderful advice and support I&#039;ve had from you guys, and the amazingly helpful articles that you have published on this very website. I&#039;d like to give a special shout-out to the crew at SCOREcast: London on Facebook, I can&#039;t imagine my day going by now without their help, advice and general camaraderie... cheers guys!


So once again, happy 6th birthday SCOREcast and long may it continue! :)</description>
