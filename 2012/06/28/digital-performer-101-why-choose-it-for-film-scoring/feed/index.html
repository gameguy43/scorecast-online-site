					<description><![CDATA[Again John, thank you for information on DP.  I have pro tools 8 LE and I got it because I wanted Sibelius because the same company uses them (AVID).  I want to know does PT do the same as DP with film scoring or is one easier than the other.  Also does DP support Sibelius on its platform?  It seems I see you are speaking strictly film music.  Can DP be used for composing in other forms of music, like hip hop, jazz arranging, etc? I&#039;m asking because I want to upgrade to pro tools 10, but I really need to have a little feedback on what I&#039;m asking.  Thank you very much.,,Kenny]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You really hit its with the arguments of the &#034;best&#034; or the &#034;worst&#034; and all I want is something to help me create music and help me work better  I hard about though DP 8 and after reading your info of it, I might even try it. It seems everyone has something to say about something, but at the moment of choice, it&#039;s only you to decide.  Thank you for your acknowledgment about DP 8.  I like it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John great article.  And so true.  I&#039;ve been in Pro Tools land for the past 8 months but I recently went back to DP and gosh, no crashes.  What a novelty.  If MOTU ever decides to release DP8, I think I will be firmly planted back in their camp for most of my non concert related pieces.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[















Hi John. 


 


Thank you for the great article. I have dabbled with DP a
few times now, and each time I am nearer to changing for good. The new 64 bit
version will definitely help. 


 My one “would like” is full elastic audio like Logic and
Cubase. I use it in Logic from time to time, and would miss it. 


 The “several chunks in one file” idea is brilliant. I can
really see that speeding up work on multiple (but similar) cues. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi John, thanks for the nice introduction to DP. I always felt that DP is probably one of the best DAWs to work for picture if not the best. The only reason that would make me change (from Pro tools &#038; Logic) was if Apple drop it (Logic), it happen me once when Gibson bough Studio Vision Pro and bag it. Anyway, having another working tool that works for me, won&#039;t stop me to appreciate  DP evolution closely and congrat those who have it! I&#039;ll be happy to follow your future DP articles! Peace, Jorge Costa]]></description>
