Even though it's the fourth largest city in England, few people have heard of Sheffield, my base in the UK.

The first time I pitched for a gig, it was an unpaid feature. I was fresh out of postgrad college and needed to get a credit and some showreel fodder urgently. I beat 40 other composers, wuh yeah! … but I think I had an unfair advantage at that level, and it was pretty much a done deal that I'd win. It was unpaid, and a student film too. I figured after the fact that not many composers with my experience, training and skill would probably go for a gig like that.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMoral of the tale - shoot low.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMy god, that's awful advice, that can't be right.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ePerhaps rather it should be… be better than the competition! But what does 'better' mean. Let us know your thoughts in the Comments below.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe second time I pitched, I didn't get the gig. There were two other composers in the running, and the best man won, to be fair. The pitch was very specific and precise, and I twisted it a little to suit my style, skills and gear. I had a few redrafts too after feedback, which meant I got closer to the desired product, a luxury not usually afforded to pitching composers. I think I was treated better since I'd worked with the director before and he was in my corner! \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWhen I heard the music on the show though, I realised why I didn't get the gig.

Oops.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAt the time, I was pretty gutted - I'd assumed that since they'd come to me first and that the director wanted to work with me again that it was a done deal. \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eTrust me, it's \u003ci\u003enever\u003c/i\u003e a done deal 'til the fat lady sings.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMorals of the tale: \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf the client has been very specific, really do follow that brief, to the letter.

He's not the only one who has the final say…\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDon't take it personally. Rejection is par for the course in this line of work. It's not personal, it's not that you're a bad person, it's (hopefully) not that your music is dire. It just wasn't right, and someone else got closer to that bullseye. Find out what the finished music was like, learn what it was that they meant by their brief, get over it and move on to the next job. :-)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe third time I pitched, I have to be honest… my heart wasn't really in it. It was not a passion project, but rather a friend's film, co-produced with a big-name channel, destined for broadcast - and so had the promise of back-end royalties. My heart became less in it when I got 3 very different briefs over the course of 6 weeks with various revisions going back and forth. By the end, I was still putting in the effort, but the love for the work had gone. Ugh.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCan you guess whether I got the gig?

Surprisingly (or not), no, partly because by this point I had developed that elephant-thick skin that is so important when dealing with criticism and/or rejection. But partly I was also a little relieved. The brief was really tricky to pin down and changed with every new conversation I had… and I took that as a sign of things to come. Also the tracks I wrote were awesome and I'm now selling them as library tracks. Win-win. :-)\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMoral of the tale: \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhen pitching, if the brief is hazy, ill-defined or keeps changing, you better develop some awesome mind-reading skills. Otherwise you have to rely on the gamble of guessing and hoping. This isn't to say that you should avoid these gigs if they're the only ones available to you at the time. You may get lucky. Just don't get too attached to the outcome.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf a brief keeps changing as you pitch, it doesn't bode well for the rest of the gig even if you do somehow win the commission.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf it's not a passion project, or even a subject matter that interests you vaguely, the other benefits better be good. 'Cos if they're not… why are you pitching for it in the first place? There has to be some inspiration for those lines and dots, you know.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe music you wrote should be pretty awesome if you put your all into it. It still belongs to you. Why not flog it through a music library, or offer it to your local filmmaking buddies for non-exclusive licensing, if it's appropriate for that sort of project. Sell it on iTunes. Don't let it just sit there, put it to work.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eNow, as I write this I'm pitching again. I actually just finished uploading the tracks to the ftp!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eYikes.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis time the brief is pretty, well, brief. And not really a brief, more a transcription/reduction of an email conversation between the production company and the funding clients, where they decide that they'd like to compare different styles for the work rather than being very specific. It's really very open-ended. But there are some 'style' tracks that the clients appear to like and also a sample of the video to work to, which gives an idea of where they're headed. And the genre of the project is sooooo in an area that I really want to get into, so the love is there. \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo this one is a little bit of an experiment. I'm sticking to the 'vibe' of the style tracks, but they're definitely in my 'niche' writing style too. I'm providing lots of variety within those styles, some very contemporary, some more orchestral and cinematic and also there'll be tracks that blend the two styles.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf I get the gig, I want to be writing music that I want to write, that I love to write, that will make me jump out of bed in the morning in the knowledge that I'm scoring a series I'm excited about.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf I'm not the right gal for the gig with these tracks, I won't be gutted that I didn't get the job.

Most things that are worth doing don't come easy. However, there are many tried and true methods as well as some proven principles that most of us here at SCO can safely say we've built our working careers on.
