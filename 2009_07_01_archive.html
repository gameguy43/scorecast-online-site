To round out our month on workflow, consider the following provocation:<br />
<div><b>Composers should waste as much time as possible each day.</b><br />
<br />
As with most of these Weekend Provocations, this isn't meant to be taken at face value&#8212;but there <i>is</i> value, I think, in stepping outside of conventional wisdom and considering things from a different perspective (even if that perspective is just plain nuts).<br />
<br />
Could this be interpreted in some way that makes sense? Even if not, what does it suggest to you? What, exactly, constitutes "wasting time"? Can writing music be a waste of time? Is the "each day" part of that sentence as important as the "wasting time" part? &#8212;and on and on like that.<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think.</div></div>

What ever can go wrong WILL go wrong, and usually at the most inopportune time, which can almost always be a real workflow killer.<br />
<br />
We as composers and musicians plan out every note, every scene, the subtleties, grand orchestrations, and movements, then something beyond our control takes the reins and all of our beautiful planning is for naught. Now what?<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><br />
Take, for instance, the last couple months of my life. I was lucky enough to find the love of my life and get married. We are expecting our son in about two weeks. My wife is a costume designer and artist too, so we were both already on top of a heap of projects just to get us through and keep life hitting on all eight. Throw into that a wedding, a new child, my two year old daughter, and the other projects we both have going on and it made for a filled-to-the-brim schedule. But it was okay... I had every minute planned... where I was going to be, what music I was going to write, what I was working on... then BAMM! My closest Uncle passed away.<br />
<br />
This should have been the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. But instead, this is where the extra planning and &#8220;Go with the flow&#8221; attitude became a saving grace.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;">Living in <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee" rel="wikipedia" title="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>, my momentum as a film composer recently has slowed a little more than I would like. As one of SCOREcast's "outside the Beltway" guys, business is good. Lately, however, I've had some pretty dramatic ups and downs, both from the demand being slow right now and also from things in "real" life that have collided with others to take me for an unexpected ride.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;">The lessons here are two-fold: I've learned that being prepared for the down time is crucial. When business slows up or you get a call from the producers and everything is suddenly in a holding pattern, what do you do? What do you have in place as a plan to get you through the unexpected drop outs and slow downs?&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;">Secondly, have you developed a "go with the flow" attitude and how do you work with the unplanned aspects of life? Some things in the first lesson really help out in the second, so let's explore them individually and see what we can learn.<br />
<br />
<b>Part I: Keep Going!</b><br />
So, that project you were counting on to carry you through the summer is no longer a reality, and there isn&#8217;t another one lying at your door. Is it time to stop the presses, hunker down, and ride out the storm? NO! Keep going.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;">You have to keep yourself busy. If you find yourself with no project, create one for yourself. Write down a list of emotions, moods or feelings. Pick one, any one, throw a dart at the list, and write a piece of music about it. Go through your DVD collection and pick a movie &#8212; one of your favorites &#8212; turn the sound off and start scoring. Give the film a whole new feel. Pick a style of music that is outside your comfort zone... polka, electronica, country, whatever &#8212; something that's not your strong suit &#8212; and write a cue in that style. It is about keeping your creativity going and always pressing your limits to expand your talent and become a better composer. Use the down time to your advantage.<br />
</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;">Uninspired musically? How about some of the menial tasks of career management? You can't just sit around in your studio ALL the time, no matter how much you may want to. Jobs won&#8217;t come to you, unless you are really lucky. You have to network, and you also have to make sure you are ready for the possible influx of work. Have demo discs ready. Hop online, check the paper, go to the local university music and film dept. Meet people, you never know who will be where you are at any given moment. Go to film openings, local indie events. Get your name and your music out there. Someone needs it... your job is to find <i>them</i>.<br />
<br />
<b>Part II: Be Prepared</b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: small;">Be ready for those things that are planned and those that are not. Change is the only constant. By pushing yourself and creating your own projects you will end up with a more diverse catalog and a larger library to fall back on if you ever find your self in need of music with no time to create it.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;">Things will change and that's alright. I was working on a full length feature film and things were going great. Seemingly out of nowhere, it all came unraveled as the time came for me to put the finishing touches on the score. Months of time were lost and gobs of money was flushed away due to circumstances with the production that were comepletely beyond of my control.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;">Out of that experience, I somehow found myself in a conversation with none other than Mr. Deane Ogden about my dillemma. Continued conversations that started with questions and griping about that horrible experience lead to me sitting in on the first roundtable for the SCOREcast podcast, and then to becoming a regular contributor to the SCOREcast website.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;">So, my advice? Take it all in stride. Sometimes what seems to be the biggest loss is the start of an even greater possibility.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;">I look forward to your comments and continued dialogue on this. Tell me what you think you are doing right now to plan for the worst. Are you ready for the storms? Even more importantly, are you ready for your own success?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;">Let's hash it out in the COMMENTS below!<br />

There's nothing for a while, then three projects come along at once.<br />
<br />
In the last six months I have been inundated with composing and sound design work for film and theatre and I am constantly thanking my lucky stars. This is exactly what I wanted when I started out many years ago.<br />
<br />
Isn't it?<br />
<br />
<div style="float: right; margin: auto 0px 30px 30px;"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5360077328352690530" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R_A7kO7XEmo/SmLR7mUWQWI/AAAAAAAAACA/02xwteqKs4Y/s320/graphicscore.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 0pt 10px 30px 0pt;" /><br />
<div margin="auto auto 30px auto;" style="text-align: center;">Stay sane in the midst of chaos!</div></div>Just kidding - of course it is, but on a day-to-day basis it can be a little bit of a challenge to keep the many, many minutes of music flowing, pouring out your heart and soul on demand, whilst maintaining a vague level of sanity.<br />
<br />
It's really, truly and utterly important not to take on too much work. The amount that will make all of your creative efforts suffer and, inevitably, life miserable (plus you'll likely get a rep and your success'll be pretty short-lived).<br />
<br />
But short of that, I've never turned composing work down that I honestly believe I have the time and the skills to work on. This strategy hasn't failed me yet ;-)<br />
<br />
<h2>Variety</h2><br />
The variety of having multiple composing projects on the go is fantastic, and I really do enjoy it. In a way, having several very different works in progress keeps the interest going and staves off staleness. If you do hit a brick wall and are seriously not in the right mindset for one project there's always the option of switching around your schedule to work on another.<br />
<br />
<h2>Figure out how best you work...</h2><br />
If you're built this way, you can always 'flit' between tasks, as suggested as a way of working in <a href="2009/01/lee-sanders.html" target="_blank">Lee Sanders'</a> post <a href="2009/04/so-im-trying-out-this-blog-for-very.html" target="_blank">'To Flit or Not to Flit'</a>.<br />
<br />
However, I'm a lot more like <a href="2009/05/joe-trapanese.html" target="_blank"> Joe Trapenese</a> in his comment below the aforementioned post - <span style="font-style: italic;">compartmentalized.</span> I'm a firm believer that, once the task for the day has been chosen, then being completely immersed in that project and that project alone gets the best music out there.<br />
<br />
Getting the music out there on time, to schedule, up to standard, requires focus. 100% concentration on the project at hand. I've found that, without that focus, the work suffers. Turn twitter and email off. If you really need to churn out the notes, turn off your mobile phone (sorry, US readers, cellphone!). Ignore the landline phone, turn off the ringer if you can. Stick a note on your door, 'no interruptions on pain of death!' And so on, and so on.<br />
<br />
<h2>Organize Your Time</h2><br />
Be ruthlessly organized. Take a little time to plot your schedule realistically. Because I know I work compartmentally, I group specific projects into days, or better still into weeks.<br />
<br />
What time of day are you most productive? Are you an <a href="http://www.heather-fenoughty.com/blog/2009/03/20/early-bird-or-night-owl" target="_blank">early bird or a night owl</a>? Schedule your creative and admin tasks accordingly.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Prioritize</span><br />
What tasks have you to do that are important (seriously, though, what's more important than writing music? ok, ok, family, exercise, blah blah blah ;-) )? What's urgent? What's neither (then why is it on the list? Come on, you gotta write five minutes of music today!)?<br />
<br />
<a href="http://onstartups.com/home/tabid/3339/bid/8853/Startup-Conversations-With-Myself-What-Should-I-Work-On.aspx" target="_blank">Here's a useful post by a chap who's struggling with prioritising his tasks</a>. Though it's geared towards more general Startup Entrepeneur types, there's a lot of relevant points for us busy composers.<br />
<br />
You can be seriously anal with this sort of organization if that floats your boat. Back in uni, one of my lecturers recommended that you decide specifically which cues you'll compose on which day during your schedule right after the spotting session. You work on that cue on that day until it's finished, no matter how long it takes. Conversely, as a reward for finishing a cue earlier than expected, instead of carrying on with the next scheduled cue early, stop work for the day.<br />
<br />
Personally, I like to set myself a specific duration of music which has to be written by the end of the working day rather than specific cues. Which allows me the freedom to do a sort of flitting, I suppose, between similar cues, without being completely restricted.<br />
<br />
<h2>Task switching</h2><br />
One thing I've discovered is that it's really tricky to switch between composing projects quickly during the same day. Mike Carey, fabulous novel and comic author of various titles for Hellblazer amongst others says that, ideally, sticking to one project-per-day is the ideal formula, and from experience this year I would have to agree. <a href="http://mikeandpeter.com/2009/07/a-whole-lot-of-marvel-stuff%E2%80%A6/comment-page-1/#comment-189" target="_blank">Read his comment here.</a><br />
<br />
While it takes maybe 15 minutes or so to get into that 'flow' state of pure concentration when starting the first composing task of the day, it can take anywhere up to an hour or more to get my head into gear if I have to switch between projects during that same day; the tunes in my head are still from the first project. And that's a couple of hours we can ill-afford to waste if there's a way around it, by careful planning and blocking of time to ensure the project-per-day rule.<br />
<br />
<h2>'Gateway' Activity</h2><br />
But if you're really stuffed for time, Mike Carey suggests creating an intentional 'gateway' activity to switch between projects: re-reading (or listening) to previous completed project-specific work, listening to a piece of music that puts you in the right moodstate, that sort of thing.<br />
<br />
Heck - go for a walk or take a nap and really delineate the time between the two projects definitively. This is great, practical, common-sense stuff that really does work.<br />
<br />
I've recently found leaving a cue deliberately half-finished for the next time I start to work on that project is rather a sneaky way of getting the brain into gear without having to start from that initially difficult 'blank-page' scenario. I'll write a note in a marker on the timeline to myself - 'fix timing here', 'check instrumentation', etc. Because that cue appeared to take less time to write than it would have if it had been started from scratch in one sitting, it'll have a positive feedback affect and seems to create momentum to push me into the next cue a little bit more easily than had I not gone through this process.<br />
<br />
<h2>Get a Head Start</h2><br />
As much as possible, be involved in the project as early as possible.<br />
<br />
This is easier said than done as often, as composers, we have no say in how late in the day we're approached to work on a film or other media project. I'm a firm believer that the subconscious is a much more useful creativity tool than it's given credit for, and that the longer I can give it the task to come up with themes and sounds and palettes and tones for a given project the better, without necessarily actually writing a note until final cut.<br />
<br />
Which segues nicely onto a sticky subject... composing to picture before it is locked off.<br />
<br />
Love it or hate it, this is generally the reality now: a necessity in these days of dwindling time-scales for post-production sound. All I can say is that, whilst this is a less than ideal scenario, it's something to accept, to get used to and try to work to your advantage.<br />
<br />
Keep the cues as fluid as possible, simplify your orchestration so that you can keep all the cues in one arrangement file for as long as possible before the computer starts to grind to a halt, and you have to save cues to separate files, and keep in touch with the editor and director to see which edits are likely to remain into the locked cut.<br />
<br />
<h2>Delegate</h2><br />
Spread the love! Dish out the lower-level tasks such as basic sound design, recording (even the cleaning) etc., to someone that costs less for you to pay in terms of money than it would cost for you in time. <a href="2009/07/you-need-help-or-do-you-part-i.html" style="font-weight: normal;" target="_blank">Deane Ogden's post here</a> gives way more useful information on this than ever I could!<br />
<br />
<h2>In Conclusion...</h2><br />
I realise that getting the work through the door is often a tricky enough prospect without worrying about how to juggle several projects at once. However, once you're in that situation it'll be very useful to have a couple of strategies in place to stay in control... and still enjoy the process!<br />
<br />
And don't forget to turn your phone, email and Tweetdeck back on when your done. There may be another project lined up just waiting for you to accept it ;-)</div>

<div>Just a quick question for the thousands of lovely SCOREcast readers out there:</div><div></div><div><b>What's your batting average? </b></div><div></div><div>Or, rather, how many minutes of finished music can you crank out in a day? </div><div></div><div><i>Note: for 'crank out', read: craft, create, splurge, sketch, mix, master, etc. - I'm being deliberately vague here to leave the forum open ;-)</i></div><div></div><div>It's important for planning your workflow and schedule to know what your average is. I read in the comments (really sorry, can't find it for the moment!) for one of the recent posts here on SCOREcast that one chap knows what his music-making output is <i>per hour</i> - that's super-aware!</div><div></div><div>I know for a fact that I make more usable music in the earlier hours of the day, and that later hours are best used for more low-level tasks, admin etc, so this hourly rate varies so much to not be a useful tool for me... but is it for you?</div><div></div><div>Also, on longer projects (as Deane et al have already stated) as the musical themes and flavour get under your skin, writing gets faster towards the end of the project. This is useful to know if only for your sanity at the start of the project when you're looking at a blank sequence!</div><div></div><div>But, on the whole, knowing your daily <i>average</i> is most useful, I find. I know that on one day I may only make 2 minutes of decent score and the rest is waffle, but on another day there may be a new 10-minutes-worth of glorious musical loveliness, mixed and mastered, perfectly synced to score (though, trust me, this is more rare ;-) ). I can't predict from one day to the next which it'll be, but I do know that over a period of time, say, a month, it'll be clearer what the per-day average is, and I can use that to plan the next project.</div><div></div><div>I used to average about a minute (if I'm completely honest, that was on a good day, if you know what I mean) when I first started out many years ago. Now it's up to about 5 minutes or so.</div><div></div><div>So, let me know: what's <i><b>your</b></i> batting average?</div><div></div></div>

<div id='summary324402677083044788'><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm-CEiV9hxI/AAAAAAAAAek/nmsYPs9SJ-g/s1600-h/sig-ogden.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm-CEiV9hxI/AAAAAAAAAek/nmsYPs9SJ-g/s320/sig-ogden.png" /></a></div>This one is just off the top of my head, but the immediacy of the lesson for me warrants a "butt-in" on the regular traffic here at SCOREcast.<br />
<br />
I am attending a film festival this week in LA to promote a film that I recently scored called "In the Eyes of a Killer" with my director <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0541909/" rel="imdb" title="Louis Mandylor">Louis Mandylor</a>. I have met a grip of great people at this fest and have seen many great films, all by talented filmmakers that at one time or another... needed film composers!! (Hint hint, nudge nudge, wink wink... Get out there and network!!)<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SnAE8tPWRzI/AAAAAAAAAes/rMGGjzAAj8Y/s1600-h/photo.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SnAE8tPWRzI/AAAAAAAAAes/rMGGjzAAj8Y/s320/photo.jpg" /></a></div>In a conversation with a group of directors and producers yesterday, the talk turned to <i>producing movies</i>. One of them said, "Deane, why don't you produce in addition to compose? You are a such a good producer... you should just do it as another career."<br />
<br />
I fumbled through some sort of answer like, "Aw shucks, guys... I just cannot think of anything I'd rather do than compose." With a little more chiding and a little more dodging from me, they were finally satisfied and we changed the topic.<br />
<br />
The more I thought about it throughout the day, however, the more that situation showed its true colors as a glaring example of what my dad often refers to as "good being the enemy of great". <br />
<br />
The truth is, I <b><i>am</i></b> a good producer. I have an incredibly solid sense of film and I know how to tell a story, and tell it well. I've been offered producer credits several times on films that I've been hired to score simply because I've talked directors, editors, and producers into doing things that they never would have done had someone like me not pitched them on it. But in the end, producing neither interests me or is what I am 100% passionate about. I am passionate about one thing, and one thing only: Scoring the film.<br />
<br />
Here is the lesson in this for me: <i>Being "good" at something doesn't necessarily mean you should do it.</i> I'm a decent orchestrator, but I would much rather hire people like Brian Satterwhite or Susie Benchasil that are "great" at it. I can sit down and copy parts for the orchestra, but my attention to detail in that department is not anywhere in the same ball-park as someone like Steven Julliani's. I'm also quite handy with a hammer and can keep a poker face like nobody's business, but I'm not a housing contractor or a world-championship card shark, either!<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I feel like since I am a solid businessman (which is what it takes to be a killer producer), I'd almost be playing it <i>safe</i> if I was to choose that career over this one. The honest truth is that when you are passionate about something, you are willing to risk it all to make it happen, and I'm not passionate about <i>producing</i>. Therefore, it would be a "sleepwalking" job for me that I know I wouldn't throw my heart and soul into on a daily basis. I would be one of those cautionary tales you here about at cocktail parties where "Yeah, Deane is a great producer, but man... the lights are on but there's nobody home anymore." Not good.<br />
<br />
Yet, I see it all the time... people in careers that are unfulfilling to them, and when called on the carpet for it, the answer is one that most often has to do with <i>security</i> and <i>safety</i>. The problem is that nobody gets anywhere by playing it safe.<br />
<br />
"Good" is safe, but "great" is fulfilling. I left a very financially safe career playing drums in the pop music world to do what I've always wanted to do. Now I have a great life that I wouldn't trade for anything, and I've often said that I'd rather be homeless and living in a box if I still got to score films than be rich beyond belief in a job doing anything but.<br />
<br />
So the challenge is this: If you <i>aren't</i> doing what you are passionate about... why not? What's the matter? Maybe it's what people have told you you're good at. Have you ever thought about that? People always seem to know what <i>you</i> should be doing with <i>yourself</i>. I hate that. It's like "Live your own life and let me do <i>my</i> thing, will ya!" If you listen to what people say you ought to be when you grow up, then guess what? You'll be old and fat and have a nice house and drive a nice car but still be miserable as hell. Any questions?<br />
<br />
Maybe you are <i>afraid</i> of something. Are you <i>scared</i> that things might not be the way they are now... all nice and safe and secure... if you were to begin doing what you were made to do? It's okay if you are... we have all been afraid at some point. That is a natural human response to a very realistic dilemma, and nobody can or should fault you for it. But, you have to move past it and you have to overcome that fear, otherwise it will keep you from doing what truly brings you the most joy in your life.<br />
<br />
Now, go write some kick-ass music for something... you know... the kind only <b><i>you</i></b> can write!<br />
<br />

I'd like to get a peek at what one of these roadmaps looks like (even if it's just scribbles and random notes). Being the "planner" I am, I'm already thinking of some sort of template. Maybe something that takes you progressively from random notes to roadmap to spotting to cue sheet.... Does anything like that already exist?</span></blockquote></blockquote><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">This is a great question, and one that could be met with as many different answers as there are composers that exercise this practice. In this post, I'm going to show you a handful of the things that I do in my work that help me achieve a cohesive plan when taking on a new set of visuals to score. Before I do that, though, let's define a set of assumed parameters so that we can make sure we are all on the same page.</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">I'm assuming that:</span></div><ol style="font-family: inherit;"><li><span style="font-size: small;"><b>You are *not* working with a <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_editor_%28filmmaking%29" rel="wikipedia" title="Music editor (filmmaking)">music editor</a>.</b> A music editor, according to <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Karlin" rel="wikipedia" title="Fred Karlin">Fred Karlin</a>,&nbsp; is the "person responsible for all physical details regarding the syncronization of the score with the picture." In short, this person is usually involved from the outset of post-production and may be intimately involved with placing temp music into the film, recording and notating the spotting notes at a spotting session between you and the director, and finally, placing and syncronizing the recorded, mixed, and finalized score stems into the film itself for dubbing. Many of the duties handled by an independent film composer (one who is essentially doing it *all* on his/her own) would otherwise be handled by the music supervisor, thus taking some of the load off the shoulders of the composer and allowing him/her to focus solely on writing and recording the score.<br />
<br />
</span>  </li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;"><b>You don't have a ton of time to write the score.</b> It's becoming pretty typical with any film, but almost certainly with an independent film, we as composers do not have a lot of time to do our jobs when the locked cut is finally handed over. There have even been times for me when I was already on the scoring stage on an indie film and here comes Mr. Director with a new cut that nobody but him and the editor knew about until... now. <br />
<br />
</span>  </li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;"><b>You don't have a ton of money in the music budget.</b> Duh! Helllooooo! Money in the post-production budget for music on an independent film? What in the hell is that?<br />
<br />
</span>  </li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;"><b>You have adequately immersed yourself in the material.</b> As a competent composer, you have to develop the discipline of <i>getting under</i> the material so that you have a solid understanding of the story's arc at a core level. Try for a second to understand the difference between "scoring <i>through</i> a film" versus simply "scoring a film". There is a huge difference, and a lot of the difference comes from your ability to get the material into your headspace either through the script, the concept drawings or storyboards, or the locked cut. Bottom line: You must have enough of a love of the characters in your story to warrant you being trusted with them for this period of time. If you don't care, your music will tattle on you &#8212; I promise!<br />
</span> </li>
</ol><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">So, assuming all of those &#8212; or at least one or two of them &#8212; are in place, here are some things I do when I am roadmapping a score to insure that I don't get too far ahead of myself before realizing that I should have taken "that left toyn at Albuquerque."</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>ORGANIZE YOUR LOGISTICS</b><br />
Let's first define what we are hired to do: <b><i>Write music</i></b>. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. We are the music people. However, we all know that there are way more things involved in scoring for a feature than just simply writing the music, don't we? There are probably hundreds of little tiny nagging tasks that must be done daily in our studios in order than we might concentrate fully on writing score. I'm talking about phone calls, emails, notes, mailings, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol" rel="wikipedia" title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</a> deliveries, invoicing, etc. Those all fall into what I would consider only one single set of administrative duties.</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">The other set consists of things that are directly related to the main task of writing the music: Spotting the film; organizing spotting notes; keeping track of reel splits; scheduling live sessions; notating edit changes; interfacing with music editors, recording engineers, and mixers; and, last but certainly not least, keeping track of how much music you have left to write and how much time you have to write it in.</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><i><b>Cue Log Manager and Cue Chronicle</b></i><br />
Luckily, there are a couple of killer software programs that can handle that entire last paragraph for you. The first one is a little number called <i><b>Cue Log Manager (CLM)</b></i>. CLM is a <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileMaker" rel="wikipedia" title="FileMaker">Filemaker Pro</a> database application that allows you to keep track of a film score, television score, or game score project from spotting to delivery. It was developed by Dino Herrmann and Daniel Hamuy, the team behind the popular "Powerkeys" DAW add-on.</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: inherit; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm12M4soB1I/AAAAAAAAAeE/NTPT2blbtBA/s1600-h/Picture+17.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm12M4soB1I/AAAAAAAAAeE/NTPT2blbtBA/s320/Picture+17.png" /></a></span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">I use CLM everyday in my studio and I like it for its clean layout, easy to understand functionality, and ability (through Filemaker) to put on a shared server and run with all of my workstations in my studio, enabling them to access to the most up-to-date info on where we are on projects. CLM features a simple layout which includes several "screensets" to work from, beginning with the Project Database. </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">The Project Database is an                  overall view of your project which enables you to track the status                  of each cue in the project. You can see if each cue has been composed,                  approved, orchestrated, recorded or which musician already recorded                  in each cue. </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">You can label your cues by usage, description, genre or style                  fields to help identify them within the project, and you can also </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">track                  multiple ensembles (orchestra, band, jazz trio, etc), as well as oversee </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">a detail view of what cues will be recorded                  in which session. The database will automatically calculate                  how many minutes of music need to be recorded per session, providing for you all of the information necessary to then organize the session more efficiently. CLM also allows                  for multiple sessions per day, as well as a great "Change                  Session Date" script that makes changing the date and time                  of a session and its related cues a snap.</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><i>Cue Log Manager</i> also acts as a "Virtual Music Editor", giving you the ability to </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">dynamically create Spotting Notes, Summary Sheets                  and Cue Sheets for your project as it evolves. The <i>spotting notes</i> feature displays start times, stop times,                  length, usage and a short description of each cue as well as length                  totals; the <i>summary sheet</i> option provides a quick overview of all                  the cues in a project and their length and usage; and the <i>cue list</i> page shows a list of each cue in a project with                  all the composer and publisher information as well as length and                  usage, serving as a worksheet for Performing                  Royalty Organizations (such as ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC) cue sheets.</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><i>Cue Log Manager</i> is available for Apple computers running Filemaker Pro 8 or 9 in at least Mac OS 10.3.9. It retails online at the <a href="http://www.powerkeys.com/cuelogmanager.html">Powerkeys website</a> for $89 US.</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><i><b>Cue Chronicle</b></i>, invented by Hollywood ProTools recordist Vincent Cirilli, is also worth taking a look at. <i>Cue Chronicle</i> differs greatly from Cue Log Manager in that it is offerred both as a Filemaker database and also as a standalone runtime application. It is also offers two unique and smart ways to license the application, which I'll explain in a minute.</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: inherit; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm18IQ4vNkI/AAAAAAAAAeM/s0BjOd3lcT8/s1600-h/clistv3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm18IQ4vNkI/AAAAAAAAAeM/s0BjOd3lcT8/s320/clistv3.jpg" /></a></span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">Built certainly more with larger format studio scoring sessions in mind, </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><i>Cue Chronicle (CC)</i> is extensively more user definable than Cue Log Manager because of the way that Vinnie has created it. CC's database is hugely modular which enables the entire app to function like a "central nervous system" for your scoring projects, including whole workspaces devoted soley to indivudual aspects of a scoring project like <i>crew</i>, <i>rigs</i>, <i>drives</i>, <i>reels</i>, <i>contacts</i>, and <i>notes</i>. The vast toolbox of checklists and itemizable charts include important variables such as version tracking, revision tracking, timing changes, takes, tracksheets for recording, and orchestral breakdown with a deep section allowing you to list and keep track of your instrumentation per cue. Everything is color-coded to make it easy to see and simple to monitor at quick glance, and with many fields user-definable, <i>Cue Chronicle</i> makes it pretty difficult to run out of ways to sort content.</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">While Cue Log Manager utilizes a simple challenge and response licensing scheme, <i>Cue Chronicle</i> gives you a choice to tether your license to a particular machine in your studio OR tether the license to a USB memory stick enabling you to travel with the license and software from studio to studio, stage to stage. Pretty handy.</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><i>Cue Chronicle</i> is available from <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/vcirilli/CueChronicle/index.html">Vincent Cirrilli's website</a> and is downloadable for $295 US. It runs on Apple PPC or Intel computers running OS 10.4 and higher, and the optional Filemaker Pro v8 (v9 recommended).<br />

</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>FINDING YOUR "SPOT"</b><br />
When I was just getting started, the biggest problem I had with scoring a film from beginning to end was knowing where the best places were to put music. I was never quite sure early on if I was placing music in the film where the music should *really* be placed, or if I was just sort of guessing as best I could with no real idea of what I was doing. It took me awhile to get really great at spotting. The big problem for me was that I had a very difficult time seeing the entire score as a representative whole from top to bottom. When I would work, I would start writing whichever cue was calling me at the time, not really paying much attention to what I was doing in terms of continuity and sequence. At the end of writing the score, I would invariably end up forgetting something in the thrid or the fourth reel and then having to go back and write what I should have remembered to do while I was there the first time! It was very hard for me to see the overall "big picture" when I was needing to be so tunnel-visioned into what I was doing.</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">If you have issues with not knowing whether or not you are covering everything you need to cover in your scores, or if you are having trouble spotting things on your own, let me offer this as a tip that might help get you thinking about how spotting can help you, and not scare you. You might have seen directors use this method that I am going to describe, but I learned it from an editor that I once worked with that has been using the method of storyboarding on <i><b>Post-It Notes</b></i> for the vast majority of his career.</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">The idea of the <i>Post-It Note Score Storyboard</i> is to take a section of a wall in your writing room (as big a section as you can part with) and use it sort of as a big huge "map" for the storyline, characters, and arc of the film in relation to the musical cues that you will write to coalese with those points on your "map". If you've ever watched or seen a director storyboard a camera shot, then you already know what I am talking about. Its not so much about storyboarding the musicality of a cue as much as it is about storyboarding the cue itself in the timeline of the film's story arc.</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">Start by taking a stack of standard canary yellow Post-It Notes and writing on each note a single event in the film that you feel is pivotal. "KISS" would be the key here: Keep It Simple! On one note you might write the words, "First Day/Harry Gets Up". Another might say, "Car Won't Start". Yet another might say, "Julianne Misses Her Bus". Be <i>specific</i> and be <i>generous</i> &#8212; you can always get rid of the events that you won't write cues for, but once you have evrything up in the timeline, it will be hard to add events without moving all of the subsequent events down the line to compensate.</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: inherit; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm2HISzz2rI/AAAAAAAAAec/blm8YqBMJoU/s1600-h/warroom09.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm2HISzz2rI/AAAAAAAAAec/blm8YqBMJoU/s200/warroom09.jpg" /></a></span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">Arrange these canary yellow "timeline" notes on the wall, left to right, in the sequence in which they occur as the film plays out. After you are finished, you should have a visual representation of the film's timeline made up of yellow Post-It Notes.</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">After you have the whole film represented with the canary yellow notes, take another stack of Post-Its that is a decidely different color from the yellow ones you just used to timeline the film. Maybe these are going to be Hot Pink. Designate these Hot Pink notes as the "cues" of your score. Take yet <i>another</i> set of a different color (green, orange, blue, purple... whatever floats your boat!) and make that your "Theme" color. Take a third set of a different color still and make these your "Motif" notes. You get the picture.</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">Then, loosely decide (because I promise, you'll change your mind about twenty million times!) where to put the hot pink CUE notes on the yellow timeline. Once that set has been exhausted, grab your THEME color and place those over the CUE notes where you think a main theme or character theme would be nice. After that, take you MOTIF color and place some of those over the THEME notes where you think your <i>Main Motif</i> might work nicley and communicate what's happening in a scene. Pretty soon, after a lot of going back and forth, sticking and unsticking, moving and shuffling, you'll have a fairly decent jumping-off point in which to begin scoring your new feature.</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">Use this method to really experiment and try stuff you don't think you should try! Often, those are the happiest of accidents and sometimes end up being the catalysts by which inspiration is born... and Oscars are awarded!</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">These are only a couple of ideas I have to get you thinking about your workflow and how maybe you can either make it more efficient (Cue Log Manager or Cue Chronicle) or dance outside the fire a bit with regards to how you plan your scores (Post-It Note spotting). I'd like to hear your ideas for mixing up your workflow in your studios and writing rooms....</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />

<br />
I defy any reader of SCOREcast Online to submit a term, in the comments, that I can't make relevant in some way to film scoring.</b><br />
<br />
Leave your entry in the comments; I'll do my part by replying with the connection (as quickly as I can: if there's a deluge of comments&#8212;and I hope there will be!&#8212;it'll take me a little while to summon the cleverness to reply to them all).<br />
<br />
Your term can be any (G-rated, please) word or phrase. For example:<br />
Your term: <b>Trafalgar Square</b>.<br />
<div>My response: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafalgar_Square">Trafalgar Square</a>, located in central London, is a public forum for the display of art, just as film scoring is the display of our art (film music) in a public forum (the film itself). It is an intersection point&#8212;of major London thoroughfares&#8212;just as film composing is the intersection of many disparate elements&#8212;music, storytelling, technology, etc. Like the best film music, Trafalgar Square is easily accessible to anyone&#8212;a reminder that making your music connect to the audience requires a similarly clear point of access.<br />
<br />
Like our composing rigs, Trafalgar Square is in a constant state of re-invention to integrate the latest technology (the most recent work to Trafalgar Square being a pump system and LED lighting, installed in May 2009).<br />
<br />
Finally, Trafalgar Square, like the career of film music, must contend with the ongoing issue of congestion: a multitude of people trying to get in, with room for only so many at any given time. :-)<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm betting you won't be able to stump me. Maybe in the future we'll do this contest with voting and prizes and all of that; for now, though, it's simply respect that's at stake. (What am I getting into here?!)<br />
<br />
The cut-off time for this challenge is Sunday at 11:59 P.M., Los Angeles time (i.e., submissions arriving on Monday morning won't be answered).<br />
<br />
So get busy, SCOREcasters&#8212;hit me with your best shot.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><b> I dare you.</b></div></div>

Does it just bug the ever-loving crap out you, like it does me, when you play your hard work for your director only to have him or her look at you blankly and utter the words "That just doesn't work for me"?<br />
<br />
I hate hearing those words come out of my director's mouth. I want him or her to be pleased on first listen. Of course, it doesn't always work that way and it is our job as the composer to find out why it doesn't work that way. Music is so subjective and so personal that I often wonder privately things I'd never share with anyone, like "Who beat the hell out of this director so bad as a child to make him not like this cue for this scene?"<br />
<br />
I have traversed far and wide to search out all possible answers to the question as to why, if you line five directors up against a wall and ask them to watch a scene with music, will you get five differing answers from each. This, of course, is an unanswerable question... perhaps answered only by discovering why *you* hear music the way you hear it and particularly why certain music, to your ears, would never fit in a certain scene.<br />
<br />
We've all sat and listened to film scores independent of film to hear what others are doing or to study the greats and learn from them. The problem with that &#8212; and arguably, the problem with the concept of "film music critics" &#8212; is that the purpose and function of a piece of film music is essentially null and void when divorced from picture. With that rational, the very act of listening to a piece of film detached from the picture from whence it came is only half the story. It might be a nice listening experience, but you are still only getting part of the intended result.<br />
<br />
My girlfriend is a <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costume_designer" rel="wikipedia" title="Costume designer">costume designer</a>. Our lives are a whirlwind of film events, one after the other, hers then mine then hers then mine. Recently, for the first time, I scored a film where she was also the principle wardrobe supervisor during production. It was a great experience seeing her styling and coloring choices explode onscreen while my music passed by in the underscore. As creatives, our workflows are similar, with slight differences. When I am working on menial administrative tasks like cutting demos, returning emails, or prepping my assistant's schedule for the next week, I listen to film scores via my iTunes library. In another part of the house is my her workspace. When she is taking care of all of the administrative duties that her business requires, she watches movies on DVD or our Apple TV... with the volume turned <i>off</i>.<br />
<br />
I always found this incredibly interesting... she watches movies with no sound. Seems weird, until you remember that she's not listening for score, FX, or dialog... she's looking at <i>costumes</i>.<br />
<br />
Her process &#8212; in its entirety, from conception of a costume to the final product being fitted on the actor &#8212; completely blows me away and fascinates me. I have taken many cues from the way she works and incorporated many of her routines into my way of working as a composer. In addition, I have taken the way that she studies film and tried to apply it to the way I study film. What has resulted is a mash-up of looking at film and music in an effort to better understand why it is that music works why it is that sometimes it doesn't. <br />
<br />
Here is what it looks like: From time to time &#8212; and *only* with time to burn, mind you &#8212; I'll put on an old movie or a recent release and turn the sound completely <i>off</i>. Then I'll launch my iTunes library and set the filter controls so that only MY music shows up in the browser. As the film plays, I'll "temp" my music into the film by simply pushing "PLAY" when a scene comes up that I feel needs music. I'll experiment &#8212; I'll put things in that I think would fit well, or put things in that are completely from another genre just to see what works and what... um... doesn't. (Imagine "<a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt114369/" rel="imdb" title="Seven (film)">SE7EN</a>" with tunes from that <i>sports comedy</i> you just finished!)<br />
<br />
This process teaches me a TON. Not only do I learn what not to do, but I have also learned that in film music, and filmmaking in general, there are *no* rules. Everything is on the table. Therefore, sometimes, a serious scene works better with a comedic score or a slightly quirkier feel to the music. Conversely, we've all seen many great film composer legends play against comedy with a serious tone in the accompanying score.<br />
<br />
Playing around with these kinds of things really enables you to learn "privately" and make mistakes on your own dime that canand should NEVER be made on your director's.<br />
<br />
This is one small, and maybe silly, way to "think" about how film music works and how it won't... but it <i>"works for me"</i>.<br />

You stumble into your studio early one morning and there's a Hard Truth perched on top of your computer monitor, smirking at you:<b> There is not enough time to do everything.</b><br />
<div><div><br />
Stealthy beads of flop-sweat reconnoiter your forehead, scouting the terrain for a full-scale assault later in the afternoon. Your fingers go a little numb. You remember to breathe&#8212;<i>deeply, slowly, methodically</i>&#8212;but it's too late to do anything but call the production company and beg for mercy.<br />
<br />
Don't say you weren't warned. If you're lucky enough to have a gig, chances are you're intimately familiar with this scenario already.<br />
<br />
Welcome to <b>Crunch Time</b>&#8230; a.k.a. Standard Operating Procedure in the wild and wonderful world of 21st-century filmmaking, where it's always a rush job and always a panic.<br />
<br />
Executives nowadays are in the habit of doing to composers the same thing they do to everyone else on the filmmaking team&#8212;namely, pushing them to their physical and psychological breaking point in order to minimize production time and costs. It's simply good business for them. (If we drop dead of a heart attack, the only real downside for them is the hour or so it takes to find a replacement). Sure, this makes our professional lives less fun, but more importantly: it leaves <i>zero</i> room for error.<br />
<br />
So here are some things you can do now, today, to survive the crunch. I learned almost all of these myself the hard way, and have returned to tell the tale. Learn from my mistakes, and when crunch time hits&#8230;<b><br />
<br />
Don't go changing&#8230;</b><br />
This is cliché-obvious&#8230; but people do it all the time. Upgrading operating systems, adding that latest must-have piece of gear, experimenting with a new template or new way of delivering your materials&#8230; it's a seductive thing, because these are all important. We all feel the pressure to stay current with our studio equipment&#8212;but there's a time and place. If you're lucky enough to have <i>constant</i> work, the best way to reconcile this is to have a "B" rig up and running, where you (or better yet, your assistant) can add things&#8230; change them around&#8230; encounter and solve problems in a non-mission-critical setting. Once you've figured out how to make your new goodies run porperly on the "B" rig, then and only then should they make their way into your main workstation. Sounds like a pain in the rear&#8212;but it's nothing compared to the pain you'll feel if your system fails catastrophically on the morning of final music delivery.</div><div><b><br />
Eliminate the nickel-and-dime stuff.</b></div><div>Not only do those three- and five-minute distractions add up to real time, but they also make it impossible to sustain your attention in exactly the way that's necessary for you to do your best work. Delegate, postpone, and above all&#8230; get used to saying <i>no</i>. Ruthlessly and with a clear conscience. No one will ever care as much about your career as you do. Go back to Jai Meghan's <a href="2009/06/balance-of-byrds.html">post</a> about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Things_First_%28book%29">Covey Quadrant System</a> and memorize that sucker. Apply it to your to-do list before you start each day.<br />
<br />
While you're at it, commit to putting away the e-mail and the Facebook and the Twitter when it's time to work. Develop your own version of what Deane Ogden refers to as "cloak mode." There's a way to do this without being an antisocial jerk&#8212;find it, try it, refine it, perfect it.<b><br />
<br />
Back up files as though your professional life depended on it.</b></div><div>Because it does. And use redundant backups&#8212;one backup, in one location, is simply not enough. Drive space and blank media is cheap. Your career is priceless. You do the math.<b><br />
<br />
Avoid the <i>wrong</i> shortcuts.</b><br />
Here's where knowing your craft is going to save you some time. Everyone wants a secret weapon or two, a set of never-fail shortcuts that will get them through the night with time to spare. Most shortcuts, though, are a sucker bet. Eventually they're going to get you branded as amateur or sloppy. Let's approach this one in terms of "dos and don'ts," and I'll point out some of the worst offenders along the way.<i><br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">Don't</span></i> abuse the copy/paste function to get through minutes of music. Instead, <i><span style="color: red;">do</span></i> get the most out of your compositional material by trying things like varying the texture (register, voicing and/or timbre), and applying all those Comp 101 techniques we all learned: retrograde, diminution and augmentation,  et al. In short, manipulate as many variables as you can to maximize the musical material you've already created. Copy/paste can be your friend, but only as a starting point.<br />
<br />
I get demos from aspiring composers all the time&#8230; and one of the things that makes me crazy is when the sender wastes my time by shoving the same 1-bar ostinato down my ear-holes, over and over. No changes. No development. Like a rollercoaster without the hills. Makes me feel stabby.<i><br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">Don't</span></i> waste time on tone patrol. Minutes can trickle into hours as you try out sound after sound after inappropriate sound, looking for the perfect kick drum or the just-right glassy pad. Instead, <i style="color: red;">do</i> database your sound libraries in advance by emotion, tone, usefulness&#8230; whatever works for you. And build the best stuff into a permanent writing template (with plenty of room in that template to add sounds unique to each new project). Doing all this ahead of time also means you can be much more focused and much pickier about those sounds you allow into your palette on a one-time-only basis.</div><div></div><div><i><span style="color: red;">Don't</span><span style="font-style: normal;"> abandon your "sequencing hygiene." Set your default controller values at the start of the sequence, just as you'd do if you weren't in a crunch. Take the time to create new files and new versions using the same nomenclature and organizational system as always (even if it takes a few seconds longer). <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: normal;">Fill in the meter and tempo changes correctly in your sequence&#8212;don't slop your way through 'em to save time. Type in the patch names for any new MIDI tracks. In short, </span><span style="color: red;">do</span><span style="font-style: normal;"> adhere to all the good, hygenic sequencing habits you already possess. If you have to do revisions later, this can make the difference between an annoyance and a crisis. By the way, setting these sequences up (or having an assistant set them up!) ahead of time is a very good idea. Not always possible, but a huge time-saver.</span></span></span></i></div><div><i><br />
<span style="color: red;">Don't</span></i> skimp on the post-compositional details just because you're in a time crunch, either. Instead, <i style="color: red;">do</i> factor in the time it's going to take to log your cues, back up your work (see above), prep the delivery in a professional manner and do any other peripheral tasks you might be tempted to let slide. Unless you're in a position to delegate these responsibilities, you may have even less writing time than you think. Sloppy delivery materials signify to the recipient that you don't value your own work. Simple.<i><br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">Don't</span></i> rush. I find that I get more composed, more quickly, by forcing myself to go slowly, especially at the outset of a long writing stretch. <i style="color: red;">Do</i> think each action through. Let the natural rhythm of your sequencing and thinking and playing assert itself. The speed will develop on its own. Only by staying relaxed can you achieve anything approaching Jedi speed at the sequencer. Watch a great jazz pianist&#8212;look at his or her hands. See how comfortable they are? Same principle.<i><br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">Don't</span></i> skip the ear-breaks. At least once an hour, <i style="color: red;">do</i> get up and stretch a bit. Walk away from the rig, even if it's just for two or three minutes. Hydrate. Take a few deep breaths. Just stay away from the Facebook&#8230; or anything else that might break the flow. This built-in break time is not for working on other things! It's for re-focusing and re-energizing and re-acquiring some sense of objectivity about what you're doing.</div><div></div><div>Speaking of skipping things&#8230; <i><span style="color: red;">don't</span></i> skip meals. Food is fuel. So <i><span style="color: red;">do</span></i> hydrate, eat properly (stocking the fridge with healthy snacks ahead of time is extremely smart), in small portions and at a reasonable pace. Just like your mom told you. :-)</div><div></div><div><b><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: red;"><i>Don't</i></span> start writing cues without a road map. This one is </span>huge<span style="font-weight: normal;">. It's tempting to panic a bit during Crunch Time&#8230; bringing up the template and playing in a bunch of notes just to stay a step ahead of the ticking clock. That's not composing&#8212;it's wishful thinking, pouring out of your fingertips. It's the compositional version of a lottery ticket, with about the same odds of success.</span></b></div><div>It feels proactive and dynamic&#8212;hey, I'm <i>launching</i> into this thing like a rocketship! I'm gonna rip this score out in no time!&#8212;but hard-earned experience allows me to tell you this: You will spend more time ripping out musical ideas that don't work in the larger context of the score (or even of a single cue, if it's a long-ish one).</div><div>Instead, <i><span style="color: red;">do</span></i> invest time at the outset of the project to define the arc of the score in your mind, and the individual arcs of each cue within the score. Re-visit your spotting notes. Observe the editing rhythm. In short, create your road map. Then the ideas that occur to you to write will be contextualized&#8230; predicated upon your best understanding of the narrative you are trying to enhance. Anything else is just shooting arrows randomly into the forest.</div><div></div><div>One last one: <i><span style="color: red;">don't</span></i> switch "hats." Instead, <i><span style="color: red;">do</span></i> complete all the writing you have to do for the session, then all the sequencing (if, as most of us do nowadays, you write at the sequencer, these will of course be a single step&#8230; but for some pencil-and-paper folks even these can be made separate), then all the recording, then all the mixing, then all the outputs and layback. Don't jump around. You'll be more efficient, more focused, and develop a faster pace by sticking to one phase of the process at a time. If you're not in Crunch Time, it may be more fun to flit around as you write, but I'd discourage it even then&#8212;you're reinforcing sub-optimal work habits.</div><div></div><div>What you want to create with all of these do's and don'ts is a habitual calmness. A routine that will not only maximize your productivity, but will shield you against panic. Think Jason Bourne&#8230; the crazier the situation gets, the calmer and more methodical he becomes.</div><div></div><div><b>Know what to Expect</b></div><div>Once you've done a few of these, you'll know the shape of the battle. Till then, here are some of the things that initially caught me by surprise along the way:</div><div></div><div><i>Expect to spend up to half of your composing time working out the transitions.</i> You'll be cranking along for eight, maybe sixteen bars with everything working fine&#8230; knowing there's a tonal shift (or a dramatically important cut, or some other sort of change) coming up soon. You know what you're going to write in the next section, too&#8212;but getting between the two is tough! Making the score sound inevitable, smooth and unobtrusive in these transitional moments is one of the toughest things we have to do. Doing it well simply takes time. The takeaway here: don't panic if you spend a lot of time getting these transitional moments right. It's worth it&#8212;they're inevitably the ones that get flagged with notes from the filmmakers if we fake our way through 'em. Which, of course, makes it a net time winner to get 'em done properly the first time.</div><div></div><div><i>Save, save, save&#8230; and still expect to lose some work.</i> When we're under a tight deadline we tend to run our machines harder than usual. Finicky beasts that they are, they tend to pick just these moments to get all crashy. Get in the habit of saving your work every few keystrokes. The habitual nature of that motion is the important part&#8212;when your concentration is focused on the writing and sequencing, saving regularly is one of those things that <i>will</i> slip your mind. Making it an unconscious habit gives you at least a chance of escaping with most of your data intact. And when your system does crash? I recommend looking at it as a challenge&#8212;looking at it as an opportunity to write something even better in place of what was lost.</div><div></div><div><i>Expect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation">sleep deprivation</a> to decrease your efficiency.</i> It's biologically inevitable. Your brain will fuzz out as those hours tick by. Your physical reaction time will slow. You'll find yourself looking at the screen and not really knowing how long you've been sitting there, looking at the screen. Find a strategy&#8212;different people have different favorites here; I'd love to hear thoughts on this one in the comments!&#8212;and simply know you're going to have to implement it. See "Respect Yourself," below&#8212;and take it from me that no gig is worth compromising your health. If you're at that point, you've either signed on for something beyond your capacity, or you've failed to plan properly. Either way, my advice at that point is to give up, beg for mercy, and live to write another day. I hope that this article begins a thought process for you (especially if you're just starting out in this biz!) that prevents that scenario from ever coming to pass.</div><div></div><div>Finally, after all this gloom and doom, here's a happy expectation to round out this section: <i>Expect the last cue you write to get finished <b>much</b> faster than the first cue, note-for-note.</i> Biological limitations aside, you will naturally pick up incredible speed as the project goes along&#8212;mostly because you're becoming more familiar with how this score "goes" as you write. If you've already mapped out the territory (see above), a part of your brain will be thinking ahead, figuring things out subconsciously, laying the groundwork to make the last few cues fall into place naturally&#8230; perhaps even inevitably. If you've managed it right, you'll be flying along at a superhuman pace as the work comes to its end. And the best part? The longer the project, the greater this effect becomes. Toward the end of a feature-length picture I find myself writing up to ten minutes a day&#8230; that's how comfortable I've become in the world of that score.</div><div><b><br />
Stock up in advance.</b><br />
Buy ink cartridges, copy paper, etc. on a one-ahead basis. Simple, but so easily to skip when the moment arrives. No excuses or sympathy for botching this one.<b><br />
<br />
Give your loved ones some lead time.</b></div><div>Sometimes this is impossible&#8212;a last-minute gig comes blazing into the studio&#8212;but if we're being honest we can usually see these crises coming. Let the people in your life know, and do it as soon as you can. It's easier for people to accept what they've been prepared for in advance. That goes for you (hence this article!), and it goes for your friends and family, too.<b><br />
<br />
Respect Yourself</b>.<br />
If you put yourself in the hospital&#8212;and I mean that literally; I've <i>seen it happen</i>&#8212;in order to deliver a score in half your "normal time," the only thing that will happen as a result is that your "normal time," in the minds of the people you're working for, gets cut in half. Congratulations&#8230; you've just made your job physically impossible without damaging your health, perhaps permanently. And you didn't even get a raise. Good job.<br />
</div><div><b>Summing up&#8230;</b><br />
Our most valuable commodity is time. As artists we strive for relevance, for influence&#8212;for paying gigs!&#8212;but in the end, what we're playing for as <i>human beings</i> is simply&#8230; time.</div><div><div>In reading this article, I hope you feel you've used yours wisely. Now go do the thing. Go write some music.</div></div></div></div>

Goldsmith's music, whether by accident or pure purpose, was a major influence on many of us in our decisions to take on this career and try to reach even a fraction of the height that he was able to during his time at the podium.<br /><br />I am of the opinion that when Jerry Goldsmith passed, so did something else... the<p class="zemanta-img zemanta-action-dragged" style="margin: 1em; float: right; display: block;"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jerry%2BGoldsmith"><img src="http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/2148656.jpg" alt="Jerry Goldsmith" style="border: medium none ; display: block;" /></a><span class="zemanta-img-attribution"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jerry%2BGoldsmith">Jerry Goldsmith</a> via <a href="http://www.lasftm.com">last.fm</a></span></p>matic writing. It will surely be argued that <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002354/" rel="imdb" title="John Williams">John Williams</a> is perhaps the last "living legend" in film music. However, I felt that once Jerry was gone, even Williams began to rest on his laurels a little, and with the latest <span style="font-style: italic;">Indiana Jones</span> film, trail a bit into what I've heard termed as "smash-and-grab" scoring.<br /><br />I first heard the term "smash-and-grab" in a lecture during my second year at USC. The lecturer was referring to the types of scores that emphasize bombastic and chaotic "noise" over carefully-crafted, thematic writing. You know, the kind that almost every big-budget studio feature has affixed to their tent-pole summer films these days!<br /><br />It seems that now, more than ever, that the recipe for "scoring" is to hold down a key on a controller to loop a gigantic taiko sequence, then, on the second pass, hold another key down and add the Absynth pad to give the new "cue" some depth. Furthermore, with the advent of things like "Symphobia" and the forthcoming "Hollywood Strings" libraries, it is easier than ever to be lazy and still sound amazing. It seems lately that even with the most effort put forth, a composer might write a bare theme, but nothing that is hummable as you walk out of the theater or attaches any kind of musical memory to the film for the audience.<br /><br />In the wake of Deane's question from <a href="2009/07/fixers.html">yesterday</a> about a score's affect on a film, I wonder what it is that has made the "smash-and-grab" score so trendy lately. Who started the downward spiral and why are the studios so happy to buy in? Is it because audiences have been dumbed down so much that they really do not care if a film's music leaves any kind of lasting effect? Or is it because we have passed the point of being able to truly enjoy a film for "entertainment's sake" and we therefore do not have the capacity as humans anymore to appreciate a visual stimuli that has an aural one accompanying it?<br /><br />When I browse <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Reporter</span></a> or read <span style="font-style: italic;"><a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_%28magazine%29" rel="wikipedia" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></span> and see which composers are working on which films, I see a new group of composers who are making a name for themselves as "smash-and-grab" film composers. It saddens me greatly to see poster after poster at the theater with any of these composers' names in the block because I cannot help but think that once I get my shot at a large feature, their method of churning out these awful scores is going to be the norm. Will that mean that I am going to be asked to imitate a cheap sounding score? What will that do to my value as a new guy trying to get my career out of first gear? There are many composers who are basically not hirable due to that very syndrome already!<br /><br />In my memory, there has not been a truly hummable theme that has come out of a film score in the last five years. If you can think of one, please speak up, because I honestly cannot. My hope is that someone here, in the SCOREcast community, will be the next great writer to give us a memorable theme along the lines of Goldsmith's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066206/"><span style="font-style: italic;">Patton</span></a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060177/"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Blue Max</span></a>, or even his later work on the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462499/" rel="imdb" title="Rambo (film)">Rambo</a></span> series and <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek" rel="wikipedia" style="font-style: italic;" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> franchise.<br /><br />Is there a market for thematic writing in film today, and if so, for those us who are realistically 5+ years away from entering the industry in earnest, will it still be there when we finally arrive and need it to be? <br /><br />     <div style="margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;" class="zemanta-pixie"><a class="zemanta-pixie-a" href="http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/69b7ddbb-cd28-4366-9741-d5cfa7b050f9/" title="Reblog this post [with Zemanta]"><img style="border: medium none ; float: right;" class="zemanta-pixie-img" src="http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=69b7ddbb-cd28-4366-9741-d5cfa7b050f9" alt="Reblog this post [with Zemanta]" /></a><span class="zem-script more-related pretty-attribution"><script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js" defer="defer"></script></span></div></div>

Hi guys, this week I'd like to go a bit off the general theme, and talk about something which I'm recently discovering as I travel Oz - taking time out from composing, and how it can be beneficial to you as a composer, and even as a person.<br />
<br />
Late February of this year, I decided to go travelling around Australia with a friend for a year - working and travelling as we go.  So far, its been an amazing adventure, and we've had so much fun, seen so many things, and I've got a lot of inspiration from it.  We're about half way through the trip now, and I'm looking back at what I've learnt, seen and heard along the way as I sit here at a bar in Mission Beach, taking it easy :)<br />
<br />
Taking it from the start of the trip, at the very beginning, I was thinking a number of things about my career and how it could be beneficial or detrimental to it - one thing in particular I remember thinking  was "how on earth am I going to do without being able to compose for an entire year"? I love coming home from work and being able to sit down and create music.  At the start of the trip it was hard - I really really wanted to make music, or at least do something related to my career.  I felt almost guilty for enjoying myself and for taking the time out to see the world.  After a few weeks however, I started to settle in a little bit more, and I opened my eyes to what was out there.<br />
<br />
I started to realise that I was actually helping myself further down the road by taking this time out - in the last 5 months, I've experienced and seen so much, that I think I'm going to be a better composer for it.  We all know how hard it can be sometimes to find inspiration in those tight deadlines, and I think this break is giving me a lot of inspiration.  Apart from these experiences, this break in composition and playing has given my brain enough space and down time to almost "recover" from the conditioning we unkowingly slip into, slowly but surely, in the fast and fun world of composing.<br />
<br />
I suppose what I'm getting to in this month's column is that sometimes, you really <span style="font-style: italic;">need </span>to take a break, whether you think you do or not.  I really can't express how much good I think this break has done for me, as its given me enough time and space to look back on my music, my career - everything really - and to take a deep breath and look at it all in perspective.  Thats the main thing I'd like to point out I suppose - taking a break or going travelling can give you so much <span style="font-style: italic;">perspective</span>, that you'll sometimes find yourself just laughing out loud as you start to piece different things together that you previously couldn't comprehend or deal with.<br />
<br />
Taking a break and/or travelling  can also open up all of your senses - being composers, we have to use all of our senses to create the emotional music we do and having the experiences to draw on, can give you that push up above the rest.   Of course, the most obvious thing about travelling is the huge amount of diverse music you're exposed to as you move around - while I lived in Melbourne, we heard everything from live Greek music and Indian music, to traditional Japanese and Thai celebrational music. The effect that has on you can be quite profound when you've never heard anything like it before - let alone seen it live (I'm hoping to see some Gamelan music at some stage which would be awesome!).<br />
<br />
Anyway, as usual I've rambled, so I'll leave you with a picture of a balloon ride my girlfriend and I went on, to give you an idea of the kind of inspiration you might get from taking a break, and going <span style="font-style: italic;">Off the Beaten Track</span> now and again :)<br />

My director wanted me to come up to the Bay Area and be on set so that I could grasp the vibe of a crucial action scene at the end of the film where the hero of the story meets his nemesis and the two go mano-a-mano in an old decrepit and abandoned cannery building.<br />
<br />
I have not visited a set on one of my films in a long time, and I had forgotten the beauty of the controlled environment that a film set is. I listened carefully to what the crew was saying to one another. I was there to learn. I was there to soak up every bit of the environment that I could.<br />
<br />
I certainly got what I went for, and then some. I totally get what my director was after for me, and I came home and launched into some really great themes that I think he is going to love. I realized, however, that being on our side of the production is where I like to be. Post-production.<br />
<br />
I'm not a pre-production guy, nor a production guy. I could never be a movie producer. It's just not my bag. There is a stress on a set that is palpable enough to keep me away from all of the craze that comes with it. It is a fun process, but just a different one that I would not enjoy for 6 months at a time. On sets, you hear things. Things you don't like to hear when you know you are going into <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-production" rel="wikipedia" title="Post-production">post</a> with what they are doing and are going to be left with the task of finishing what has been started. You hear things under all of the chit-chat amongst the crew that really make you wonder.<br />
<br />
<i>"This is the longest shoot I've ever been on!"<br />
"When's lunch? I'm bored."<br />
"Why is the DP using this shot instead of (insert idea). I would do it this way..."<br />
"Man, this actor is bad!"</i><br />
<i>"I want the credit that he's getting. He doesn't deserve *that* credit."<br />
"We'll fix it in post!"</i><br />
<br />
Wha...What? <i>"We'll fix it in post"?</i><br />
<br />
Did I hear that right? I mean, most of those I could give two craps about... but wait a minute!! Fix it in post??... are you serious?<br />
<br />
Of course they are. That phrase has been around since dawn of <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking" rel="wikipedia" title="Filmmaking">filmmaking</a>. And we are the ones that should do it, right? I mean, that's what *we* do... we are <i>fixers.</i><br />
<br />
<i>"We'll fix it in post"</i> is never a good thing for a <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score" rel="wikipedia" title="Film score">film composer</a> to hear. Not only does it usually mean that you are going to be the one on the hook for writing over and correcting a bad performance, fixing bad dialog, or musically stringing together a weak <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematography" rel="wikipedia" title="Cinematography">cinematography</a> sequence, but to my notion it also means that people are getting tired and they are ready to be done. This is never good on a film set. That is when mistakes get made that go unchecked, decisions get made that might be fuzzy on logic, and shots are let out the door that really should have been thought through better. Then, in post-production, we are left with the task (along with the picture editor, music editor, sound FX engineers, and loop group artists) of "fixing" whatever went wrong.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to this month's Composer Confab discussion starter. We have all seen "bad" films where the score was better than the movie itself. Conversely, we've also all seen great films that were brought down a notch or two by horribly distracting film scores. To take it a bit further, we've also all heard the argument that the transparency of a film score is a measuring stick as to how good it is. Is this our job? Shouldn't we be given a 100% product so that we might then put our 100% into it and make it 200% of the best movie ever?<br />
<br />
So let me ask you:<br />
<br />
<blockquote><b>Can a <i>great score</i> fix a <i>bad film</i>?<br />
</b></blockquote><br />
Of course, this discussion will also spill over into asking whether or not a bad score can ruin a great film. What makes a good score? What makes a bad film? Is there anything that can truly fix a bad film? Are some films so damned good that even a bad score still makes them "great"?<br />
<br />
I know there are so many opinions on this matter, and so I pose it to you... The best people I can think of to ask... The Fixers. The "white knights" of the post-production process. The composers.<br />
<br />
Let's hear your take!<br />

<div><b>Composers should know as little about music as possible.</b><br />
<br />
OK, I realize it's a bit of a leap even to consider this one. It's what we do. We <i>have to</i> know our stuff&#8230; right? What good is it even to start down this path&#8212;even if the provocation (as usual) is not intended to be taken as a statement of fact, but merely as a thought-tool?<br />
<br />
When I wrote this one, I was immediately drawn to the word "know" in the sentence. It reminds me of rigidity, of being locked into a single unchanging mode of thinking or working. And that is something that we might very well wish to avoid.<br />
<br />
What does this weekend's provocation suggest to you? How could it be interpreted in a useful way? Does it give you any sort of insights that you might not otherwise have arrived at?</div><div>Hop in on the comments&#8212;that's what this article is all about, after all. Otherwise it's just me writing silly sentences on a Friday. :-)</div></div>

<br />
Well, the short answer is that for most of your work you shouldn&#8217;t care, but if you are using large sample libraries, stick around.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: arial;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: georgia;"><b><i>Editorial note:</i></b><i> I won&#8217;t get into all the things needed to make your computer 64-bit ready. There are many great computer articles and discussions based on your type of computer. Suffice it to say, to completely take advantage of 64-bit architecture your machine needs to have 64-bit processors and architecture. You need a 64-bit <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system" rel="wikipedia" title="Operating system">OS</a> and 64-bit applications, not to mention drivers, etc.</i></span></span><br />

<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: georgia; font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">I won&#8217;t make this too technical. In computers we deal with binary numbers and fixed memory (<a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory" rel="wikipedia" title="Random-access memory">RAM</a>) limitations based on the architecture of your computer. </span><span style="font-size: 100%;"> </span><span style="font-size: 100%;">32-bit architectures and memory space basically gives your computer the ability to use up to 4GB of RAM. </span><span style="font-size: 100%;"> </span><span style="font-size: 100%;">Now 64-bit offers 2</span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><sup>64</sup></span><span style="font-size: 100%;"> addresses, equivalent to approximately 17.2 billion <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte" rel="wikipedia" title="Gigabyte">gigabytes</a>, 16.8 million </span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terabyte">terabytes</a></span><span style="font-size: 100%;">, or 16 </span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exabyte">exabytes</a></span><span style="font-size: 100%;"> of RAM. Now that&#8217;s a whole lot of memory... enough to score using every sample library in existence all loaded in RAM.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: georgia; font-family: georgia;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: georgia; font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">For everyday use, checking email and reading SCOREcastOnline.com, 32-bit memory is just fine. Only when we start using programs that access large amounts of data, (samples, photos, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_video" rel="wikipedia" title="High-definition video">HD video</a> and geographic type data) we want as much of this data in RAM as possible, so we don&#8217;t have to keep going back to the hard drive to get more. By having more RAM available, it&#8217;s faster to compose by allowing your whole or majority of your orchestral library loaded and ready to go in RAM for the fastest access possible. Don&#8217;t confuse this with disk streaming. (Another way to get large sample libraries to play with limited amounts of RAM.)</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: georgia; font-family: georgia;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: georgia; font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Even with these basics, there are always additional technical considerations and exceptions. </span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><b>For example:</b></span><span style="font-size: 100%;"> The Mac platform has touted a 64-bit architecture even though the 64-bit version of <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X" rel="wikipedia" title="Mac OS X">OSX</a> &#8220;Snow Leopard&#8221; is not even released yet. The Mac has been able to address more than 4GB of physical RAM for a while now. The low level kernel and drivers use 32-bits and each process or application can address 4GB of RAM. This is why you can have many applications and large amounts of data open in excess of 4GB.</span></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: georgia; font-family: georgia;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: georgia; font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">So your new computer has 8GB of physical RAM, you load up your wonderful template including your soft sampler that you learned from our last lesson.

I have my DAW loaded with a few instances of soft samplers loaded with basic percussion, strings, drums, horns, and other keyboard effects. This allows me some CPU room for audio tracks and other plug-ins to use. I quickly can get close to the RAM limit just in my DAW, even though my computer physically has 14 GB of RAM. So I use Bidule via rewire in combination with my DAW. I&#8217;m using other instances of plugs, including Mach 5v2, Kontakt 3 and a few extra drum plugs.

I want to know how I can create various timbres, textures, and effects &#8211; that communicate emotions and moods &#8211; using combinations of instruments and playing techniques.  By studying scores, listening to performances, and emulating, I aim to unlock the secrets of great composers who, either long ago or recently, have written music that moves my soul.

You&#8217;ve heard it&#8217;s important to make your MIDI mockups as realistic as you can.  Perhaps, when you hear <span style="font-style: italic;">realistic</span>, you think <span style="font-style: italic;">sample libraries</span>.  What VI could sound more realistic than one based on recordings of an actual acoustic instrument?<br />
<br />
It&#8217;s a good thought, but <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_%28music%29" rel="wikipedia" title="Sampling (music)">sampling</a> technology has its limitations.  In this article, I discuss some of these disadvantages and explore an alternative technology, based on a form of <span style="font-style: italic;"><a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_synthesis" rel="wikipedia" title="Additive synthesis">additive synthesis</a></span>, that might better suit some of your needs.  Sample-based VIs play back instrument waveforms that were previously captured verbatim and stored in a library.   In contrast, additive synthesis is a particular way of <span style="font-style: italic;">mathematically modeling</span> the acoustic waves produced by a real instrument and the instrument-dependent manner in which these waves change in response to input (e.g., breath, bowing, fingering, etc.).  When you need to hear the instrument&#8217;s sound, the model is used to <span style="font-style: italic;">compute </span>a waveform on the fly.  This waveform doesn&#8217;t purport to be identical to the waveform the real instrument would have produced, but does aim to be perceptually very similar.<br />
<br />
An effective variant of this modeling technique is the basis of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Wallander Interactive Virtual Instrument</span> (WIVI) family, offered by <a href="http://www.wallanderinstruments.com/">Wallander Instruments</a>.  Existing WIVIs are explicitly oriented toward those composing for traditional instruments (though you can invent non-traditional ones).  The combination of features offered by WIVIs is certainly intriguing, if not unique in the current marketplace.  Instrument rendition is better than skeptical sampling addicts might expect, and in my own case, is often closer to my expectations than what I get from my samples.  If I don&#8217;t like what I&#8217;m hearing, I can probably improve it, because WIVI sound is highly malleable.  If you&#8217;ve ever tried tweaking MIDI mockups to sound more realistic, you know how important this can be, but may have noted that sampling technology offers limited adjustability at a detailed level.  Most striking is that when you combine multiple WIVIs into orchestral ensembles, the result doesn&#8217;t sound &#8220;phasey&#8221;, organ-like, or otherwise unnatural, but rather convincingly realistic.  Wallander attributes this to slight randomization of several attributes of each instrument&#8217;s sound, calling this feature <span style="font-style: italic;">performance randomization</span>.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;m actually using brass and woodwind WIVIs, in addition to sampling and several other technologies, in my studio right now.   If you&#8217;re trying to decide how to spend your precious dollars and time, learning about WIVIs might aid your decision process.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Computational Issues, and System Cost</span><br />
Let&#8217;s compare WIVIs with sampling-based VIs, beginning with computing requirements.  Typical sample libraries contain many gigabytes of sample data.  Most sample data must be read from disk, in real time, at the moment it&#8217;s needed.  If you&#8217;re running many sample-based VIs (i.e., to mock up a full orchestra), you need one or more big, fast disks dedicated to your sample libraries.  You likely need more than 4 Gbytes of <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory" rel="wikipedia" title="Random-access memory">RAM</a> to buffer your sample data, and since a 32-bit <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit" rel="wikipedia" title="Central processing unit">CPU</a> can address a maximum of 4 Gbytes, you probably need a 64-bit CPU and OS.  Your computer needs a fast, wide datapath to move huge amounts of data from disk to RAM quickly enough.  These requirements mean increased system expense and probable support headaches.  But WIVIs, unlike sample-based instruments, don&#8217;t move massive amounts of data from disk to RAM.  They&#8217;re able to run on much more modest computers, even many laptops.<br />
<br />
Sample-based VI plugins pre-load considerable sample data into RAM when they&#8217;re initialized.  You see this when start up your DAW &#8211; if you load a project with a large number of sampled VI plugins, you may have to wait up to several minutes before all plugins are ready and you can start working.  This doesn&#8217;t happen with WIVIs, since they pre-load relatively little data.  You get near-instant gratification.<br />
<br />
&#8220;But,&#8221; you say, &#8220;I&#8217;ve already invested in a big machine to run samples, and I just go for coffee when starting up my DAW.  So why should <span style="font-style: italic;">I</span> care?&#8221;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Achieving Realism</span><br />
I&#8217;ve already explained that the <span style="font-style: italic;">performance randomization</span> feature of each WIVI is crucial to the illusion of realism when WIVIs are combined into ensembles.  This is not only a matter of mimicking the imperfections of human players, but also counteracts adverse sonic effects that occur when combining sounds are too highly correlated, effects you <span style="font-style: italic;">don&#8217;t</span> hear when listening to real ensembles.  WIVI-style randomization may be the most important single factor in the ability of WIVIs to achieve realistic orchestral sound.<br />
<br />
But there&#8217;s much more.  Consider any wind instrument, for example.  With the real wind instrument, you know that when you blow harder, the sound gets louder but <span style="font-style: italic;">also </span>changes in timbre.  When playing expressively, it&#8217;s second nature for a musician to vary his or her instrument&#8217;s sound &#8211; in <span style="font-style: italic;">both </span>amplitude and timbre &#8211; within single notes, as well as from note to note.  Because WIVIs are based on a model that permits both amplitude and timbre to be varied at <span style="font-style: italic;">any </span>time, in response to breath pressure, they can reproduce this behavior and thereby lend themselves to achieving more natural-sounding playing.  Sample-based VIs don&#8217;t have this capability &#8211; you&#8217;re able to vary amplitude within a note (e.g., by varying CC11), but timbre doesn&#8217;t vary naturally along with it.  Likewise, whereas a WIVI models the way a real wind instrument&#8217;s pitch varies as a function of breath pressure, sample-based VIs cannot do so.  Vibrato?  WIVIs let you add that, as well, with continuous control over several pertinent parameters.  Breath noise, key noise, attack, release, and those all-important <span style="font-style: italic;">note transitions</span>?  Just about anything you&#8217;d like to be able to vary (or not vary), you can.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Whence Articulations?</span><br />
You&#8217;re probably used to seeing sample libraries that offer many different &#8220;articulations&#8221; for a given instrument.  That&#8217;s a big part of how they attempt to facilitate realism.  WIVIs aren&#8217;t set up that way, because with their inherent control capabilities you can <span style="font-style: italic;">create </span>just about any articulation you need.  In contrast, if a sample library doesn&#8217;t have the articulation you need, or the variant provided doesn&#8217;t sound right, you&#8217;re stuck.  Trills are a good example.  A typical sample library provides canned, half- and whole-step trills.  But you know trills can be played in different ways to enhance expression &#8211; imagine wanting to imitate the uneven fluttering of a butterfly.  WIVIs let you design your own trills, and each one can be unique if you&#8217;d like.  Same for any other articulation.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you want to speed your workflow, a WIVI lets you create your own library of <span style="font-style: italic;">re-usable</span> articulations, using what are called <span style="font-style: italic;">Smart Sequences</span>.  You can then set up a keyswitch to call up any articulation at any time, just as you can with many sample libraries.  Taking advantage of this and other WIVI flexibilities requires work and skill &#8211; but the point is: <span style="font-style: italic;">you can do it</span>.  That&#8217;s often <span style="font-style: italic;">not </span>true with sample libraries.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ensembles</span><br />
I haven&#8217;t mentioned the unique interactive interface you get when you purchase any WIVI instrument bundle (brass, woodwind, and sax bundles are currently available, with more planned).  Besides letting you adjust any WIVI parameter (many of which can also be set in real time via MIDI), the interface graphically depicts a performance space (such as a hall, studio, church, or anechoic chamber) in which you can place either a single WIVI instrument or an <span style="font-style: italic;">ensemble </span>of like or different instruments relative to an imaginary listener.  The position of each instrument relative to the listener establishes stereo pan, of course.  But since acoustics of the depicted performance space are modeled, too, position also affects the ratios of direct sound, early reflections, and late reflections, and therefore the depth of each player within the perceived acoustic space.  And if this reverberation implementation doesn&#8217;t suit your purposes, there is a way to bypass it and eliminate the pertinent computations, without losing the panning setup.  I&#8217;m doing this because I need to use my WIVIs along with sample-based VIs from other vendors and I want all these instruments to run through a common reverb setup.<br />
<br />
If you prefer, you can put each instrument instance in its own plugin.  But if you like to streamline your workflow by using instrument ensembles, you may find WIVI ensembles to be a great asset.  First, you can design your own polyphonic ensemble.  By comparison, sample libraries usually offer only a limited selection of ensembles.  Second, you can put an ensemble into a single plug-in instance if you like, which optimizes computational efficiency.  Each instrument can be assigned to a different MIDI channel for individual control (subject to the usual 16-channel limit), or they can all be assigned to the same channel, or anything in between.  Third, if several instruments are assigned to the <span style="font-style: italic;">same </span>MIDI channel, you can take advantage of Wallander&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">polyphonic mode</span> to automatically assign parts of chords to different instruments in the ensemble &#8211; potentially saving you a lot of work.  Controls in the interface allow you to specify the rules by which this is done.  Fantastic.<br />
<br />
If you&#8217;d like to see polyphonic mode and many other WIVI features in action, check out the <a href="http://www.wallanderinstruments.com/">Polyphonic Mode demo</a> on the Wallander home page.  Scroll down to the bottom of the page to find the demo.  For a more intimate experience that lets you try out <span style="font-style: italic;">all </span>of the WIVIs, I suggest the Wallander Instruments demo available at <a href="http://try-sound.com/">Try-Sound.com</a>.  And a free <a href="http://www.wallanderinstruments.com/?menu=products&amp;download_trial=1">WIVI Trial Edition</a>, downloadable from the Wallander site, includes the complete interactive environment and several (but not all) of the available WIVIs.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Scope of the WIVI Family</span><br />
What about the range of WIVI instruments available?  You&#8217;ve probably noticed I haven&#8217;t said anything about <span style="font-style: italic;">strings </span>so far.  That&#8217;s because there is no string product at the present time.  Wallander is well aware of this, and is known to be considering adding strings to the WIVI family.  Unfortunately, it seems doubtful that string WIVIs will appear soon, due to the complexity of the undertaking.  For now, I&#8217;m using sampled strings &#8211; and percussion instruments, for that matter &#8211; from other vendors.  They mix fine with my WIVIs, though I have to put up with the slow load times and realism disadvantages associated with sample libraries.<br />
<br />
Coverage of woodwinds is excellent, as 13 different types are available (in three bundles) with three or more variations of each.  In fact, in a project I&#8217;m working on, I needed an E-flat clarinet, for which a WIVI exists.  I own many sample libraries from one of the major vendors, but none of them offers this instrument.  Another major vendor&#8217;s sample library offers it, but the cost of adding it to my collection is high.  This was one of the factors that pushed me to try using WIVIs, and I&#8217;m very pleased with the result.  Similar situations exist with other &#8220;specialty&#8221; instruments.<br />
<br />
There are two WIVI saxophone bundles, covering 9 different sax types.  I don&#8217;t have these yet, so I can&#8217;t say much about them.<br />
<br />
Four WIVI brass instrument types are available at present, in the Brass 1 bundle.  However, if you take account of all the muted variations of the basic types, the WIVI Brass 1 bundle can actually be thought of as including 23 distinct instrument types.  Adding another bundle of brass instruments is said to be high in Wallander&#8217;s priorities.<br />
<br />
By the way, you can buy a <a href="http://www.sweetwater.com/store/search.php?s=WIVI&amp;go=Go%21"><span style="font-style: italic;">WIVI Epic Bundle</span></a> which includes <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> of the WIVIs currently available, at a large discount relative to the sum of the separate bundle prices.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WIVI in the School of Chops</span><br />
I&#8217;m putting my WIVIs, sample libraries, DAW, computer, and skills to the test with a large project:  sequencing Stravinsky&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">The Rite Of Spring</span>.  Great for my School of Chops objectives.  I&#8217;m reaching for the Holy Grail:  being able to have the entire orchestra running in one, unified environment (one computer running Cubase 5), with everything available to be edited at any time &#8211; i.e., no tracks frozen.  So far, so good.  At the moment, my orchestra incorporates 38 woodwind and brass WIVIs, as well as sampled strings.  I haven&#8217;t added percussion yet.  Although I have a 64-bit computer and OS (Vista Ultimate), I&#8217;ve found it advantageous to run the orchestra under the 32-bit version of Cubase 5.  This is because all presently-available WIVIs operate in 32-bit mode.  They also run under 64-bit Cubase 5, but then Steinberg&#8217;s <a href="http://knowledgebase.steinberg.net/262_1.html">VST Bridge</a> comes into play, creating significant overhead.  Fortunately, by using relatively little RAM, my WIVIs help keep the memory used by my 32-bit plugins below the 4 Gbyte limit.  Right now, until I add more plugins, I&#8217;m using about 25% or less of all eight of my CPU cores, and about 3.2 Gbytes of RAM out of 16 Gbytes available.  So there&#8217;s still headroom.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bottom Lines</span><br />
Of course, you want to know how my WIVIs <span style="font-style: italic;">sound</span>.  Overall, I&#8217;m very happy with them.  Most of the instruments sound <span style="font-style: italic;">very </span>good.  The jury is out regarding a few, which seem to sound more &#8220;breathy&#8221; and less resonant than I expect.  I&#8217;ve been working around this problem with EQ &#8211; but there are a <span style="font-style: italic;">lot </span>of WIVI parameters I haven&#8217;t mastered yet, and it may be that I can get closer to what I need by adjusting them.  WIVIs <span style="font-style: italic;">should </span>sound realistic, because the parameters of the model on which each one is based have been derived by automatic analysis of real instrument waveforms.  And Arne Wallander is a smart guy.<br />
<br />
Though I&#8217;ve focused on WIVIs in this article, my purpose has been to get you thinking about alternatives to sampling, with due recognition that there are worthy model-based products other than WIVIs on the market, and that sampling still has its place.<br />
<br />
There is probably a lot more to talk about, but I think it&#8217;s best to leave that for the comments I hope many of you readers will post.  I&#8217;ll join in as needed!<br />

We must be able to work quickly, and make the transition from inspiration-to-perspiration-to-production in the blink of an eye. Composers like to think of themselves as "lateral thinkers", but because of the time pressures involved we each can be as dogmatic as any specialist. It may start out as a new approach to solving a problem, but once we've found a unique way of getting things done, the tendency is to "box it in" and not budge from that successful path.<br /><br />Honestly, I find that tendency to be a bit unsettling. I'm always concerned about becoming too set in my ways, mainly because it runs contrary to the reason I became a composer in the first place. And, it can mean missing out on some great new opportunities, either in discovering a new creative outlet or in bringing greater efficiency to the studio. So I'm always on the lookout for little windows of time to "break the mold", which is not always easy. Then there are the times when the opportunity presents itself in the form of a last-minute project - and the choice is either to a) back off and recommend the gig to someone else, or b) jump in with both feet. The anecdote below is a case study in lateral thinking in the studio.<br /><br />It all started when I got a call from a production company I'd worked with on a previous project. That first gig was to create music and sound design for the pilot of a web series. This call was about a trailer for this year's Comic Con - for a new animated series they had been developing. It turned out that they didn't have the right clearances to the music that was used to edit the reel sequence. So now they needed to re-bed the trailer with new music - but didn't have time to re-cut the reel to synchronize it to the "hits". Having the ability to replace a temp reel with original music that hits all of the cuts is part of the film composer's stock-in-trade, but this particular project had to be completed in a matter of hours - including new sound design and a mix that was hot enough to cut through the din of a convention show floor. So the solution was to take a handful of cleared scores and composite them in a way that made it seem like the music was designed to go with the timing of the reel. My job was to connect those various elements into a seamless whole - in a few hours.<br /><br />Fortunately, the music they provided covered the right kind of ground for the reel. I was handed three scores that were owned by the major movie studio that was assembling the master reel (a reel with multiple trailers/teasers) for the Con. One soundtrack was from a horror movie, another from a suspense thriller with a romantic element, and the third was from a straight-up action movie. Because I had one-off CDs provided by the studio, I had more cues than were released on the commercial soundtracks. This was a *really* good thing, since I wanted to use something that wasn't immediately recognizable, and those secondary cues had the same "vibe" without being the showcase tunes that can be heard needle-dropped into every other movie trailer you see on TV. I started by skinning all of the soundtrack CDs to the project folder, then successively auditioning each cue. I used the "Sound Browser" in Nuendo that not only allowed me to rapidly move down the list of each cue - but it also displayed a peak waveform file of each cue as it was selected for preview. This meant that longer cues could be visually inspected and quickly sampled by clicking on the time line where things 'got interesting'. This allowed me to move through the tracks more quickly than sitting and listening to each one end-to-end (or worse yet, listening to the first ten seconds and then skipping to the next cue, only to miss something really cool/useful at 0:11). I tagged up the files using the "rating" meta-tag in Nuendo and then sorted the selected cue by rating - then dragged that sub-set of cues into the project.<br /><br />The reel itself goes from a "sense of wonder" vibe to an "eerie" vibe, and then into full-on "Danger! Danger!" mode before tailing off with a "Coming Soon" card on a fade. There were definitely some "hits" in the reel that I wanted to match up to, and the original temp score highlighted some of that. It was at this point that I started to think "Ya know, it would be faster and easier if I tossed these cues and just wrote this myself, end-to-end." And quite frankly, I might have attempted it if I didn't also have to re-build the sound design (for animation, that's no small feat) and complete a fairly hot mix in a few hours. There were obstacles to overcome regardless of the choice I made. The obvious problems I saw with the new temp cues were in tempo and key matching. As an example: there was a place in the reel where the obvious choice was to drop in a big orchestral hit with a bowed gong (from the horror score), but it didn't blend seamlessly with a suspense cue (from the action movie) that it dovetailed into. The tail on the hit was too long, and the suspense cue as in the wrong key. It was too late to write something for that spot myself, and the choice was to go digging through the full set of temp cues *again* (almost as time-consuming as re-scoring the scene) or work with the clips I had in front of me. This is where the 'lateral thinking' came in.<br /><br />I opted to try some of the pitch and time shifting features in Nuendo - something I've rarely used up to this point - definitely *not* part of my standard template. It seemed like a big dice-roll, since any other time I've done pitch or time-shifting to broad spectrum (i.e. full mix) material the results have always been wanting. But, people have been raving about the new MPEX 3 algorithms (licensed to Steinberg from Prosoniq) so i decided to give it a try. The end result was really great - and a huge relief once I knew I had something that could make the project work. In certain cases, it made more sense to shift a cue to a key related to but *not* matching to the the previous segment - sometimes to keep the shift interval smaller, and in other cases because it simply seemed to work better in context. There were also several tiny little timing shifts inside the cues *without* changing pitch. Having the ability to put ever-so-slight shifts on hits in the middle of a cue allowed things to really lock up with the action on-screen, and the resulting processing didn't seem to alter the quality of music. Once the 'new' temp music bed was in place, I put together the sound design and then finished the mix in the remaining hour.<br /><br />The end result was a "score" that wasn't too heavily dependent on any one of the three soundtracks I was given. This gave the teaser a feel of having its own vibe - and being able to match the tempo of the music to the action on-screen really helped. There's a stark difference in tone between the "ahh" and "eek" moments - definitely more than I would have done if I had scored it myself. But it really works for this animation piece - and the client was happy with it, which of course is the ultimate goal.<br /><br />With this experience, I go back and think about how I might have done things differently - in particular how I *might* have scored the trailer if I had the time. I'm feeling the influence of the newly assembled temp score - which ended up being quite a departure from the first temp track. I went back to the original music bed - and it seemed strangely odd and plain compared to the composite I had assembled. Because of the material I was given (and that sub-set I had selected) limited my choices, there were some musical elements - particularly some of the key relations in some sequences - that I was 'forced into' that now seem right, and for the lack of a better word - 'natural'. Likewise, I've grown much more comfortable with a set of tools that have gone unused in my studio up to now. I've had friends talk to me about using pitch and time shifting tools to re-edit their own music cues after the editor or director makes a late change in a film, but I've always mistrusted what that processing does to a finished mix. Now I feel more confident that it can be relied upon for mission-critical use when time on a project is running out.<br /><br />So this accidental exercise in lateral thinking has been beneficial in two ways: 1) I'll know now to broaden my options on harmonic rhythm when creating a high-energy cue, and 2) there's a "new" tool in the kit that I've learned to trust when the sand is dropping through the hourglass. The icing on the cake is that the production company is talking to me about other projects, albeit with a more realistic time-line. So now it's time to get back to work, but I think I'll make some extra time this weekend to dust off some of the other features in my sequencer that have gone unused for too long - you never know when you'll need it.<br /><br />________________<br /><span style="font-size:100%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">HOUSTON HAYNES</span></span><span style="font-size:100%;"> <span style="font-style: italic;">was born an raised in the southeastern United States, and moved to Los Angeles in 2003 to pursue a career as a composer</span><span style="font-style: italic;">. </span></span><span style="font-size:100%;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> You can find his SCORECast bio (and links to his other sites) <a href="2009/05/houston-haynes.html">here</a>.</span></span><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></div>

I hope you enjoy this as I still think about the few weeks I worked with one of my heroes.</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">This was an article in a series from my 'secret' blog which passed away a few years ago.</span><br />
<br />
We were working at Paramount Stage M - which, sadly, closed a couple of years ago. The film was &#8220;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi33227033/">The Story Of Us</a>&#8221;. In the control booth <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFEBeMFuL_M">Rob Reiner</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvHuHIPe-o">Marc Shaiman</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0102341/">Tim Boyle</a>, and crew listened to various takes that had been recorded.  There was a lot of film music history recorded on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xmhtUXTPMo">Stage M</a>. &#8220;Star Trek&#8221;, &#8220;Psycho&#8221;, &#8220;Sunset Boulevard&#8221;, &#8220;Out of Africa&#8221; and hundreds more.<br />
<br />
Sitting in the corner of the room with his guitar, Clapton was playing along with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXnchu1xDU">takes</a> or playing whatever came to mind. I was sitting about three feet away talking to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0832790/">Jeff Stott</a>, one of Reiner&#8217;s long time producers. The thought that Clapton was three feet away and quietly picking a tune while we we carrying on business seemed like a dream that you didn&#8217;t want to wake up from.<br />
<br />
Clapton, never seemed to be without his guitar. He loves playing. For the several weeks leading up to that recording session we had talked a bit about guitars and, as starry eyed as I was about him, I did get him to sign my guitar tuner after he used it on the stage. Anyway I found myself staring at a chord progression he was working on - which felt kind of like stealing glances at a woman&#8217;s low cut blouse. Clapton stopped and looked at me. &#8220;Hey, you know of a good <a href="http://www.guitarrasramirez.com/english/inicioEn.html">Ramirez</a> guitar?&#8221;<br />
<br />
"Don't you have some dude who buys guitars for you?" I ask with a sarcastic and incredulous tone.<br />
<br />
He ignored my sarcasm and repeated the question. As it happened, I was in the <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Center" rel="wikipedia" title="Guitar Center">Guitar Center</a> in Sherman Oaks a few weeks earlier and noticed two beauty Ramirez guitars in their back room. That&#8217;s the room I think of as guitar heaven, where they hang the exceptional acoustic guitars. Martins, Guilds, Gibsons and so on. I told Clapton, "Actually I saw a two at the Guitar Center."<br />
<br />
Clapton asked me to call and see if they would bring them out to him. So I found myself brokering guitars for Clapton. I called GC and asked them if they still had the Ramirez guitars I had seen. They said yes. One was 8k or so and the other about the same. (A vintage Ramirez can run into the 100k range. The Ramirez was the guitar played by <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9s_Segovia" rel="wikipedia" title="Andrés Segovia">Andres Segovia</a>.) I told them I&#8217;d call back.<br />
<br />
I asked Eric, "You ok if I use your name with the Guitar Center?"<br />
<br />
"Sure," He said. I called them back and asked for the manager.<br />
<br />
"Um, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002008/" rel="imdb" title="Eric Clapton">Eric Clapton</a> is interested in those Ramirez guitars, can you bring them to Paramount Stage M?"<br />
<br />
"Gee, I dunno. We're not allowed to bring stuff out of the store"<br />
<br />
I said, "Guitar Center. Eric Clapton. Get it?"<br />
<br />
"I dunno. Store policy we can&#8217;t take a guitar out of the store."<br />
<br />
I repeated ""Guitar Center. Eric Clapton."<br />
<br />
He said "Yeah, Yeah, I get it. Hold on, I have to check with my boss."<br />
<br />
After the GC store manager put me on hold I found myself getting righteously indignant - Son of a bitch, it's Clapton!<br />
<br />
You see, after a couple of weeks hanging with EC you grow to love and respect him. Besides the charisma, talent, and history there's something about him that radiates a genuine calming effect. It's not that he walks around like the Zen Master <a href="http://www.plumvillage.org/">Thich Nhat Hanh</a> - He just seems to live for the moment in a way I haven't seen other celebs act. It's hard to describe without sounding like idol worship. There are people who can make you feel comfortable in such a way that it brings out your own best self. That's the closest I can describe to what it was like to hang with Clapton.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of agents and producers who have this talent of making you feel very important while you are with them, but in the end you know that they were doing their manipulative thing to get the best work from you. No matter. Clapton was none of that. And that is why I became so indignant when I was put on hold.<br />
<br />
The manager finally returned and said, &#8220;Okay. We got permission. Just one thing. How is Mister Clapton going to pay?&#8221;<br />
<br />
I put the manager on hold. I tell my friend Nick Vidar, "They want to know how he's gonna pay?"<br />
<br />
Nick says, "You can't ask Clapton that!"<br />
<br />
I said, "Well I'm not paying!"<br />
<br />
We both had a laugh over the ridiculousness of it all. I walked around to Clapton and, with some embarrassment, ask "Um, Eric. The Guitar Center wants to know how you'll pay for the guitars"<br />
<br />
"Like all rock-stars, with a credit card," He smiled.<br />
<br />
Later that afternoon two guys from the Guitar Center showed up with two Ramirez guitars. One announced himself as the store manager and the other - well - maybe he was there just in case someone was going to run off with the guitars. Paramount, like any major studio is like a prison: High walls, and security everywhere. There's no escaping the lot without 20 guards chasing after you. These days the studio lots are probably more difficult to enter than a military base.<br />
<br />
Eric was recording on the main stage, so I asked the GC guys to hang in the producers booth. The room is large and was used for solos but mostly the orchestra contractor would sit on the phone juggling schedules. Or if things were going badly on a recording date the producer might have a meeting with the director. (Not so on the Clapton recordings.)<br />
<br />
I walked out onto the main stage and told Clapton the GC guys were there with the guitars. He said he'd look at them on a break. I don't think the word 'break' occurs to him as something he needs to do. When he was on break he would have a guitar in hand and be running a tune or blues riff or noodling away as only Clapton could.<br />
<br />
So - on break - he meets the GC guys and starts playing the guitars. As it happens <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqNFPB3bNpw">Christopher Guest</a> was there because Rob Reiner invited him to the stage to meet Clapton, who is  a HUGE fan of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZbHagBNY98">Spinal Tap</a>. In fact he would often quote from the film. And Chris Guest is an accomplished musician. (Plus one of my favorite film makers.) Chris Guest is a quiet man, but you sense there's the hum of a supercomputer taking everything in. He's stealth funny. He can, I'm told, imitate odd sounds like squeaks or insects. I don&#8217;t know, but that&#8217;s what I was told.<br />
<br />
Anyway while Clapton is deciding on which guitar to buy, Guest has reprised the role of Nigel Tufnel. Only he's very subtle about it. In fact I don't think the GC manager or his sidekick even recognized Guest - who as Nigel is now quizzing the GC manager about the Ramirez, and its history.<br />
<br />
In his Nigel accent, &#8220;Is it true Segovia played this very guitar?&#8221; Of course we insiders recognize Nigel Tufnel. Clapton is trying to keep a straight face, but the GC manager has no idea. It&#8217;s as if he&#8217;s in the middle of a <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0056187/" rel="imdb" title="Sacha Baron Cohen">Sasha Baron Cohen</a> routine. After a minute or two of questions Guest (as Nigel) asks the GC manager if they can put a pickup and a tremolo bar on the face of the Ramirez.<br />
<br />
"You know maybe drill a few holes in the face here. Mount a whammy bar. That would make a very nice guitar", says Nigel to the stunned GC manager.<br />
<br />
It was an awesome moment in film history for me.<br />

<div id='summary474921364636980196'><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SpFMX1WbqLI/AAAAAAAAAlE/w7FHn7rMgyc/s1600-h/olszewski-diystudio.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SpFMX1WbqLI/AAAAAAAAAlE/w7FHn7rMgyc/s320/olszewski-diystudio.png" /></a></div>As this month&#8217;s SCOREcast theme is &#8220;Workflow&#8221;, I started thinking of the DIY STUDIO article in terms of how you may customize or optimize your system for top performance. I made some notes on RAM, hard drive speed / size / partitioning, CPU, and so on, but it degenerated into a technical soup of gear talk. And considering the purpose of DIY STUDIO is low-cost studio startups, everything I had written about required money. Neither of these is what I wanted to talk about this month.<br />
<div><br />
Instead, I&#8217;m focusing this DIY STUDIO article on <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergonomics" rel="wikipedia" title="Ergonomics">ergonomics</a>. The word &#8220;ergonomics&#8221; derives from two Greek words: <em>Ergon</em>, meaning work, and <em>Nomos</em>, meaning &#8220;natural laws&#8221;. In short, ergonomics is the study and design of machinery and equipment people use to perform work. In addition to special keyboards, mice, and chairs that immediate come to mind when thinking ergonomics, in many cases there are several free or low-cost things you can do to improve the ergonomics of your studio. Also, I won&#8217;t get too deep into the details, but hopefully the comments and conversation in addition to the article itself will provide some great ideas.<br />
<br />
First is <strong>equipment</strong>, including desks, chairs, mice, placement / orientation of equipment, and lighting. If you&#8217;re like me, you have some pretty standard office furniture for your studio. My opinion of one of the best investments you can make in your studio, after your music production equipment itself, is to get some office equipment and furniture that maximizes your comfort and minimizes the distances your arms, feet, and fingers have to move. In my own workflow, I personally find myself often doing this particular combination of right-clicking my mouse, moving down a popup menu, and selecting an item. I also do some very precise dragging with my mouse, which is probably not as efficient as it could be. I&#8217;ve found as many keyboard shortcuts as possible, but some things are just easier to <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_%28computing%29" rel="wikipedia" title="Mouse (computing)">right click</a>- maybe because my hand is already on the mouse or something. If you&#8217;re in a similar situation, consider a trackball mouse that minimizes your wrist rotation and repetitive movement. Next consider a height-adjustable desk or table for your work surface. In SCOREcast podcast #16, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1676420/" rel="imdb" title="Deane Ogden">Deane Ogden</a> went into great detail about his own desk. It&#8217;s awesome information; if you haven&#8217;t checked it out, you should. A good chair is also important for those all-nighter scoring sessions. I&#8217;ve found that finding a good chair is a pretty subjective thing; so if you have the opportunity, visit a place that specializes in chairs, such as <a href="http://www.relaxtheback.com/">Relax The Back</a>. Be aware though, you&#8217;ll pay good money for a good chair. Personally, I&#8217;m holding off on the chair for a while.<br />
<br />
Didn&#8217;t I say &#8220;free and low-cost&#8221; solutions? Okay, enough about equipment. Second major topic is <strong>angles</strong>. Specifically, having correct angles in your workspace can greatly reduce fatigue and improve efficiency. Some important angles to check:<br />
<ul><li>Eyes: your monitor should be directly in front of your eyes, or slightly below, when your neck is straight and looking straight ahead.</li>
<li>Body: Your arms should fall naturally to the armrests, with your elbows bending slightly more than 90 degrees. Thighs should be parallel to the floor. Like elbows, knees should bend slightly more than 90 degrees (more like 100 degrees). Your wrists should be straight, placing your hands on your keyboard. In a music composition context, some people prefer to have the computer keyboard at this height and your synth or <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI_controller" rel="wikipedia" title="MIDI controller">MIDI controller</a> keyboard slightly higher; some prefer the opposite.</li>
<li>Reach: Try this experiment: Sit normally at your workstation, and without leaning forward or stretching, try to reach everything you&#8217;d need to do your work. If you cannot reach mostly everything (and definitely the most important stuff), then you may consider changing your setup so all the equipment you need is well within reach, without leaning.</li>
<li>Chair: Your chair should support all of the above, and should also provide support for your back from your pelvis to your shoulder blades. Your chair should be adjustable to accommodate for any angles you may need.</li>
</ul><br />
One thing to keep in mind when adjusting the angles of your workstation, it may not feel &#8220;natural&#8221; at first. This may be because your body had become accustomed to slumping or something similar. Give it a chance to grow on you and you may find you&#8217;re able to work better, longer. But do pay attention to the aches and pains you experience, as this may be a signal that you should tweak something else.<br />
<br />
Third major topic: <strong>repetition</strong>. Although probably necessary to an extent, repetitive motion is the enemy. Try to arrange your workspace that eliminates repetitive motion as much as possible. Do this by paying attention to what your hands, eyes, arms, and the rest of your body is doing as you work. If you find you repeat particular movements more than others, come up with alternatives. For example, in my mouse-clicking example, I may want to look up some more keyboard shortcuts, or even map some custom shortcuts, then alternate between mouse commands and shortcuts. If you cannot find a way to eliminate repetition, a good rule of thumb is circles are better for you than straight lines. Try to lay out your tasks or parts of your workflow in some circular fashion, to reduce muscle and ligament fatigue.<br />
<br />
This article is just some general guidance, but hopefully it&#8217;ll get you started. There are plenty of other resources for more information. Here are some good &#8220;Googling&#8221; terms:<br />

<b><br />
</b><br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">I've heard it said of several composers (respectfully) that they're a machine. They're capable of doing long hours and just hanging in there at the keyboard, making music non-stop until&#8230; the end of the world, presumably.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">On the other hand, it's common to hear other composing studios disrespected for churning out a lot of music: "That place? Yeah. It's just a machine." Read: soulless, money-oriented, and full of mean-spirited gamesmanship and dirty politics.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">Help me unpack the baggage and get to some new ideas here. What does this provocation bring to mind for you? Would there be an advantage to being an <i>actual</i> composing robot? What would such a thing look like? Is there a process we can undergo to get there?</span></span><br />

You can learn from our mistakes/successes. Several of us have been at this for some time, and so it's only natural that we've learned certain "tricks of the trade" or "secrets", if you will, and we are now able to pass them on in hopes that you don't have to learn them the hard way as we once did. My aim for this Site is that you will never again have to "pay" for the knowledge that someone who has gone before you could just as easily spend 5 minutes telling you about from first-hand experience.<br />
<br />
Having worked along side composers like <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001877/" rel="imdb" title="Hans Zimmer">Hans Zimmer</a>, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006251/" rel="imdb" title="Graeme Revell">Graeme Revell</a>, and more recently <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0413011/">Steve Jablonski</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0340003/">Rupert Gregson-Williams</a>, and SCOREcast founder <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1676420/">Deane Ogden</a>, I've gleaned much by watching how the big boys do it. One thing I've noticed about the really successful composers &#8212; They are all <span style="font-style: italic;">healthy</span>. Hans Zimmer rarely gets sick. If he does, it is the kind of sick that is over in a day, and I've never seen it cost him anything in terms of down time. Same with my current composer, Deane Ogden. Deane is a machine (which you know if you follow his status updates!). When Deane first hired me, one of the first things he told me was to "stay healthy. We are no good to each other if we are on our backs."<br />
<br />
How do you stay healthy in the studio? It is possible, and most of it has to do with what we are talking about this month: Workflow. Even though you are sitting for the majority of it, life in the studio can be back-breaking work. Any environment where you are spending 14+ hours a day needs to be set up in a way that accomodates a relaxing workflow... one that helps, not hinders.<br />
<br />
I've spent an incredible amount of carefully thought out time and energy planning and conceptualizing my studio layout for one reason: I don't want to get hurt. I have worked in some very nice situations in this town as a scoring assistant, witnessing first-hand the most comfortable studios that money can buy along with some of the most poorly laid out studios one could imagine. I know guys that have horrible back problems that stem from sitting in cheap chairs for days. I have seen many composers have to start wearing glasses because of the activity of assailing their eyesight with poorly color-calibrated monitors while trying to get music written. Orchestrator Susie Benchasil said in a SCOREcast <a href="2009/05/scorecast-no19-shownotes.html">interview</a> once that she knows a lot of people in the business that have issues of poor circulation due to simply not moving their legs enough and sitting on their posteriors for days at a time with little to no physical activity happening. Composing, it seems, can be hazardous to your health, so it's no surprise that any composer worth his or her salt will tell you that <span style="font-style: italic;">health</span> is of optimum concern in the studio. In fact, at my old stomping grounds of Remote Control, a mandate was handed down by the Lion King himself that every composer use the same brand of desk. Hans believed that a particular desk from a particular company kept back fatigue to a minimum, so everyone was supplied with one, whether they liked it or not.<br />
<br />
I spend a lot of time watching how pro composers do things when I get invited into their "inner sanctums". That is a rare treat and I never want to squander the opportunity. Since not having to re-invent the wheel is priceless knowledge to have, I'll attempt to outline a few of the things that I've picked up along the way. It might take me a few posts to get in everything that I want to, but I'll get it done. We'll call this the first in a series for this month from me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Musical Chairs<br />
</span>In our studio, Deane and I listen to a lot of podcasts. When we are wiring, assembling demos, or some other menial task that doesn't require us speaking to each other for lengths at a time, we listen to what others are doing in various fields and try to apply those new ideas to our own craft, if applicable. We recently heard <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King" rel="wikipedia" title="Stephen King">Stephen King</a> say that he likens "writing in your studio to 'creative sleep'." What he meant by that is this: Everything in your bedroom is engineered to help you fall asleep so you can dream. It's dark, the doors are locked, and the temperature is right. The pillows are the perfect softness, and comforter is just the right thickness, and the bed doesn't have any lumps in it. Your studio should be the same way. When you close the door to your writing space, you should now be completely free of any discomforts so that you may "dream" the right score for the film.<br />
<br />
The cornerstone to making this happen is the chair you are sitting in. You are in your chair for up to 14 hours a day, so you need to have one that is not good, but <span style="font-style: italic;">great</span>. Your task chair is not something you want to be cheap about, believe me. It is one of those things where you are either going to pay now, or pay later. But you <span style="font-style: italic;">will</span> pay. (Preferably in the form of dollars to a place that sells chairs and not dollars to a chiropractor!)<br />
<br />
Your chair should be first of all, sturdy. These chairs that you see at places like Staples and Office Depot &#8212; those aren't going to work. In the office furniture business, there is a lingo... much like what we have as composers. There are chairs that are specifically designed for "tasking", and this is a paraphrase, but it basically means "jobs that are done while hunched over a workstation desk". That's us! When searching for the right chair for your studio, you want to be looking specifically for a "task chair".<br />
<br />
My advice would be to look at two "task chair" companies: Steel Case and Herman Miller.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/global">Herman Miller</a> is what Deane and Lee both use in their studios. At Deane's place, we have a couple of Herman Miller <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/Products/Aeron-Chairs">Aeron Chairs</a>. These chairs are the bomb. <br />
<div class="zemanta-img zemanta-action-dragged" style="display: block; float: right; margin: 1em; width: 310px;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Aeron_chair_JN.jpg"><img alt="Aeron chair" height="321" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ec/Aeron_chair_JN.jpg/300px-Aeron_chair_JN.jpg" style="border: medium none; display: block;" width="300" /></a>Image via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Aeron_chair_JN.jpg">Wikipedia</a></div>They are a little expensive, but again, you cannot skimp on this part of your studio. Remember what I said: You'll either pay the price now or pay the price later. Your choice. Aeron Chairs are completely adjustable and come in several different sizes. They also have one of the best warrantes in the business and Herman Millr is a trusted name in seating and has been for decades. This is not some fly-by-night mom-and-pop that will be gone tomorrow. HM chairs are everywhere &#8212; even <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump" rel="wikipedia" title="Donald Trump">Donald Trump</a> sits in one!<br />
<br />
Herman Miller also makes a chair called the <a href="http://www.ultimatebackstore.com/product-exec/product_id/351/pn/Celle_Chair_-_Quick_Ship">Celle Chair</a>. Celle Chairs are less expensive than the Aeron Chair, but provide many of the same features such as adjustable lumbar support and adjustable armrests. The major difference between the two is that the Celle lacks the <span style="font-style: italic;">total</span> adjustability that the Aeron Chair is famous for, but if you don't need that or you are fairly average sized, the Celle will work great for you. Plus, it is considerably less money &#8212; about $400 for a brand new Celle Chair.<br />
<br />
I get Deane's HM chairs from a company in Chicago called The Ultimate Back Store. These guys often have great deals on HM products and sometimes even have floor models they'll sell for less, but still have the same warranty as a brand new one. They also will ship the chair for free and have service centers that will come to your studio and fix the chair should anything ever break or go wrong. (When does THAT happen ever?)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Herman Miller Task Chairs</span><br />
Fully adjustable, comes in various sizes to fit your body type, 12-year "no-fault" warranty<br />
Price range: $400 USD (Celle) -$700 USD (Aeron)<br />
<a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/global">Herman Miller.com</a><br />
<a href="http://www.ultimatebackstore.com/">The Ultimate Back Store</a><br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.steelcase.com/">Steel Case</a> is also another company that makes amazing task chairs. Their <a href="http://www.steelcase.com/na/leap_products.aspx?f=11852">Leap Chair</a> is a favorite at several studios I've worked in like Capitol Records and the Power Station in New York (which is wh<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fZp_xxfyktg/SlTTHGpP-OI/AAAAAAAAABo/E4AFclokJRw/s1600-h/steelcase.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5356137975846533346" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fZp_xxfyktg/SlTTHGpP-OI/AAAAAAAAABo/E4AFclokJRw/s320/steelcase.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 203px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 203px;" /></a>ere I first sat in one). They are a little more expensive than the Herman Miller Aeron Chair, coming in at around $850, but they are well worth the money and come with a full lifetime warranty.<br />
<br />
Steel Case also makes a handful of other models that sport several other configurations to accomodate both your price range and feature set requirements. I would suggest checking out their company website to see what they have to offer. The Ultimate Back Store also carries Steel Case, and as the Herman Miller stuff, they regularly offer floor models for sale at heavy discounts. The best thing to do with UBS is call them and talk to a human being. They are great to deal with.<br />
<br />
Steel Case is a great alternative to Herman Miller on many levels, especially price.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Steel Case Task Chairs</span><br />
Fully to semi-adjustable, comes in various sizes to fit your body type, limited lifetime warranty<br />
Price range: $300 USD (Uno) - $900 USD (Leap)<br />

<a href="http://www.ultimatebackstore.com/file_include-exec/file/steelcase?hs340=leftnav_steelcase">The Ultimate Back Store</a><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, obviously there a hundred different ways to go with a task chair, and these are only two of my favorites. Of course your studio has certain requirements that we don't have in Deane's studio &#8212; every space is different. Maybe you turn to the side to play your keyboard controller or perhaps it is centered under your desk in front of you. Maybe you use an outboard mixing console, so you need to be able to "Alex Keaton" your way across the room and roll to where your outboard rig is set up.<br />
<br />
Whatever the case, your chair is the epicenter of your whirlwind. It has to be great, not just <span style="font-style: italic;">good</span>. It will be the one piece of gear that sustains you over time and keeps you from pain.<br />
<br />
Do your homework. Research the hell out of chairs. My next post will be about that fancy desk that Hans wants you to get!  <br />

Regardless, I&#8217;d like to take some time focusing on the use of an analog synthesizer in your studio.<br />
<br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;TOUCHABLE&#8221; SOUND</span><br />
<div class="MsoNormal">If most young composers are like me, they&#8217;ve spent the majority of their musical lives in the digital world, staring at a computer monitor and pushing virtual buttons and moving pixelated sliders to create music.  And while this is all fine and dandy, many young composers have little hands on experience with electronic instruments.  Even if they have, it&#8217;s usually with modern digital synthesizers consisting of nested menus, a few buttons, and a couple of knobs.</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">Some time ago a friend leant me an analog synthesizer- a monophonic one to be precise, a Korg MS-10.  This means I could play only one note at a time, which seemed quite absurd to me!  But this simplicity is what I needed to understand the basics of synthesis.  Every  parameter of sound was at my fingertips, from the oscillator to the filter to the VCA.</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">And if the last sentence sounds like Greek, don&#8217;t worry (see the links to basic synthesis tutorials at the bottom of this post)- the fact is I had no idea what those things were when I started!  But all of those parameters of sound were assigned to a knob that I could <i>TOUCH!</i>  Goodness gracious, I could actually move a big switch and make the sound change!  Maybe I am sounding like a huge dork, but this was a fantastic sensation to someone who had no prior experience with electronic music hardware other than a computer screen.  I could physically move a knob an inch or two and hear a dramatic change in sound</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">Over the next several hours (and weeks and months&#8230;) to come I learned what all these parameters actually did to sound and began to understand how to actually make music (rather than bleeps and bloops) using analog synthesizers.</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">All of this had a pleasant side effect- because I now that I understood how to control sound at this very basic level (using filters, envelopes, oscillators, etc.), I could apply this knowledge to my virtual instrument plug-ins, samples, and even to acoustic instruments.  I was now in control of the sound coming out of my studio far more so than if I had never touched an analog synthesizer.  My orchestral mockups were more convincing, my electronic sounds were more expressive, and I was able to make my loops sound unlike anyone else&#8217;s with a few minutes of extra programming.</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">The funny thing is that even though I studied electronic music in college (several classes at a conservatory nonetheless!) it took an analog synthesizer from the 1970s for me to <i>finally</i> understand the basic physics of sound.</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">THAT &#8220;ANALOG&#8221; SOUND</span></div><div class="MsoNormal">I&#8217;m going to stay away from the whole &#8216;analog&#8217; vs. &#8216;digital&#8217; debate and which sounds better.  We could argue until the cows come home.  But the fact remains- analog synthesizers create sounds using chips powered by electrical transformers.  That makes it different from the 0&#8217;s and 1&#8217;s of the digital world.</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">Anyone can operate in the digital world- I&#8217;ve heard convincing music created by novices in Garageband.  But in this new world of digital access (and excess&#8230;) where anyone with a computer can upload an original composition to iTunes, how can you separate yourself from the next composer?</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">If I had a master list of answers, I would be living in a large house on Venice beach and summering in the sound of France right now.  But what I can say is that it takes skill and talent to program analog synthesizers, and the depth they can add to a track is dramatic.  It can be another tool in your arsenal, contributing to the &#8220;je ne sais quoi&#8221; of originality.</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">NEXT TIME: KEEPING IT &#8216;REAL&#8217; &#8211; ADVANCED MOCKUP TECHNIQUES</span></div><div class="MsoNormal">In the next column I&#8217;ll highlight some specific techniques I&#8217;ve learned from analog synthesis as well as a slew of other mockup techniques to help your digital music sound more like performed music!</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">LINKS TO BASIC SYNTH TUTORIALS</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.mutantaudio.net/tutorials/basic_synthesis_tutorial_part1/index.html">http://www.mutantaudio.net/tutorials/basic_synthesis_tutorial_part1/index.html</a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.fortunecity.com/emachines/e11/86/synth1.html">http://www.fortunecity.com/emachines/e11/86/synth1.html</a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.innovativesynthesis.com/basic-synthesis-part-1-%E2%80%93-oscillators/">http://www.innovativesynthesis.com/basic-synthesis-part-1-&#8211;-oscillators/</a></div></div>

Yes, I had the ubiquitous STAR WARS (1977) experience almost identical to Lee's and a host of others of my generation. My parents' album, which I listened to as a young boy, is still hanging on the wall of my studio which I occasionally will get down and listen to. Other scores like PATTON (1970), VERTIGO (1958), EMPIRE OF THE SUN (1987), and JURASSIC PARK (1993), just to name a few were all responsible for sprouting their own branches on my tree of film music adoration.<br /><br />However influential those listening experiences were for me as a child, none of them would be the score I would pick as being <span style="font-style: italic;">the</span> score which made me want to devote my entire life to the craft.<br /><br />That designation is reserved exclusively for <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000384/" title="Danny Elfman" rel="imdb">Danny Elfman</a>'s modern classic <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099487/" title="Edward Scissorhands" rel="imdb">EDWARD SCISSORHANDS</a> (1990).<br /><br />I was in high school at the time and had, throughout my life, developed a rich passion for both movies and music. As a band nerd since fifth grade playing the tenor saxophone, creating melodies on my horn was always more interesting to me than playing those written by others. I had deep down inside a desire to compose but I never knew what that meant or what I would do to satiate such desires. I wasn't sure what I wanted to write or what I wanted to express.<br /><br />Then I saw EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and a light bulb went off. Actually it was more like two speeding locomotives, one representing my love of movies, the other my love for music, had collided with such force that the resulting fusion impacted the course of my life forever.<br /><br />I realized that <span style="font-style: italic;">this</span> is the kind of music I wanted to write. <span style="font-style: italic;">This</span> was how I wanted to express myself. The thought of sitting in a darkened theater responsible for breathing life into the dead corpse of an unscored film thrilled me beyond anything I had comprehended before. All the pieces of the puzzle fell into place and life suddenly become a lot clearer.<br /><br />As for Danny Elfman's magnum opus itself, it remains one of my very favorite scores to date. So much of it achieves a level of perfection not easily attained in the film scoring community. The marriage of Elfman's score and Tim Burton's story and pictures is one thought only to exist in fairy tales.   <div style="margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;" class="zemanta-pixie"><a class="zemanta-pixie-a" href="http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/fb154c0b-685c-4080-94ea-74ea5dc30291/" title="Reblog this post [with Zemanta]"><img style="border: medium none ; float: right;" class="zemanta-pixie-img" src="http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=fb154c0b-685c-4080-94ea-74ea5dc30291" alt="Reblog this post [with Zemanta]" /></a><span class="zem-script more-related pretty-attribution"><script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js" defer="defer"></script></span></div><br /><br /><center><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/8OEJhgonx4Q&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/8OEJhgonx4Q&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="344" width="425"></embed></object></center></div>

You are going to see numerous articles on the subject, ranging from workflow in the studio and the scoring stage to workflow in business and in dealing with the other personalities of this business.<br />
<br />
This post is the first in a three-part series about when, how, and why you should hire an assistant to help you in your studio or in your business as a composer. But let's make a deal first: I want this to be an open dialog with you guys, not a one-sided conversation from me on what I think you ought to do. Deal? Okay, cool.<br />
<br />
Periodically, I get an email or a <a href="http://twitter.com/deaneogdenmusic">Tweet</a> about what I think on this subject, so I thought it would be appropriate to address it here and start the conversation with you. I will start by telling you that most of my smooth "workflow" as a busy composer is in place simply because I have help. Not all the time, but certainly <span style="font-style: italic;">some-of-the-time</span> composing for picture is a team sport. I have a solid team that I work with on virtually every picture to ensure that things go smoothly and there are no surprises. I try to hire the same score recordist and mixers, the same contractors, copyists, orchestrators, and studio assistants on each project so that I do not have to train and retrain people to the way that I like to work. My people know my process and I know theirs. It's easy, it's functional, and we work well together, often anticipating what each other is thinking. When we've conquered, we also party together afterward and celebrate our victory as a team. Those are great traits for a team to possess when you need people to function cohesively on a tight deadline and look forward to the next gig on down the line.<br />
<br />
As time as gone by and my career has grown from where it was ten years ago to where it is now, I, like many of my colleagues, have made good practice of hiring assistants to help with various tasks that will help me get done what I need to get done. There are no excuses in filmmaking... no room for getting sick or forgetting something important. I've always known I was cut out for this work upon realizing early on that it's not like any other job I'd ever had: You might not get fired for coming in overbudget or late on the deadline, but you almost certainly will never work for that person again.<br />
<br />
Assistants can make or break you, really. As I always say, use me as a shortcut &#8211; I've learned the hard way. You have to be careful on several fronts. The first question you have to ask yourself is "Is NOW really the right time for me to hire an assistant?" Ask yourself if you are far enough a long in your career that the everyday routine hassles of maintaining your studio gear, upgrading your computer OS's, doing cue sheets in Excel, and the myriad other things that we have to do as composers is taking time away from the actual very necessary task of daily composing a few minutes of finished music. If the answer is an honest "YES", then it might be time to hire an assistant.<br />
<br />
Hiring an assistant, however, is a process that you should take careful approach to. Make sure that you take plenty of time to think through the relationship that you'll have with your employee (or intern, as the case may be).<br />
<br />
Most likely, your assistant will be a student who is involved in the film scoring program at a nearby university or is finishing up junior college en route to a university program. Your screening process for this person should be pretty stout, as they will have intimate knowledge of the inner-workings of your professional AND personal lives (more on this later). Make sure that they are responsible, presentable, and articulate (the "articulate" thing is a personal pet-peeve of mine and I always go out of my way to make sure I select someone who communicates well, since this business is all about communicating, whether through musical or verbal presentation).<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Who assists?</span><br />
Be careful whom you choose. Make sure the person is trustworthy and comes with at least a few references from people vouching for that trustworthiness. I know it sounds over the top, but it is important to really scrutinize and thoroughly evaluate the person that you are bringing in &#8212; pretend that this person is ultimately a clone of YOU. When they speak, YOU are speaking; when they do something, YOU are doing it; when they act on something, YOU are acting on it. This person has to emulate you as closely as possible and do things in a manner by which YOU would do them. And they are always, ALWAYS, representing YOU.<br />
<br />
It is tempting, like a lot of athletes or even recording artists do, to hire someone that you have a track record of trust with such as a family member. However, when they say, "Never work with family," they mean it, and more often than not those kinds of arrangements don't work out in the long run. Don't be too emotionally attached to the person who is assisting you. It shouldn't be a close friend, another colleague, and especially not a family member. It's just too personal that way, and since you are the "boss" and they are the "underling," the pecking order is lined out from the get-go, often spelling trouble down the line when feelings get hurt and people feel "talked down to". The world of composing for film is simply too fast a swim to have to worry about whether you are causing a rift in your family every time you ask your dad to bring back lunch or sort through cable!<br />
<br />
I have been criticized a lot for repeatedly hiring assistants that are fairly young &#8211; a couple of them have even been fresh out of high school. There are several reasons why I chose these young people. The first reason is that I believe people are individuals, and though age does play heavily into the level of maturity in a person, I'm not going to rule out someone who is a superstar based solely on how long they've been on Earth. If I give them an assignment, can I rest assured that it will be done in a timely manner and that they will do an excellent job? The answer to that is only part of my criteria for hiring someone, but it is a huge part of it. To me, professionalism and dependability are more important than whether or not a person is in college and working out what their dissertation will be about.<br />
<br />
The second reason I am okay with hiring young people that are in school is that I rarely need a full-time assistant. Often times, I only need someone when my workload is so huge that I simply run out of time to write two to three minutes of finished music a day and accomplish all of the necessary routine business items on my punch list. I need someone who can take care of all of that for me so that I can be left alone to simply write the score for the film &#8212; which is what I have been hired to do by the producers of every project I have ever worked on (I've never been hired to run to OfficeMax and get supplies, shuttle drives back and forth, or get my computer systems serviced at the Melrose Mac!). The fact that these youngsters were just starting college and could only work at my studio from 4pm until 8pm was perfect for me and allowed me an entire day of the peace and quiet I require while I'm at the writing desk. At the same time, those four to five hours of administrative tasks still were completed daily and that also allowed me to get home at a decent time and catch my breath with my family every night.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I just like mentoring young people who have an interest in this crazy business. I often think back on the early stages of my own career and wish I had known someone who would have taken me under their wing and showed me the ropes a bit. I've spent so much of my time as a working composer trying to avoid reinventing the wheel, and it just would have been nice to have someone who could have shown me the path of least resistance in several areas of the learning journey. I want to be that resource for young composers coming up, and I've come to learn that music takes hold in most young people when they are in grade school, as it did me. Additionally, college entrants are eager to learn and haven't yet figured out that you are supposed to act like you have it all together. They ask questions when they don't understand something and they want to do a good job because they don't want to let you down. It's not about money or power or prestige for them quite yet. Instead, they are still in it for the love of the game &#8211; its about music, art, and creativity. Those are the kind of people I want on my team.<br />
<br />
As I look foward to the next two parts of this series, I want to know what you all think. If you are a composer and you have thought before about hiring someone to help out in your studio, but you weren't sure if you should take the plunge or not, let me know. Ask me questions, Let's start the conversation. I have had four assistants in my career thusfar. One of them was not so great, while the other three were complete ass kickers. One was a female while the other three were guys, and interestingly enough, the female was probably the best out of all of them &#8212; my current assistant is great friends with her, and he'd be the first to tell you that.<br />
<br />
So jump in on the Comments section below and let me hear what your concerns, observations, and questions are about hiring an assistant to accelerate and simplify your workflow. I'll be here answering as feverishly as I can, and I'm anxious to hear what the community has to say.<br />

<div id='summary3442962557114961513'><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SkrDb75RIKI/AAAAAAAAAIw/af6T3YrAY4c/s1600-h/sig-stambler.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SkrDb75RIKI/AAAAAAAAAIw/af6T3YrAY4c/s320/sig-stambler.png" border="0" /></a></div>I don&#8217;t know if this is a true story. <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000009/" rel="imdb" title="Richard Burton">Richard Burton</a> was playing the lead in a comedy on Broadway. Before making his entrance he told the stage manager, &#8220;Tonight, I&#8217;m gonna make &#8216;em cry&#8221;. He went on and, as promised, he brought the audience to tears when they should have been laughing.<br /><br />With the greatest respect to the ghost of Richard Burton, film music can also evoke tears, tension, fright and every other conceivable emotion. Speaking of ghosts, I&#8217;ve sat many times on an empty Fox scoring stage wondering how <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000581/" rel="imdb" title="Joseph L. Mankiewicz">Joseph Mankiewicz</a> reacted the first time he heard <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002136/" rel="imdb" title="Bernard Herrmann">Bernard Hermann</a>&#8217;s main title of &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Mrs-Muir-Original-Soundtrack/dp/B000001527%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB000001527" title="The Ghost And Mrs. Muir: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack" rel="amazon">The Ghost And Mrs. Muir</a>&#8221;. Did Mankiewicz break down in tears? I&#8217;ve watched that film numerous times and still cry when the final music cue enters. Today, a director hears a mock up of the score long before it gets recorded - all of which strangely leads us back to Richard Burton.<br /><br />The temp music editor can have a profound effect on setting the emotional and musical tone for a film long before the composer sinks his teeth into it. In an admittedly dangerous comparison, the temp music editor can play Richard Burton - so long as the director loves what is provided by way of temp music. The good news is the music editor can feel the power Burton had. The bad news? It doesn&#8217;t last long, so don&#8217;t let it get to your head. In fact, the best temp score retains its value with yesterday&#8217;s newspaper. On the brighter side, one good job leads to another. With the tasks of pleasing a difficult director, not alienating the composer, and keeping the studio happy - why would anyone want to edit temp music? I will provide a lengthy introductory answer, but first, welcome to SCOREcast!<br /><br />It&#8217;s a privilege to be the music editor contributor. My goals are: To provide some working advice on the politics, the creativity, and the inner workings of music editing. If I run out of sage advice I may write war stories about the good old days. My specialty is temp music although I have worked with some of the finest composers in the business. I hope to keep the material as interactive as possible, therefore comments and topic suggestions are most welcome.<br /><br />If it helps me to admit, or the reader to know, I am without the impressive music degrees that many of my peers hold. In short, I am an autodidact. I have played guitar for many years and also compose. I&#8217;m not the smartest guy on the block, but I&#8217;m pretty good at my job. <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003299/" rel="imdb" title="Marc Shaiman">Marc Shaiman</a> once dubbed me &#8220;An idiot savant&#8221;. From Marc that was a compliment, though surely he would joke otherwise.<br /><br />When I started apprenticing I had one mantra: Make money. Although raised in the film industry, I was the proud kid who didn&#8217;t want to follow in his father&#8217;s writer-producer footsteps - until I got a look at one of his pay-stubs. (Told ya I wasn&#8217;t the smartest guy on the block.) Up to then I had so many jobs I could qualify for the Guinness Book of World Records. I was married and supporting four kids while working at Ralph's Warehouse in Compton. (And that was a good job.) The day I saw his earnings I begged my Dad to get me into the his business. He called Rocky Moriana Sr. who he knew from the Paramount mail room where they had begun their careers. They made a trade; me into the Editor&#8217;s Guild, and Rocky&#8217;s son into S.A.G.<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SkrEQW6QxCI/AAAAAAAAAI4/aDQMTcbPBhk/s1600-h/alien_movie_poster.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SkrEQW6QxCI/AAAAAAAAAI4/aDQMTcbPBhk/s320/alien_movie_poster.jpg" border="0" /></a>As an apprentice I made more money than I had ever made in my life. For a few months the mantra was good. I worked ninety hours a week rewinding reels, preparing fill leader for the various sound and music editors, and running heavy hand-carts of film from one end of the studio to the other. It was grunt work, but I enjoyed everything about it. If I could only figure out what all those editors were doing. There was no Wikipedia.<br /><br />After several months, with no inspiration other than money, I became discouraged at the relentless assembly line. The epiphanic day occurred when I sneaked onto the Fox scoring stage and watched <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000025/" rel="imdb" title="Jerry Goldsmith">Jerry Goldsmith</a> conduct <span style="font-style: italic;">"</span>Alien<span style="font-style: italic;">"</span>. I fell in love with movie making and though I was raised in the business, I saw it in a fresh light of creativity and magic. How lucky was I to breathe the same air with those great musicians? I am still excited to sit on a scoring stage, or cut a music cue and see it on a fifty foot screen.<br /><br />Why one would want to edit music? You tell me.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbha6utmzM0">Jerry Goldsmith Conducts</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IOxyIn7MVQ">The Ghost And Mrs Muir - Music By Bernard Herrmann</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nInE5TITzE8">Who's Afraid Of Richard Burton</a><br /><br /><br />      <div style="margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;" class="zemanta-pixie"><a class="zemanta-pixie-a" href="http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/5a25e4a3-41b0-41d6-965f-cc4900fcd508/" title="Reblog this post [with Zemanta]"><img style="border: medium none ; float: right;" class="zemanta-pixie-img" src="http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=5a25e4a3-41b0-41d6-965f-cc4900fcd508" alt="Reblog this post [with Zemanta]" /></a><span class="zem-script more-related pretty-attribution"><script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js" defer="defer"></script></span></div></div>

<br />
Combine my work-weekend with this month's overarching topic of <span style="font-style: italic;">workflow</span>, and you arrive somewhere in the vicinity of this weekend's provocation:<br />
<div><div><b></b><br />
<b><blockquote>Composers should never keep a regular schedule.</blockquote></b></div><div>Here we're venturing into something a little more personal, a little more debatable on its surface, than previous provocations. Chasing the Muse is something we all approach in our own way. And while many (most?) successful composers I know have a pretty hard-core writing regimen&#8212;or at least find themselves writing every day out of necessity!&#8212;there are more than a few whose hours tend to be, how you say, erratic.<br />
<br />
None of that, though, is really the point of the provocation&#8230; as always, it's merely intended to stir up some thoughts. To take on the issue from a different angle. And, at least with this weekend's discussion topic, allow us to approach the nexus of <i>organization</i> (rigid, structured&#8230; left-brained, if you're comfortable with that label) and <i>creativity</i> (the very definition of unconstrained right-brain-dom) in a way we might not otherwise consider.<br />
<br />
I need help this weekend, lurkers! I'm stuck in the studio, so I need some feedback on this one.</div><div>If you've never offered an opinion here before, jump in now and make your voice heard. What does this provocation suggest to you? Anything that might help out your fellow colleagues? Words of advice, war stories, different perspectives?</div></div></div>

I found myself at somewhat of a loss.  My gosh, I thought, there are so many, and they all just blur together, I can't think of any in particular.<br /><br />But no.  There <span style="font-style: italic;">is </span>one that stands out.  I'm almost embarrassed to talk about it, because it goes <span style="font-style: italic;">so </span>far back, to 1961.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Side_Story_%28film%29"><span style="font-style: italic;">West Side Story</span></a> - scored by <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Bernstein" title="Leonard Bernstein" rel="wikipedia">Leonard Bernstein</a>.<br /><br />Now, <span style="font-style: italic;">West Side Story</span> wasn't originally a film -- it was a Broadway musical, based on a novel, in turn based on <span style="font-style: italic;">Romeo and Juliet</span>.  But it was a <span style="font-style: italic;">huge</span> success when it came to the screen, winning 10 Academy Awards, not to mention blowing me away.  <span style="font-style: italic;">West Side Story </span>was really different from anything I'd ever seen or heard.  One of those 70 mm spectacles that you don't see these days.  The dancing was really cool, and the lyrics outrageous, but it was Bernstein's<span style="font-style: italic;"> music </span>that really stuck with me.  Even today, almost half a century later (is that possible?), I still remember the most minute details.<br /><br />But, unlike many of my fellow SCOREcast contributors, I <span style="font-style: italic;">didn't</span> immediately think, <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>I gotta write music like that, gotta be a film composer</span>.  At that time, I wanted to be a <span style="font-style: italic;">singer</span>, and Bernstein's music just kind of hit me in the pit of my stomach.  A lot of it was <span style="font-style: italic;">hormones</span>, I think -- stars in my eyes.  After all, I was about 13 when <span style="font-style: italic;">West Side Story</span> came out.  I wanted to be ... <span style="font-style: italic;">Tony</span>.  And, of course, I imagined myself singing to the likes of <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000081/" title="Natalie Wood" rel="imdb">Natalie Wood</a> (Maria).<br /><br />My high school put on a musical every year, and I kept hoping the music department would decide to do <span style="font-style: italic;">West Side Story</span> and that I'd get the chance to be Tony, even if I wasn't playing opposite Natalie.  It didn't come to pass.<br /><br />But I kept hoping.  I had a copy of the soundtrack album, and I went over and over the songs.  One 60's morning around 10 AM, when I thought nobody was home, I was <span style="font-style: italic;">being</span> Tony, singing <span style="font-style: italic;">Maria</span> at the top of my lungs when, to my extreme embarassment, I heard somebody yell, "Will ya shut up, I'm trying to sleep!"  Sorry, Dad.<br /><br />[It's interesting to learn that I was in good company in my quest to become Tony.   According to <span style="font-style: italic;">Wikipedia, </span>when the part of Tony was being cast for the film, the list of eager contenders included <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000062/" title="Elvis Presley" rel="imdb">Elvis Presley</a>, Warren Beatty, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002147/" title="Tab Hunter" rel="imdb">Tab Hunter</a>, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000578/" title="Anthony Perkins" rel="imdb">Anthony Perkins</a>, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0848560/" title="Russ Tamblyn" rel="imdb">Russ Tamblyn</a>, Burt Reynolds, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001148/" title="Troy Donahue" rel="imdb">Troy Donahue</a>, Bobby Darin, Richard Chamberlain, Gary Lockwood, and <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000937/" title="Richard Beymer" rel="imdb">Richard Beymer</a>.  Beymer was eventually selected.]<br /><br />Things have a way of morphing over time.  I ended up going off in a completely non-musical direction in the years that followed, with Tony locked up somewhere inside.  I didn't re-emerge until several decades had passed and I realized I had to let him out -- that it wasn't too late.  It was then -- about 10 years ago -- that a new musical journey began for me.  No, I probably wasn't going to be Tony, but I could still <span style="font-style: italic;">create </span>music that moved me the way I'd been moved so many years before.  I began to put the pieces together, one after another, until it dawned on me that composing for film and other media was a viable as a new career path.  The rest is history still in the making.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">There's a time for us ...</span>            <div style="margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;" class="zemanta-pixie"><a class="zemanta-pixie-a" href="http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/7299e3c8-b1d8-46e6-9f43-70a8806300fd/" title="Reblog this post [with Zemanta]"><img style="border: medium none ; float: right;" class="zemanta-pixie-img" src="http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=7299e3c8-b1d8-46e6-9f43-70a8806300fd" alt="Reblog this post [with Zemanta]" /></a><span class="zem-script more-related pretty-attribution"><script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js" defer="defer"></script></span></div></div>

I tell you this because music for me is a personal and emotional journey. Whether I&#8217;m listening to a Top 40 hit or a film score, the music has to touch me... It has to tug on my emotions. Film music has always intrigued me in that a car chase scene or a love scene can spark my interest. Not just that it's there in the scene, but that something inside of me &#8212; my &#8220;emotimeter&#8221; &#8212; turns on. </span></span>  <p style="font-family: georgia;font-family:georgia;" class="MsoNormal" ><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Like most of the contributors and composers on SCOREcast, we all have had the &#8220;Wow&#8221; experience... The moment that you said, &#8220;I want to do this&#8221;. It&#8217;s that emotional connection; even though it may come to us in very different ways, it connects us. </span></span></p>  <p style="font-family: georgia;font-family:georgia;" class="MsoNormal" ><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span">I won&#8217;t bore you with my &#8220;Music is the Universal Language&#8221; diatribe, but it really does communicate across boundaries and in this case without words. I always listened attentively to the score in films; it always kind of stuck out to me. I always noticed what was happening, behind the action of the movie. </span></span></p>  <p style="font-family: georgia;font-family:georgia;" class="MsoNormal" ><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Now, <span style="font-style: italic;">The <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Lion-King-Special-Various-Artists/dp/B0000CABJ2%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0000CABJ2" title="The Lion King: Special Edition" rel="amazon">Lion King</a></span> had been out for a while, and this particular day I was helping a buddy of mine in his studio. He had one of the first surround sound production facilities in the state and we where doing some calibration and listening tests. He happened to have The Lion King and we where listening to this in surround through the system making adjustments. After the gigantic opening song &#8220;Circle of Life&#8221;, I continued to sit there listening to the rest of the score as the movie progressed. A few minutes later, I had switched mentally from listening to the levels of the surround system that we where calibrating, to being engrossed in the score and how it reinforced the movie and the story line. I was lost, in a good way. My &#8220;emotimeter&#8221; was on in full, and I did not want to leave that studio seat. </span></span></p>  <p style="font-family: georgia;font-family:georgia;" class="MsoNormal" ><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span">I remember that day as vividly as today. Normally I don&#8217;t admit that I&#8217;m a softy and sometimes cry at &#8220;Chick Flicks&#8221;, but at a few points of the movie I found myself getting choked up, trying to hold back the tears. Something was moving me inside and I could not get over the music that I was hearing. The thing was, it wasn&#8217;t any particular piece, cue, or moment... it was the whole thing. The entire package. </span></span></p>  <p style="font-family: georgia;font-family:georgia;" class="MsoNormal" ><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span">I had to see who the person was who had created this music and the score. I had never heard of <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001877/" title="Hans Zimmer" rel="imdb">Hans Zimmer</a> up to this point. At this point in my career, I never followed that industry or side of the music business. My first thought was, "What a cool name!" Hans. I started to research more about him. I thought, "Anybody who can bring me to tears and full of emotion in an animated film must be pretty good."</span></span></p><p style="font-family: georgia;font-family:georgia;" class="MsoNormal" ><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span"> Later I had learned that he had won the OSCAR in 1994 for best score for this movie. He obviously moved a bunch of other people as well.<br /></span></span></p>  <p style="font-family: georgia;font-family:georgia;" class="MsoNormal" ><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span">So, I would like to thank Hans Zimmer for touching me that day enough to not only spark my curiosity to start listening to more scores in movies, but also to want to be one of the people who creates this music that moves people. I want to make people feel how I did that day watching and listening in the studio. Now, if I only had only half the talent of Hans (and maybe his composing rig!), I might be happier. </span></span></p><p style="font-family: georgia;font-family:georgia;" class="MsoNormal" ><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span">And that fact that he worked with the "Buggles" and appeared in the video "Video Killed the Radio Star" also did it for me.</span></span></p><p style="font-family: georgia;font-family:georgia;" class="MsoNormal" ><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span">LOL</span></span></p>  <p style="font-family: georgia;font-family:georgia;" class="MsoNormal" ><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Thanks Hans!</span></span></p>  <p style="font-family: georgia;font-family:georgia;" class="MsoNormal" ><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Now where is my 1983 Casio?</span></span></p>  <!--EndFragment--><br /><br /><br /><center><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/E3Z1PXxI1qI&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/E3Z1PXxI1qI&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="344" width="425"></embed></object></center><br /><br /> <div style="margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;" class="zemanta-pixie"><a class="zemanta-pixie-a" href="http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/a4b55c81-dd0c-42c9-93b6-eea4bb34d925/" title="Reblog this post [with Zemanta]"><img style="border: medium none ; float: right;" class="zemanta-pixie-img" src="http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=a4b55c81-dd0c-42c9-93b6-eea4bb34d925" alt="Reblog this post [with Zemanta]" /></a><span class="zem-script more-related pretty-attribution"><script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js" defer="defer"></script></span></div></div>

I keep coming back to this time and time again, as I think Andrew really hit the nail on the head:<br /><br /><blockquote>"...I always wonder if [people] confuse their influences with their favorite composers, which are not always the same thing. I&#8217;ll put it this way, influences run more deeply and subconsciously than &#8216;my fave five&#8217; composers. For instance, I love <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky" rel="wikipedia" title="Igor Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a>. And I love to say that I love Stravinsky; it&#8217;s a win-win. However, the reality is that going to see &#8216;Back to the Future&#8217; when I was a kid had a much bigger impact on me musically. Let&#8217;s just say I REALLY wanted to play Johnny B. Goode as quickly as possible. In the long term, Igor has sustained me, but Marty got me on the road."</blockquote><br />I think the "<a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_in_Black" rel="wikipedia" title="Men in Black">Men in Black</a>" score "sustained" me, but also "got me on the road".  I'm showing how young I am here, as most others would probably cite older films as their gateway, but I think this was the first film score I had heard that captured my imagination and showed me the possibilities of music in film.  I don't know what it was in the score that struck a chord (pardon the pun) somewhere inside me, but it definitively still resonates the same special feeling to this day when I listen to it.  I think I was 11 when I first heard it, and I immediately got the soundtrack for my birthday - the first CD I ever had! I couldn't put it down and just kept listening to it.  I couldn't believe the sounds <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000384/" rel="imdb" title="Danny Elfman">Elfman</a> was creating and I was hearing.  The orchestral colours he used, the mixture of styles and sounds, the epic and whacky mood all mixed into one.<br /><br />What's funny is, I created a track about a year or two ago and subconsciously had written a section of music which was nearly identical to a part of the score of Men in Black - even though I hadn't listened to the MIB score in about 10 years! I was sitting there scratching my head thinking...."why does this sound so familiar?" I couldn't believe that something I had heard a decade ago had influenced me so deeply, that I could subconsciously write music based on it.<br /><br />From those first four deep notes on the cello, we know we're in for a ride.  In my opinion, Elfman's music for this opening sequence is close to perfection and is a prime example of excellent film scoring - every time I hear that opening sequence, I can see the dragonfly buzzing along the highway, swooping up and down, then getting splattered all over the windscreen as we see on screen.  And that in my opinion is one of a number of things, that makes excellent film music - when you hear that cue, you immediately remember what it was referring to in the film.<br /><br /><center><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/5ldEqooNMbI&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/5ldEqooNMbI&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="344" width="425"></embed>,</object></center></div>

My "Gateway Score" experience may seem overlay dramatic and romanticized to everyone but me, but this is how it happened.<br />
<br />
When Chariots of Fire came out in 1981, my parents decided we would all go as a family and see it. To 10-year-old me, that was code for <b><i>bo-ring</i></b>. So there I was sitting in the theatre - we went to the Cinedomes in Orange - the best theatre around in '81, at least that I knew of - the lights went down and the film started with this boring monologue - a poetic eulogy no less, at a funeral, and I started to get comfortable to go to sleep. But before I could the scene changed to these guys running on the beach and this music faded in, something I did not <i>at all </i>expect. Synthesizers, in a <i>movie</i>?  <br />
<div></div><br />
<br />
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_P3p3I805INU/SkqHQaOv6UI/AAAAAAAAABQ/JAKwdr0Q7wc/s1600-h/200px-Chariots_of_fire.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5353239823072094530" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_P3p3I805INU/SkqHQaOv6UI/AAAAAAAAABQ/JAKwdr0Q7wc/s320/200px-Chariots_of_fire.jpg" style="float: right; height: 311px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; width: 200px;" /></a>Then that first bass note. If you've seen Chariots of Fire at least a couple times, you know the note I'm talking about. That one single note flipped a switch in me. No exaggeration, that's what it felt like. The note actually got an audible "Oooo" from the audience too, so it wasn't just me. So I was instantly captivated. Funny, I still didn't care about the film (at the time) but I simply couldn't wait to hear the next cue.</div><div></div><br />
<div>After the movie ended, I needed more; I had to hear it again, but I wasn't yet aware of "soundtracks". So it was a great gift when my dad bought me a cassette of the soundtrack. Later, we also bought the movie on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videodisc">Videodisc</a> (yeah, not Laserdisc) which gave me even more music - the boy's choir in the Cambridge scene, the cool training scene showing the evil American team, and so on. I ended up dubbing my soundtrack onto another cassette, inserting these additional cues where they belonged in the film, making my own "Chariots of Fire - extended version".</div><br />
<div></div><div>It still wasn't enough. We had a piano in the house (my sister was taking lessons) and I ended up sitting for hours with my cheap tape player, teaching myself to play some of the cues. Only when I could play the main title theme and the boys' choir cue did I feel this nagging need for more begin to subside.</div><br />
<div></div><div>If that's not a Gateway score, I don't know what is.</div></div><br />
