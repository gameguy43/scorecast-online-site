I'll admit, this month I fell a little behind on reading the articles everyday. Usually, I get up early, get ready for the day, and then settle into the Musicave to check my email and peruse all of my morning news sites to get my bearings for the day. However, this last week has seen a ton of meetings about projects and upcoming speaking engagements (good problems to have, mind you!), and so I've been running since the second my feet stepped out of the shower every morning. I'm just now finishing reading this month… and boy, was it a doozie!" />

With so many perspectives and so many amazing discussions about &#8220;spotting a film&#8221;, there is a veritable masterclass swimming around in these pages. (Hmmm… SCO online classes. Hmmmmmm!!!!!!!)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit, this month I fell a little behind on reading the articles everyday. Usually, I get up early, get ready for the day, and then settle into the Musicave to check my email and peruse all of my morning news sites to get my bearings for the day. However, this last week has seen a ton of meetings about projects and upcoming speaking engagements (good problems to have, mind you!), and so I&#8217;ve been running since the second my feet stepped out of the shower every morning. I&#8217;m just now finishing reading this month… and boy, was it a doozie!<br />
<a name="more"></a><br />
Obviously, the common denominator in &#8220;spotting&#8221; is knowing when to musically shut up or speak up. Of course it is much more than that—the art of spotting a film is certainly not that simple—but when you get right down to it, the process is ultimately about silence and your use of silence to support the story in a musical sense.</p>
<p>Kind of like &#8220;life&#8221;. In fact, conceptually, the idea of &#8220;spotting&#8221; could be—and frankly, <em>should be</em>—applied to every facet of your film composing career. It’s about <em>timing</em>. And so much in this gig seems to be about timing. The right time to demo. The right time to call. The right time to write. The right time to present for approval. The right time to get an agent. The right time to dump an agent!</p>
<p>Timing is scary. It’s one of those things that we in the entertainment industry have zero control over. Think about it. Screenwriters sell or shelve scripts based on the <em>timing</em> of the market. Film studios make educated guesses as to when to release a property only to their best judgement of… <em>timing</em>. Agents deluge producers with demo materials and suggestions for composers based on their best guesses as to the <em>timing</em> of the post-production schedule. Actors either pull off a line or their performance falls flat based mostly on the <em>timing</em> of their delivery. In the movie biz, <em>timing</em> is everything.</p>
<p>It seems if we master timing, everything will fall into place. Yet, a mastery of timing is fleeting, at best. We cannot control time, nor can we control events that happen <em>after</em> we decide to act. Therefore, timing is a difficult rascal to wrangle.</p>
<p>Maybe it only comes with experience. I remember &#8220;spotting&#8221; my first few films and having a hell of a time getting it right. It wasn&#8217;t that I&#8217;d never heard a well-spotted film before… in fact, I&#8217;d studied plenty. But as a kid in his late teens, with little-to-no seasoned life-experience yet, my &#8220;life&#8221; itself was not well spotted, therefore how could I spot someone&#8217;s onscreen life? As I&#8217;ve matured and grown older, I&#8217;ve experienced many thing that have also matured my sense of musical placement and the appropriateness thereof. My spotting has improved greatly, and now, with the occasional need for assistance, I can spot through a film well and not worry if my tone is off.</p>
<p>That said, I still believe without a doubt that the best person to spot a film (or at least have at the spotting session) is a <strong><em>music editor</em></strong>. At least on a feature film. Reality television and even sometimes other TV programming won&#8217;t require one, not to mention provide one. Some of you just starting out will not yet be hip to the notion of <em>music editing </em>as a definable and distinguishable artform, as maybe you don&#8217;t know a real-life music editor… that being someone who does it day-in and day-out as a professional. Others of you might never have worked on a budget that afforded you a music editor, and you haven&#8217;t experienced the opportunity to spot with one. Until I moved to LA, I didn&#8217;t know any either. But these people have literally come in and saved a million poorly spotted film scores simply by giving them a much needed final listen.</p>
<p>If you can, hire a music editor from the get-go. Put it in YOUR budget. Chances are your director probably doesn&#8217;t even realize that there are highly-skilled people out there that do this type of work everyday in our industry. On certain projects, I&#8217;ve been goaded by directors into forgoing the hiring of a music editor, and in the end, I&#8217;m always sorry that I did. These people posses a knowledge of film music and cinema that is unparalleled.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m mentioning music editors here because I&#8217;ve noticed something about many of them. They are older people. I don&#8217;t necessarily mean &#8220;age-wise&#8221;. I mean, they&#8217;ve &#8220;been around&#8221;. Music editors are the &#8220;sages&#8221; of our industry; they know what&#8217;s up and they can translate in from screen to ear quite instinctively. I trust music editors. I&#8217;d trust them with other elements of my life, not just my music. It is rare when you feel that way about a group of people, but there is something very comforting about &#8220;experience&#8221;, and &#8220;life-experience&#8221; in particular. Music editors, for some reason, have that aura about them. They&#8217;ve <em>been</em> <em>there</em> and <em>done</em> <em>that</em>. As a species, they seem to be very worldly people who are highly intelligent and have a knack for simplifying difficult matters. They can break complex ideas down into manageable bites. I&#8217;ve seen variations on the following scenario hundreds of times in spotting sessions: A director is having a hard time conveying an idea about the emotional arc of a character. As we all gaze into the air in complete and utter perplexity, the music editor says, &#8220;So you want us to feel bad for this guy, basically.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boom. Done. Next.</p>
<p>But what is you have no real &#8220;life-experience&#8221;, or at least, not enough that you feel would qualify you for what I&#8217;m referring to here? How do you make up for life-experience when you are just getting started? You watch movies. You live through film. That is the only way to do it.</p>
<p>In his book &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Movies-Sidney-Lumet/dp/0679756604">Making Movies</a>&#8220;, director Sidney Lumet says, &#8220;When I contemplate any major decision in life, the first thing I do is <em>run the film</em>.&#8221; I think that is what we are talking about here. <em>Running the film.</em> The film of your life. Playing out, in your head, a situation in real-life in a cinematic fashion. Some people might call it &#8220;planning ahead&#8221;, or &#8220;beginning it the end in mind&#8221;. Whatever works, but it all has to do with timing. Pay attention to your timing. Your timing. Your timing. When you watch a film, watch the timing. Notice the &#8220;beats&#8221;. Make note of the silences. Try to separate yourself from the story enough to objectively watch with your &#8220;spotting eyes&#8221;. Get past the technicalities of the rest of the process and ask yourself if you can detect where the music enters and as it rails out, at what point there is nothing. It will be easy to do once you are mindful of it. The score will stick out to you if it is poorly placed, and if placed well, you&#8217;ll constantly have to “wake up” to the awareness of it again.</p>
<p>Start now to train yourself to really <em>experience</em> a film rather than merely <em>watching</em> through it. When starting out, so much of what we take in we allow to enter only through the eye. Big mistake. Film scoring is a multi-sensory artform. You must hear the tonalities, see the colors, smell the scents, touch the textures, and taste the emotions of your characters. You have to <em>feel</em> it, and to feel it you have to open up all of your senses to truly experience it.</p>
<p>While these &#8220;technical&#8221; aspects of spotting couldn’t possibly make up for life-experience as a guideline for placement of emotive sonics, it will train you to at least get into the habit of doing more than simply watching a film. Then, when you finally find yourself one day ready to take on a spot from an experienced perspective, the mechanics of the work will naturally fall into place.</p>
<p><strong>COMMENTS</strong> are open below. I’d like to hear your throughs on this. There are a lot of ways to do something and no one way is <em>THE</em> way. Tell me what you think are the better skills you’ve learned in spotting films. I’d like to know what methods you employ, whether educational, psychological, or mechanical, to build the spot for films that you work on. Think, ponder, speak, debate, editorialize!</p>
<p>On to April!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>SCOREcast founder <span style="font-weight: bold;">DEANE OGDEN</span> is an award-winning     composer who has written the music to over twenty feature films     including THE SENSEI, DREAMS ON SPEC, THE     WAY HOME, and THE EVOLUTION OF DAD. Also very active in music for television, Deane wrote the     orchestral themes for Michael Phelps&#8217; record-breaking gold medal run     during the 2008 OLYMPIC GAMES, which was the most-viewed event in     American television history. Deane is a top-call session drummer, and     has recorded and performed with artists like TINA TURNER, JOSS STONE,    SEAL, and RIHANNA.

Plenty of good observations here, for example, the value of living through films.  I rent three films a month from <a href="http://lovefilm.com" rel="nofollow">lovefilm.com</a> and I usually watch each one at least twice if it&#39;s any good, so that I can absorb details that are normally missed the first time.</p>
<p>But your comments about life experience in particular struck a chord for me.  Having started this game later in life, I&#39;ve sometimes had thoughts about the fact that I wanted to write for film in my early twenties, and abandoned the dream.  Invariably, any regret I feel in these moments is quickly erased by the realisation that I probably had to live through a couple more decades to become wiser and more savvy about life, precisely so that I could paint the colours of life from a richer palette.  To be frank, I was a late developer: I think my teenage persona stuck around until I was at least 25.  Had I made a start at that age, maybe I would have given up in frustration.  Maybe it&#39;s better that I waited until I had more of the requisite skills and life experience&#8230; after all, 40 is the new 30 :)</p>

<p>I&#39;m always reading about the film composer doing a mock up of the soundtrack to picture to show the director his work. Regarding these mock ups, can you give me some idea how complete they are, and more specifically, how much time goes into making them sound as realistic as possible, with respect to articulations, dynamics, orchestration, etc. Mock ups themselves, if done for realism, is a considerable task just by itself. With timelines always being tight, where is the time found for completing this endeavor. I think the how-to&#39;s of mock ups would make for a great article.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

I pursued Theory and Composition as a major in college, but didn&#8217;t get to finish due to &#8220;Life&#8221; happening. I too, often wondered what would have happened if I would have not gotten married, had kids&#8230;etc. My conclusion is&#8230;I would probably be miserable without going through those up&#8217;s and down&#8217;s. So now my music reflects my life and all of its emotions whether I am composing for a play, a 10 minute skit at the local church, or a iPOD video I made of  our dog. I think if I was able to do my dream in my 20&#8242;s, I don&#8217;t think I would have made it. Now that I am older and (a little) wiser, I know how to deal with life issues and continue to move forward.</p>
