<p>Merry Christmas, SCOREcasters!

Grab a hot cup of nog and a slice of that pumpkin pie and settle in for a terrific discussion with Simon as he walks you through working on several of the highest-grossing pictures of all-time, including <em>Titanic </em>and <em>Avatar</em>, plus the complete behind-the-scenes story of the score to his newest film, <em>The Magnificent Seven</em>, where he took up the mantle of his dear friend James Horner and turned out one of 2016&#8217;s most notable musical achievements.</p>

<p>SCOREcast ushered in a new decade of worldwide community goodness this past January as we celebrated our 10th Anniversary with 130 of LA&#8217;s finest SCOREcasters, as well as some friends and family from around the globe, at our annual dinner in Los Angeles. All of this happened in the midst of Deane and Brian&#8217;s 15th trip to the NAMM Convention, and the boys use this episode to talk about the highlights from this year&#8217;s show. They also cover the controversy surrounding the recent Academy Awards telecast, as well as an exciting new opportunity for composers and filmmakers happening this month in Los Angeles through something called the &#8220;Helix Collective&#8221;.</p>

In the 46th episode of the SCOREcast Podcast Show, Deane and Brian visit with Greg Curtis, owner of <em>The Bridge Recording</em> in Los Angeles, which is one of the busiest scoring stages in the LA basin. Greg explains how he has stayed at the top of the scoring studio business by applying cutting-edge technology, strategies and staying composer-focussed in the design of his company. The boys then engage in a long conversation about how to navigate just about any political scenario you might encounter in your media music career.

		<description><![CDATA[You ain't no Williams… and that's not such a bad thing.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>None of us are the same.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll never have to worry about competing with John Williams. I know what you are thinking: &#8220;No kidding, dude!&#8221;</p>
<p>No, I mean it. John Williams will never sound like you can. He&#8217;ll never sound like me. He&#8217;s not able. You might say, &#8220;Um, Deane, excuse me, but John Williams is arguably the single greatest composer living today. He can do anything.&#8221; To which I would respond, &#8220;Yes he is&#8230; and no he cannot.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Williams can never be Deane Ogden, or James Newton Howard, , or John Debney, or Brian Ralston, or Alexandre Desplat, or Sharon Farber, or Chris Young, or Adrian Ellis, or Hans Zimmer, or Brian Satterwhite, or Richard Bellis, or Tim Montijo, or Alan Silvestri. As long as he has written for the screen, as hard as he might try, as much as he may study, he&#8217;ll never get there. Our music flows from a place that John Williams could never understand or even come close to comprehending. He could not possibly get it and he never will.</p>
<p>Conversely, as hard as <em>we</em> try, as hard as <em>we</em> study, and as hard as <em>we</em> practice, <em>we</em> will never sound like John Williams. John Williams never has to worry you nor I. Why? Because none of us could ever fathom what John Williams had to go through to write his most recent note. We will never know the place John Williams writes from. We don&#8217;t <em>get</em> him, and we never ever will.</p>
<p>We are all different people with different lives, different sets of experiences, born of different parents, facing radically different futures. Therefore, <em>competition</em>, at least in the form by which we usually refer to it, doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>People talk about <em>competition</em> all the time. I hear constantly from players how hard it is to compete with the convenience of samples (not the <em>quality</em> of them&#8230;. the <em>convenience</em> of them!). Of course, we all have experienced competition within our own ranks, being put up against each other by our own representative agencies for projects, always with that same reassurance from them, &#8220;Hey don&#8217;t worry… this one&#8217;s got YOU written all over it!&#8221; Uh huh.</p>
<p>Professional golfers say often that there is no competition amongst their tribe, but rather only that which exists between each golfer and the golf course itself. To a pro golfer, the other golfer on the course is not the competitor, but the curve of a fairway or the placement of a hazard. I&#8217;ve always found that concept fascinating and I&#8217;ve often pondered how it might apply to our situation as music and film Creatives. There really is no one entity in the film music community that you need ever have to worry about competing with, save for one&#8230; your own <em>music</em>. Yes, the most fierce competition out there that you&#8217;ll face as a composer is the last score you wrote. Your true nemesis resides right there, in the pit of your own stomach—the drive to better yourself. To set a goal, achieve it, set a loftier goal, achieve that, and so on, and so forth. Creatives have it in their guts to up their own ante. As Creatives, we are our own fiercest competition, our own worst enemies.</p>
<p>Creatives are different than other people. It&#8217;s politically correct to say that we aren&#8217;t—that we are just like construction workers, attorneys, corporate buyers, or police officers—but when you get honest about it, we most certainly AREN&#8217;T like any of those people. We are a different animal. We don&#8217;t think, analyze, opine, or expend our energy the way non-creatives do. We also don&#8217;t rest, work, vacation, engage, or &#8220;unplug&#8221; the way that non-creatives do. We rarely ever stop creating, whether we are writing at our workstations or writing in our heads at the dinner table. We often get accused of not being &#8220;present&#8221; during conversations or engaged in our surroundings (sound familiar?). We daydream a lot. We also have a greater need for solitude and seclusion and often are told that we lean towards being &#8220;reclusive&#8221;. By all counts, we are simply <em>different</em>. And what drives us is different, also.</p>
<p>Creatives are <em>driven</em> in a way that no other human tribe is. We are driven to create, yet in that process of creating—when we are really <em>down in it</em>— composers in particular tend to lose track of something that is vital to long-term success: Self-Improvement. So many composers—even the A-listers who some view as &#8220;leading the pack&#8221; in terms of pushing the boundaries of the craft—rely on their same old bag of tricks, their tried-and-true methods of creating&#8230; the things that have always worked for them. The crutches. The old standards. The &#8220;reliables&#8221;.</p>
<p>It gets worse as you move up the ladder. I recently sat with an A-list composer friend of mine and we talked about the differences between the terraces of the film composing career. We talked about the contrasts of handling 1-2 million dollar studio budgets versus 30-90k indie budgets, managing a team of 25 versus an army of One, and working with our agencies as opposed to negotiating our own deals. But when we started talking <em>creativity</em>, I ask him what the major differences were that he saw between his A-list position and when he first started out as an indie film guy. Here&#8217;s what he said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>&#8220;Deane, when you have done this as long as I&#8217;ve been fortunate to, you develop a sound. And that sound is what you then become known for. Once you have your sound, in a strange way, it&#8217;s over for you creatively. That&#8217;s all they want. That sound. You don&#8217;t get to experiment, they don&#8217;t want you to try anything new. They just want the sound. Then it is up to you. You have to then figure out a way to manipulate that sound—the sound that is YOU—so that it evolves and changes, yet to them, it is still that sound. But to you, it becomes something else. Something different every time. And it&#8217;s always got to be better than the last time, because if it&#8217;s not, then what&#8217;s the point for you? If you aren&#8217;t doing better work each and every time you score a picture, you are cheating yourself and at that point it really is just a service job. It&#8217;s heartless, then. No life. I&#8217;m not saying that&#8217;s easy, Deane. Getting to the point of besting yourself each time out is a hard thing to do, and most composers haven&#8217;t figured out how to do it. But it is possible if you work at it. But that&#8217;s the rub—it takes a lot of patience and a lot of hard work.&#8221;<br />
</em></p>
<h1>The Passion to Be <em>You</em></h1>
<p>Finding your own voice or sound can be daunting at best and impossible at worst. Is it something you can just conjure up, or must it come to you organically, born out of doing film music for long periods of time? Who knows. It&#8217;s probably different for everybody. But certainly, the commonality exists that you must be conscious of it before you set out to be original. In doing so, however, be careful not to set out to be different from everyone else. If you do, you&#8217;ll be looking at others more than you should be. When you focus too much on outside factors, you begin to lose track of what you are trying to accomplish in your own craft.</p>
<p>Exerting effort to be better than the next person will get you nowhere. Well, that&#8217;s not entirely true; it will get you somewhere, but <em>somewhere</em> is a place that you won&#8217;t like very much. Better to concentrate instead on besting yourself. You&#8217;ll never be better than John Williams at what he does. Williams is the best Williams there is. You&#8217;ll never do Tom Newman better than Tom Newman does Tom Newman. I&#8217;m not talking about not having to &#8220;live up&#8221; to the temp, or having to create something with the same vibe as what the director has been infatuated with since the beginning of post. In fact, I believe that &#8220;temp love&#8221; is less about the music and more about the feeling of the scene. (There has never been a situation in my own career when I wasn&#8217;t able to talk the director off the steep cliff of &#8220;recreating the temp&#8221;. It&#8217;s easy to do if you can articulate how the music is not really the issue—the scene is.)</p>
<p>What am I suggesting? Am I saying that competition isn&#8217;t productive? Of course not. What I&#8217;m saying is that competing against <em>yourself</em>, allowing your <em>own</em> brand of greatness to slowly unfold, is better than buzzing harder to keep up with the swarm.</p>
<p>Allow <em>your</em> music to do the talking.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Many might argue that Hollywood is more concerned these days about having "hit films" than it is about creating successful ones. What's the difference?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p>What kind of &#8220;professional&#8221; walks out on a film set to start production in less than two weeks?James Franco does, that&#8217;s who. That&#8217;s right. After already spending half a million on pre-production just weeks away from shooting, James Franco pulled out of GARDEN OF LAST DAYS, a film he was directing and starring in. The reason? According to Mike Flemming at <em>Deadline Hollywood:</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Franco’s exit had to do with a disagreement with financier Millennium over the crew he wanted to hire. Basically, Franco put together a crew that didn’t &#8220;have the experience&#8221; to get approval from the bond company. Millennium wouldn’t approve his choices.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p>There are a couple different ways to interpret what happened. I realize we are armchair quarterbacking this and not privy to exactly what happened. But think about it with me for a moment. One possible scenario is that Millennium just did not want to do the project any more out of their fear it would lose money and they quietly, under the table, told the bond company to not approve the crew. This would allow them to save the relationship with their star Franco and blame the film not happening on the faceless bond company. That is a possibility. Also&#8230;I am told the bond company does not really care if the film is good&#8230;just if the film can be done on the budget laid out. It is possible the $3M budgeted was certain to go way over budget and the crew assembled did not have the experience to navigate a tight budget. They most likely met with everyone they would have been concerned about&#8230; and discovered the way they are wanting to shoot, there would be no way they were going to only spend $3M. The bond company estimation could have been much higher to finish the film Franco wanted to make and so determined his crew didn&#8217;t know how to be efficient with their choices. That is also possible for sure. But part of me thinks something else may be going on.</p>
<p>James Franco is a rather talented guy who has shown his talent both in front of and behind the camera. He also is someone in this industry who I would consider to be a true &#8220;artist&#8221;. I have always felt he is creating art when he works. He takes chances. He works on both indies and Blockbusters. He breaks barriers. And he has also finally earned the respect of many in Hollywood as an &#8220;A-list&#8221; actor. There is little doubt he knows what he is doing when it comes to making a successful film. So why would a studio/bond company trust him enough to hire him as a director, but not trust his choices for his crew?</p>
<p>I was speaking with a director/producer friend of mine.  He is an active AMPAS member, respected by his peers, and use to be a studio executive in addition to his producing work. So he has been on both sides of the process of making and releasing a film. He knows what he is talking about. He shared with me a profound concept that explains how to interpret what is going on in Hollywood here. And he learned it from Hal Prince, an American theatrical producer and director who has worked on many of the best-known Broadway musical productions of the past 50 years. Hal has garnered twenty-one Tony Awards, more than any other individual, including eight for directing, eight for producing the year&#8217;s Best Musical, two as Best Producer of a Musical and three special awards. Cabaret, West Side Story, Cats, Evite, Phantom Of The Opera. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Hal said there is a difference between a &#8220;Hit&#8221; &amp; a &#8220;Flop&#8221; and a &#8220;Success&#8221; &amp; a &#8220;Failure.&#8221; One set of terms has to do with money&#8230;the other does not.</p>
<p>A <em><strong>hit</strong></em> makes money. Lots of money.<br />
A <em><strong>flop</strong></em> does not.</p>
<p>A <em><strong>success</strong></em> is not tied to money but whether if it is successful in what it set out to do. (Tell a compelling story, entertain, etc&#8230;)<br />
A <em><strong>failure</strong></em> is unsuccessful in completing its goals.</p>
<p>How does this apply to Hollywood today? Many might argue that Hollywood is more concerned these days about having &#8220;hit films&#8221; than it is about creating film successes. A hit does not necessarily have to be a successful film. In fact, I would argue many hits today are not very successful films. How many times have you gone to see the latest blockbuster film and left the theater saying to yourself, &#8220;that was just not a good film.&#8221; And yet it made millions at the box office opening weekend. It was a hit. But as a film&#8230;it was a failure. Disney&#8217;s <em>John Carter</em> is a recent example many considered to be in the flop category. They did take a $200M write down on the film after all and Rich Ross resigned from his position at Disney over it.</p>
<p>On the contrary, there are many films that were extremely successful, but flops at the box office. Going back a bit into the 90&#8217;s, <em>Pleasantville</em> completely changed how the industry worked in Post-Production. A change still in effect today.  It was the first film to use a Digital Intermediate throughout the entire Post process for its groundbreaking color effects. Previous to this, the digital intermediate was used sparingly for FX shots only. Most people I know love the film and all of those associated with the film are very well-respected in Hollywood for their work on that film. It was truly a success in everything it set out to do and changed Hollywood for the better. But financially at the box office it was actually a flop.</p>
<h2>A New Paradigm</h2>
<p>We have to recognize that the financiers and studios today are much more interested in hits than successes. Despite his proven track record of success in film, Franco still could not get his chosen crew to get approved on this little $3 million dollar indie film. This is not hundreds of millions of dollars we are talking about here, but a very low budgeted $3M indie. And Millennium Films, according Deadline Hollywood, would apparently not approve his flop of a crew. Reading between the lines, I keep coming back to the thought that just because some on the crew had not made a $100M dollar hit film, does that necessarily mean they don&#8217;t know what they are doing on a $3M indie film? No. It doesn&#8217;t. The next Tariq Anwar (Editor &#8211; <em>The King&#8217;s Speech, American Beauty</em>), Freddie Young (Cinematographer &#8211; <em>Lawrence Of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago</em>) or Jerry Goldsmith could be among that young crew.</p>
<p>I continue to speculate here, but does anyone really think James Franco would be putting a crew together for a film he was reportedly passionate about that could not pull off what he wanted to do with this little indie? I don&#8217;t. I think the true artist in James was putting together the exact crew perfect to make THAT film&#8230;and yet because some of them were not on the Millennium short list of dept. heads in town, the financiers and bond company (who are experts at the numbers game and not artists and filmmakers) got nervous and began to butt heads with Franco. They did not trust him and his directing choices and probably lost interest in the project and were concerned it would be a flop.  Whether Millennium put the bond company up to not approving the project or not, we will never know. But Franco, out of true loyalty to his film&#8217;s vision and his chosen crew that he believed in, simply walked away. Proving to those around him that there is more to this business than making a hit.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong: The hits <em>are</em> important. They help the studio&#8217;s fund other productions. They <em>must</em> have hits. But if Hollywood is going to start making successful original films again, the films that will become iconic and remembered for generations to come, it is going to have to stop putting a &#8220;hit requirement&#8221; on everything it produces and take more chances across the board on both original stories and young, talented people. Especially the $3M indies like Franco&#8217;s GARDEN OF LAST DAYS and other &#8220;entry-level films&#8221; that are the proving grounds for the future generation of filmmakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&#8230;as composers..how does this apply to us,&#8221; you ask? Well, if you have never had a &#8220;hit&#8221; film&#8230;that does not mean you are not a successful composer. It does not mean you don&#8217;t know what you are doing or talking about. It means the folks out there that may be saying that are confused about the difference between a hit &amp; a flop and a success &amp; a failure. They are not the same. They are exclusive of one another. As a composer, you need to simply focus on making every film score you work on a success and stop worrying about whether it is attached to a hit. Does your music make the film better? Does it do its job well? Did you write a successful score? That is what you should be focusing on.</p>
<p>Hal Prince had it right.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Contemplating moving to Los Angeles for a career in film music? Here are composer Mark Smythe's observations...]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been in Los Angeles since early March 2013 on an Australia Council-funded mentorship program, absorbing all things film music and SoCal: The Good, The Bad and The Bellicose. These are my reflections so far.</p>
<h2>Transit Tantrums</h2>
<p>LA traffic on Thursday afternoon is slower than a George R. R. Martin novel&#8230;and in my case on a shuttle ride, just as gob-smacking when something finally happened. Two young girls in front were chatting excitedly about their impending adventure. Now, they weren&#8217;t exactly shrill but the conversation was audible to all. 40 minutes in, a baby-boomer businessman had an explosive outburst: &#8220;We DON&#8217;T CARE about your banal existence!&#8221;&#8230;stunned silence. A whimpered response. Simmering tension until they were dropped off&#8230;at the same hotel as Mr Explosion and his embarrassed wife. Welcome to Hollywood, girls!</p>
<p>I went to <a href="http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/bmi_participates_in_first_southeast_film_music_symposium" target="_blank">Chattanooga</a> for a weekend, as you do. I had a dawn flight out of LAX so stayed at an airport hotel the night before. Passed the concierge as a man was SCREAMING HIS HEAD OFF at a cab driver for apparently ripping him off all of $9. He kept threatening to call the cops but finally backed down.</p>
<p>On LAX-CHA flight 1, the overhead lockers filled up and a bunch of people had to check their bags through to final destinations, including myself. I didn&#8217;t care; all I needed was my iPad and headphones. Others <em>did care</em> &#8211; airline staff were hammered by well-heeled women with an inflated sense of entitlement, indignant that they wouldn&#8217;t have access to their L&#8217;Oreal travel kits and Xanax.</p>
<p>Then there was the 4-hour delay in Charlotte due to the incoming plane having &#8216;mechanical issues&#8217;. Initially it was 1 hour, then 2&#8230;etc. Was it annoying? Yes. Did it warrant the ageing rocker with a gig that night having an absolute meltdown at the check-in girl, to the point that once again the police were mentioned? NO. I wasn&#8217;t overly happy myself, but would much rather be delayed than fall out of the sky. And for a while there it did feel like the precursor to an episode of &#8216;Air Crash Investigations&#8217;.</p>
<p>SO &#8211; my point is, this was very early into my visit and I was thinking &#8216;holy crap, is this REALLY what Americans are like?&#8217; NO IT ISN&#8217;T. The symposium was FANTASTIC and when I returned to LA, the perpetually warm glow of Angelenos restored my societal faith. I guess travel brings out the best/worst in anyone and I saw some doozies of the latter kind. 99.9% of Americans are nice, genuinely interested in foreigners and usually mean it when they say &#8220;what can I do to help?&#8221;. Embrace that percentile.</p>
<h2>Location/Vehiculation</h2>
<p>Something anyone new to to town should consider carefully, well before landing. Unlike Melbourne, where I could walk 5 minutes to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Fawkner Park or my local cafe strip, LA isn&#8217;t <em>really</em> a city. Rather, it&#8217;s a vast sprawl of mini-cities connected by a web of freeways, each enclave having a unique flavour that may or may not suit your taste. Santa Monica and Venice are renowned for their beach lifestyle and slightly cooler air, but if most of your stuff&#8217;s happening Downtown or in The Valley, you&#8217;ll spend an awful lot of time on the road if you&#8217;re based out west. I knew I&#8217;d be hanging in Studio City/ Hollywood a lot, so took the time to find and pre-book the perfect AirBNB rental, smack in the middle. Slightly pricey but the location definitely saved me time and money. If AirBNB-style pads are beyond your budget, the ubiquitous CRAIGSLIST is a great place to find sub-lets, especially during summer holidays.</p>
<p>Mode of transport is a no-brainer. Unless you have incredibly helpful friends going to Point B (which I actually often do) or don&#8217;t mind spending hours traversing multi Metro routes, <em><strong>you need a car</strong></em>. If you have no choice but to get a cab somewhere, KNOW THIS: They&#8217;ll take at least 20 minutes to turn up, cost a lot and woe betide the passenger that dares to pay by credit card – even if your cab-finder app says it&#8217;s cool. I had a heated argument with a driver about this very point; in the end he was only placated when I tipped cash. If you don&#8217;t want to drive on a night out, a far better option is <a href="http://www.lyft.me" target="_blank">LYFT</a>: a smartphone app that uses your location to find and order a driver in minutes, is 20% cheaper, 100% friendlier and automatically calculates a tip-inclusive fare – ONLY from your credit card. Ok, so they have weird pink moustaches on the cars, but most drivers also stock water and snack treats : )</p>
<h2>LA Flakers — A Few Bad Players or a Team Malaise?</h2>
<p>Much has been said and written about the notoriously slow/complete lack of follow through here in Tinseltown; one friend even suggested that &#8216;yes means maybe, maybe means no and people never say no&#8217;. Hackneyed phrases are quoted with mirth by the cheerfully cynical: “let&#8217;s do lunch” &#8211; ”we&#8217;ll talk” &#8211; etc. Well. I made a conscious decision to ignore the cliché and decide for myself what the deal is. Consequently, I&#8217;ve been very surprised by the reality:</p>
<h3>Those Who&#8217;ve Flaked:</h3>
<p>&#8211; Old Aussie friends now based here, who wanted things from me on a social/industry/material level (they got 2 of the 3) but gave nothing back. Even after I said “You&#8217;re not going to flake on me are you, we will catch up?” I tried to follow up. Twice. We never caught up, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if I suddenly hear from them just before their next gig.<br />
&#8211; Potential new LA friends via Bookface; they were going to &#8216;reach out&#8217; one weekend&#8230;back in March. I tried to follow up. Twice. They de-friended me. Maybe my dry humour was misconstrued when I sent a link to that Four Tops track.</p>
<h3>Those Who Haven&#8217;t Flaked:</h3>
<p>&#8211; New composer friends, including very busy ones working on high-rating shows.<br />
&#8211; Everyone in the industry I&#8217;ve emailed/left a message for, including those I don&#8217;t know that well or haven&#8217;t met yet. I did wait 3 weeks for one reply, but this was a new contact and I time-budgeted accordingly.</p>
<p>So – I&#8217;ve been mildly affected by flakelenos at social level, but industry/music folks have treated me with more than a modicum of politeness and respect. Maybe because I haven&#8217;t burdened myself with unrealistic expectations or exuded the desperate &#8216;I want something from you&#8217; vibe that you can smell a mile away from so many young aspirants. If you come here thinking you&#8217;ll reach the summit straight away, THAT is flakey. Ed Hilary completed his first major climb 13 YEARS before scaling Everest. Patience, persistence and prudence, my friends&#8230;</p>
<h2>Event Etiquette</h2>
<p>Outside of my mentorship with <a href="http://jeffcardoni.com" target="_blank">Jeff Cardoni</a> (CSI:Miami, Wilfred) I&#8217;ve attended a swag (Australian vernacular) of workshops, screenings, seminars and masterclasses. Each event has featured high calibre composers, orchestrators, conductors, directors, or moderators and has been well conceived. Sadly, I can&#8217;t say the same for some of the <em>questions</em> that inevitably slip through the relevance cordon at these things. IT&#8217;S NOT ABOUT YOU! Do you really think that standing up so that everyone can see you when you say &#8220;Hi, my name&#8217;s [wannabe composer X] and I&#8217;ve been working on/done a lot of [gratuitous promo Y] and I work in [DAW Z],&#8221; will make them think <em>&#8220;Wow, I&#8217;m really interested in this guy and what he does, he must write like me because he uses DAW Z&#8221;</em>&#8230;? Truth is, by the time you&#8217;ve got to the actual question, half the room has tuned out (or in my case, head in hands) and the A-lister will remember your face for all the wrong reasons when you push your way through the post-event throng. Then there are those that ask questions just to be &#8216;involved&#8217; and &#8216;seen&#8217;, even if they&#8217;re &#8220;just a songwriter&#8221;&#8230;and you seriously want to punch them when they ask Thomas Newman if he &#8220;scores to picture&#8221;. Or the guy that asked Aaron Zigman if he &#8220;hums ideas in the shower&#8221;. Come on people! Be enthusiastic, but don&#8217;t be a wanker.</p>
<h2>Weeding Out the Tall Poppy</h2>
<p>Australians and New Zealanders are not known for overt self-promotion. In fact, those that say &#8220;I&#8217;m a big deal&#8221; are more often than not regarded as wankers and ostracised by their peers. This is the <strong><em>Tall Poppy Syndrome</em></strong> at work – a &#8216;cut them down&#8217; attitude towards high achievers that is uniquely endemic to Australasia. When I was younger and just out of film music school, I was brimming with enthusiasm; thrilled with any work I could get and any composer I met. Said enthusiasm combined with the mild hero-worship of a composer I spent time with somehow lead to me being perceived as a &#8216;name-dropper&#8217; by a high-ranking person in the Australian film music world. Fast forward four years to the Australian Screen Music Awards, which I was invited to by the organisation this person works for. At an industry lunch prior to the ceremony I made a concerted effort to have a pleasant conversation with this person. But when I told her I was looking forward to the awards, she asked “Are you attending legitimately?”</p>
<p>Happily, my experiences in LA have been the complete opposite. Here, it&#8217;s okay to talk about what you&#8217;ve done, what you&#8217;re doing, who you&#8217;ve connected with and what your aims are. I&#8217;ve been doing so with complete openness and honesty over the last 3 months and have been treated with more respect than I ever was in Australia. In fact, one delightful Executive Director (who holds a comparable position to my antipodean nemesis) now refers to me as her &#8216;favourite Kiwi&#8217;. And you know what? I can write about my awesome night at <a href="http://www.jeffbeal.com" target="_blank">Jeff Beal</a>&#8216;s place without fear of someone telling everybody I&#8217;ve been blowing my own trumpet. I can mention the <a href="http://www.hmmawards.org" target="_blank">Hollywood Music in Media Awards</a> competition I won &#8211; a scoring session with Mr. Beal; helping him record a 25-piece string orchestra. I can say that we exchanged CDs and that he particularly likes my choral stuff.</p>
<p>Los Angeles certainly takes some getting used to, but it&#8217;s so worth it. The top film music people I&#8217;ve met genuinely embrace talent, passion and commitment when they see it.</p>
<p>This, above all, makes me want to stick around.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Your artistic quality has been called into question. And it hurts. Might be true, might not be... but from time to time every artist, no matter the discipline, needs to check the 'ol barometer.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The film music culture over the years has a developed a bit of an elitist complex in the way we talk about the artform, leading some to believe that if you don&#8217;t have little black dots as prevalent as you have red blood cells in your veins then you must not be trying very hard. After all, we were born with this, right? It&#8217;s in our DNA.</p>
<p>Arguable, at best. A lot of people say we were born with certain aptitudes toward this gig but I would argue that while that might be true about musical intuition and a predisposition toward cognitive retention of scales  and other functional repeating mathematical sequences, quality skilled composition only comes out of tireless practice, varied experience and loads of trial and error. It&#8217;s not a far-flung theory then to assume that there could be a serious self-esteem issue working against emerging composers, dare I say even veteran ones who are willing to admit the ugly truth. Are we <em>Weenies</em>? <em>Wimps</em>? <em>Candie-asses</em>? I don&#8217;t think so. But we <em>are</em> human beings and from time to time every artist, no matter the discipline, needs to check the &#8216;ol barometer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>You&#8217;re Not a Bad Composer</h1>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you can&#8217;t seem to write anything today.</strong></h3>
<p>Writer&#8217;s block sucks. But even though the cool thing to say is &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time for that&#8221;, that still doesn&#8217;t mean it never happens. The truth is that it does happen&#8230; to everybody. You aren&#8217;t a bad composer if you are not able to write for whatever reason. You might be a <em>late</em> composer, but you aren&#8217;t a bad one.</p>
<p>How to get rid of it? Studies show that stress is the leading cause of &#8220;mental blocking&#8221; and that eliminating stress-related activities or events in your life can also lower your chances of stalling out creatively. Want to drill down further? Those same studies show that the number one cause of stress, at least among Americans, is <em>finances</em>. If that means something to you&#8230; get on it. Scale back, pare down, save more, spend less, slash and burn, budget hard, charge more — whatever you need to do, but get that financial monkey off your back, and fast. It&#8217;s a killer. Literally.</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you don&#8217;t understand the theories behind music in film.</strong></h3>
<p>It just means you have a few things to learn if you are to be as effective a film music writer as you can be. You might already be an effective composer, but as a film composer you have to intimately understand the marriage of music and drama. If you don&#8217;t, then you are missing a huge piece of the puzzle as a talented composer looking to crack this particular medium. Obviously you aren&#8217;t a bad composer if this skill still eludes you, but I&#8217;ll warn you that without it you are always going to be composing from a <em>defensive</em> posture — meaning that whatever is thrown at you, you&#8217;ll either need to be lucky enough to intuitively feel it and magically hit that bullseye on the first dart throw or you&#8217;ll need to study up every time out, whether that&#8217;s through asking seasoned vets or &#8220;listening&#8221; to seasoned vets via Netflix streaming. Point being, you&#8217;ll always be playing &#8220;catch up&#8221;. That game gets old fast, slows you down, and eventually begins to erode your confidence.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t worry&#8230; it&#8217;s an easy fix. All you have to do is find a way to absorb the principles and theories behind drama. Extended viewing and note-taking can do it, but so will auditing a few film appreciation courses at the local community college. Or reading a stack of good books on the subject. I&#8217;d recommend starting with Earle Hagen&#8217;s <a href="http://amzn.com/0882844474" target="_blank"><em>Advanced Techniques for Film Scoring</em></a>. Hagen&#8217;s book is grossly outdated in its purview of technology, but the score analysis and score/script interaction is second to none. If you really want to steam your head, pick up Fred Karlin&#8217;s classic brick of a book <a href="http://amzn.com/0415941369" target="_blank"><em>On the Track</em></a>. Often referred to as &#8220;the film scoring bible&#8221;, <em>On the Track</em> offers probably the most extensive perspective on various approaches to dramatic writing for the medium of film.</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you&#8217;ve been rejected, fired or ignored. A lot.</strong></h3>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean you suck. Not necessarily, anyway. Although, a case could be made that if you got so far as to pitch for the gig it won&#8217;t matter if you suck anyway because you obviously have what it takes to get through the door. Any well-heeled major player knows <em>that ain&#8217;t easy</em>. But being told that &#8220;your music just isn&#8217;t what we&#8217;re looking for&#8221; is tough. What&#8217;s tougher, though, is hearing that time and again. And even still, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you are a bad composer. You&#8217;ll have to gauge this one for yourself and use your best and most honest evaluations of your output, but there have been plenty of people — hundreds — who&#8217;ve been turned down dozens upon dozens of times before they ever scored a note to picture and even more than that who&#8217;ve been successful and then been told they were washed up, irrelevant, too old, too young, too inexperienced, too expensive, too high-profile, not high-profile enough&#8230; you name it. Point being: Rejection happens and you have to learn to accept it and deal with it appropriately.</p>
<p>There are many ways to face rejection, accept whatever truths come with it, and then discard the parts that don&#8217;t matter. One way is to be sure that you have the most healthy self-esteem you can have outside of your role as a creative person. I married a wonderful woman whom my every heartbeat pounds for. So, I don&#8217;t live every moment to be a composer or to even be a musician. It&#8217;s certainly a gigantic part of who I am at my core, but there are things and people in my life who are more important than any of this will ever be. I&#8217;m not alone in this feeling. Ask anyone who is creative and probably over the age of thirty. The secondary things in life, you realize over time, matter very little. Success takes on a whole new definition when love, children, family, and even the closest friends take root in your life as a middle-aged person. I spend a huge majority of my time trying to hip younger people who are ready to jump off the cliff of career suicide to this fact. When you get rejected, it&#8217;s not a rejection of <em>you as a person</em>, it&#8217;s simply that the timing of your artistic expression and that of the source material don&#8217;t align. That&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s the wrinkle of cosmic scheduling. You could bring the same set of demo cues to the next meeting and have the biggest film in history on your hands. Nobody knows. But whatever the case, rejection should only hit your art, not your heart. It&#8217;s just not worth it and it never ever lasts anyway, so why devote the emotional bandwidth?</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you don&#8217;t know how to read music.</strong></h3>
<p>Clearly, you will be at major and immediate disadvantage if you don&#8217;t read music and you are trying to break into the scene. Not only does this hamper your speed and agility as the point person for the music department on a production, but it will also hurt you as a potential candidate for an apprenticeship — the avenue by which a lot of film composers get their start. Like it or not, and argue all you want, but the film music business still thrives and depends on people who can read dots on a page. Period. Whether you are a musician at a session, an orchestrator sorting out lines for the composer, a copyist handling last-minute changes, or the composer yourself, you will need to read often. Written music comprehension is to a composer what the interpreting of blueprints is to an architect. Not knowing how to read the architectural drawings on the house you are building will be an unmitigated disaster. Imagine being a non-reading composer on the scoring stage and having to quickly change a lead-line for your director, transpose it in your head, and rattle it off to your 1st chair trumpet or clarinetist. Can you imagine? Well, please do&#8230; because that exact scenario is not a rare experience for the in-the-trenches film composer.</p>
<p>Does not reading make you a <em>bad</em> composer? Of course not. Even a few top-tier composers in the game started out just humming their melodies to an orchestrator. But before long, almost all of them learned to read and write at least functionally. Need to brush up? Take some private lessons; there are hundreds of teachers in LA, NYC, and London who will take you on as a private student and bring you up to functional and workable levels in no time. Don&#8217;t be embarrassed by your inability to read notes; not all composers who are working today are ace readers, either, and no matter how good you are, I promise you your musicians will always be ten times better anyway. But even still, having that very basic ability in your skill set will remove what is probably the biggest hurdle to self-confidence as a composer. It is your job as the captain of this ship to have a solid grasp of the fundamentals. This is as fundamental as it gets.</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you don&#8217;t live in a music mecca.</strong></h3>
<p>There you are&#8230; in Delaware. Don&#8217;t worry. Geographical misfortune does not a bad composer make. There&#8217;s been a lot of talk in the last decade about geography and how it correlates to the level of sophistication of a composer, implying that the farther away you are from a major music center the less &#8220;dedicated&#8221; you must be to your craft. Obviously that&#8217;s bullshit. It doesn&#8217;t matter where you live, your talents are your talents. Now, how accessible your talents are to those who need them&#8230; well, that&#8217;s another matter entirely.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re not a <em>bad</em> composer if you live in Cornwall. Still living with the folks in Texarkana? No problem. Never underestimate the powerful combo of a gigabit Internet connection and a fair amount of good old-fashioned hustle. You can accomplish a lot with an IMDbPro account, a well thought-out demo reel and a cell phone. But if you are determined to be in the thick of the film world, the brick and mortar studios are all still standing in Los Angeles. Film and TV seem to be the only industries who haven&#8217;t figured out that the world is flat like the video game industry has. They are making strides in that direction, but they aren&#8217;t there yet. Post-production on films and shows happens in LA.</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; just because somebody says you are.</strong></h3>
<p>Human beings are strange creatures. We love to kick our wounded. I don&#8217;t know what it is, but people will love you when it&#8217;s easy to and hate you when it&#8217;s easier. There is nothing that will take the wind out of your sails more than negative feedback from colleagues. Complete strangers? Whatevs. But colleagues&#8230; That&#8217;s a tough knife in the gut. And there are those out there who are self-loathing enough to let you have it. Believe me. As I&#8217;ve just finished a very personal project, the barbs from the people I figured would lob them last have found their mark. And for a while, I internalized every one, taking it apart and searching for where I&#8217;d gone wrong. But then I realized that those people are not my audience. Do you make music for other musicians? I sure don&#8217;t. So what was I worried about?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: The people who love what you do love it because it does something for them. It fills something in them. It cures what&#8217;s ailing, if only for five minutes. That is your <em>audience</em>. <em>The</em> <em>fans</em>. Not the freaks&#8230; <em>the fans</em>. The freaks are just freaking. They need something to freak about so that they don&#8217;t have to keep staring at their own work. There will be people who &#8220;get&#8221; what you do and there will be people who just don&#8217;t and never will. Just accept that those people aren&#8217;t the people you are doing this for and they likely never will be. Don&#8217;t read your comment feed. Never punch down. Even the biggest stars in entertainment get railed by the folks who are sitting at home doing nothing. If you happen to convert a non-believer through consistent output that ultimately changes their mind, awesome&#8230; You&#8217;re lucky. That doesn&#8217;t happen often. Take great care of them and don&#8217;t abuse their commitment to your art by following up with a piece of crap. But if you never do, remember who you are playing to: <em>Your fans</em>. The dedicated few. Your niche. Your tribe. Your supporters. The people who will join your mailing list, share your content in their social circles, attend your panel discussions, and email occasionally to tell you they &#8220;enjoyed this last one&#8221;. That is the person you are working for. That is where your mental bandwidth deserves allocation. Not thinking about how to <em>get new fans</em>&#8230;. but thinking about how to care for the ones who are here already. That&#8217;s an endgame that matters.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Composer Brian Ralston puts a different spin on how you sell yourself as a composer in today's over-saturated market.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was talking with a friend, who, on behalf of his brother, was asking for advice on getting into the industry.  Specifically, his brother is the musician in the family while my friend is a more traditional businessman who sells product. My pal asked me, &#8220;How do you determine what to charge? I know that in my industry I have to do an analysis of what a product costs me to produce and how much profit margin I need to make to survive. If a music mix takes a certain number of hours and you can determine its cost to show the client, why can you not get people to pay for that?&#8221; This inevitably led to the train of thought that <em>you charge what you are worth </em>— a topic we have discussed here at SCOREcast many times in the past. But upon further discussion, I determined that in advising his brother on how to charge for his work, there was a fundamental problem in their approach. They were focused on selling the wrong product.</p>
<p>What Are You Selling?</p>
<p>Answer this question for yourself. As a composer, what product are you selling? Think about it. Answer honestly in your head before you read on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&#8230;(Queue Merv Griffin&#8217;s &#8220;Jeopardy&#8221; theme)&#8230;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you answer &#8220;music?&#8221; Did you answer &#8220;a film score?&#8221; Did you answer &#8220;fully produced tracks?&#8221; &#8220;Original compositions?&#8221; Well&#8230; you are wrong on all accounts. What is the product you are selling? The product you are selling is YOU!</p>
<p>It is a fundamental shift in how you look at your business. It&#8217;s why some composers can charge seven figures and perhaps you can not — those composers are worth more. But if you are frustrated because you feel the fully produced tracks on your demo are just as polished and unique as those composer&#8217;s then you are taking your eye off the ball. It is NOT about your music. It is about <em>YOU</em>. <em>You</em> are the product. ALL of <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>Of course you produce music, but that is only part of it. You also make the director feel like his or her movie was the best thing made this year. You also solve problems with a positive and professional approach that makes people want to be around you for months at a time on a project. You also communicate well and deliver on time and on budget. There is so much more to it.</p>
<p>The challenge in setting a price for your music is really just determining what <em>YOU</em> are worth to the client, rather than what your <em>music</em> is worth. A Blu-Ray can be purchased at the nearest store for about $15-$20 USD. There is a value assessment to that product that the market has determined and can sustain. But with us, our value changes — sometimes overnight. If your movie hits #1 in the country, all of a sudden you&#8217;ll be worth more. It is not like your music is any different today than it was yesterday before your film hit number one at the box office, but the value of having you on a future project is now much more valuable to a producer or director. It has nothing to do with your music.</p>
<p>The honest truth: If you are having a hard time getting your fee up it is because the industry does not feel <em>YOU</em> are worth that. If they felt you were worth the money, they would find the money to cover your fee. It also plays into <a title="Deane Ogden: Founder of SCOREcast" href="http://www.deaneogden.com/" target="_blank">Deane Ogden</a>&#8216;s frequent posts about the <em><a title="DeaneOgden.com | The Culture of Free" href="http://www.deaneogden.com/2012/02/23/the-culture-of-free/" target="_blank">culture of free</a></em>. If we agree to free gigs, we are simply affirming to the industry that we are worth&#8230; nothing.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the next time you re-evaluate your business plan and try to determine what your fee is, remember what it is that you are actually trying to sell. Also remember that you are not a <em>composer looking for a job</em>, you are a <em>business looking for clients</em>. It is a subtle distinction but an important one. It shifts the dynamic of where you sit on the ladder with your clients.</p>
<p>The product is not your music — the product is <em>YOU!</em></p>
<p>[sncallout type=&#8221;announcement&#8221;]<em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Leave your thoughts on this below. I would love to hear your take on what makes YOU a valuable product to your clients.</span> — Brian</strong></em>[/sncallout]</p>

		<description><![CDATA[SoundCloud is a versatile platform for composers and sound content creators of all kinds. Oliver Sadie goes inside to bring you the low-down.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1354" title="SoundCloud_logo-800x500_orange" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/01/800x500_orange-640x400.png" alt="" width="640" height="400" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/01/800x500_orange-640x400.png 640w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/01/800x500_orange-389x243.png 389w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/01/800x500_orange.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><a href="http://soundcloud.com/" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a> is a versatile and effective platform for composers and sound content creators of all kinds, and is arguably the next big thing in online audio. Over the last year and a half I have invested hundreds of hours on SoundCloud and would like to spend a few minutes with you to share a few nuggets I&#8217;ve picked up along the way, that may help you as a composer, and that may shed some light on the community aspects of the service, as well.</p>
<h3>Ten Point Briefing</h3>
<ol>
<li>SoundCloud is an audio platform for sharing, promotion and collaboration, with its own social networking framework.</li>
<li>SoundCloud is accessed via desktop web browsers, embedded webpage widgets and smartphone apps.</li>
<li>SoundCloud began as a music file sharing service in Berlin in 2007, by Alexander Ljung and Eric Wahlforss, growing from 1 million members in May 2010 to 9 million members in December 2011.</li>
<li>Members can upload sound files in all common formats, with public or limited visibility, downloadability and all common licensing options, Buy links and a vanity URL, for example soundcloud.com/the-chemical-brothers.</li>
<li>Tracks can have players embedded on external websites with flexible appearance and browser compatibility options.</li>
<li>Members can follow other members, provide feedback via timed comments, mark tracks as favourites, keep abreast of other member activity on a dashboard, and create and join groups.</li>
<li>Detailed stats are available, showing who played your track, where, when, how often, and who downloaded or saved your track to their favourites list.</li>
<li>SoundCloud is well integrated with Twitter, Facebook and other online social networks. At the Facebook f8 conference in September 2011, Facebook announced a strategic technology partnership with SoundCloud, effectively providing SoundCloud embedded exposure to over 800 million Facebook users.</li>
<li>Membership is free but there are premium accounts ranging from €29 to €500 offering various levels of storage, stats, widgets, support and other options.</li>
<li>Finally, and crucially, SoundCloud is a community.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Who Uses SoundCloud?</h3>
<p>Essentially, sound content creators of all types, and listeners of all tastes. From dance music producers like Deadmau5, Skrillex and Swedish House Mafia to A-list pop stars like Lady Gaga, Radiohead and Bjork, from indie singer/songwriters to podcasters, comedians and even newspapers like The Economist, and of course composers.</p>
<p>I asked a handful of film and television composers to share their experiences of SoundCloud, starting with LA-based Kerry Muzzey, who enjoys the community-oriented learning and social aspects of SoundCloud:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I have fallen in love with SoundCloud. I&#8217;ve enjoyed it not only for the many musical discoveries I&#8217;ve made but also for the ability to interact with other composers. I love that so many have been willing to share their tech tips and secret recipes. Sure, it&#8217;s a really simple and slick demo-hosting site: but take some time to go a little deeper and you&#8217;ll be surprised at the community you&#8217;ll discover: these are people who are passionate about music and about the beauty of sound.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Sean Beeson from Ohio has over 400,000 track plays on SoundCloud and gains from the marketing aspects it offers:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I use SoundCloud to gauge the success of my online marketing campaigns. I can see what sites people are accessing my music from, where in the world they are listening from, and what music the are listening to. It helps me to cater my sets to what music is most listened to in the hopes that I can gain greater exposure for my work.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Geographically, members are spread across the world in roughly the following order: US, UK, Germany, rest of Europe, Canada, Russia, Australia, Japan, rest of world.</p>
<p>UK-based Marie-Anne Fischer, film and television composer and chapter director of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/composium/" target="_blank">SCOREcast: London</a>, has experience with a number of online music platforms including ReverbNation. Marie-Anne shared a little about using SoundCloud for professional showreel and private sharing purposes:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I discovered SoundCloud <em>about 10 months ago </em>when I started writing demos for Sonokinetic because they use SoundCloud to post their demos. I like the direct connection and simplicity. SoundCloud is becoming more interesting to me as I have found more film and media composers on SoundCloud than I had on ReverbNation. I like the group features on SoundCloud where there is no clutter. I tend to be using SoundCloud more recently to link prospective clients to my showreel and being able to share private tracks is a great feature.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Given the fact that there are over 9 million members, of course not all members are professionals in the line of work they present on SoundCloud and membership is arguably weighted towards amateur enthusiasts, but that does not detract from its usefulness in professional spheres.</p>
<h3>Can SoundCloud Help Your Career?</h3>
<p>SCOREcast: London&#8217;s own Dominik Johnson, world music production specialist:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>SoundCloud, for me, is one of the best community music tools online at the moment for the pro musician / composer / producer. I know the audio quality on my music (typically 48kHz/24bit) can be lost with some of the upload compression, but to me, that’s a price worth paying. A few months ago an independent film director from Berlin got in touch after hearing a few of my works on there, we got chatting on there, then we starting having Skype calls – and BOOM! I’ve been commissioned to write some tracks for his upcoming feature documentary – and yes, his production team does have a budget for the music.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Dominik touched on a point above with regards to upload/playback quality, which I&#8217;ll explore in the Technical section further below.</p>
<p>I know of one case where the SoundCloud user was not necessarily the <em>beneficiary</em> of a career opportunity. LA-based film composer, orchestrator and conductor Deon Vozov has this story:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>For me as a composer, no, there&#8217;s nothing that&#8217;s happened on SoundCloud without my initiation that&#8217;s led to a contract. However, because I also do some small music supervision work, I have FOUND tracks on SoundCloud and gotten them placed in projects. The first few were free, but there are starting to be licensing gigs that pay a little something, help build reels, and feel more dignified. And believe me, it is much more fun to approach people with money than with &#8220;it&#8217;ll be good for your reel&#8221; statements of questionable accuracy.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Deon continues with an interesting point about the depth of SoundCloud&#8217;s penetration into the upper echelons of film-making:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>My clients seem to fall into two categories: producers and directors who are very, or at least comfortably, familiar with SoundCloud but not very well-funded yet, and producers and directors who’ve never heard of SoundCloud but can cut those juicy checks we all love to then spend getting the job done.</em></p>
<p><em> In other words, my experience has been that it&#8217;s still not an industry standard in audio post production. By gently guiding clients towards it, however, I think it will become more so.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Offering more insights than I could ever have hoped for, Deon goes on to make a point about visual versus audio impact of a demo reel:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>That said, it&#8217;s not selfless support of SoundCloud that has led me to steer clients to the site. Rather, I like to link even initially skittish clients, and potential clients, to private sets here because <strong>it gets them focused on listening with their ears rather than their eyes </strong>[emphasis mine]. </em></p>
<p><em>Everyone wants video links, and they will tell you with a straight face that they&#8217;re really listening to the music, and they really do believe that they&#8217;re telling the truth when they say that. But the reality is that these are highly visual, highly visually sensitive, and highly visually creative people experiencing audio tracks by way of how they feel about picture. </em></p>
<p><em>It is possible to separate picture from music, of course, but difficult, and it will always imprint indelibly upon the track. That can work in one&#8217;s favor (an expensive car spot, for example) or against it (a feature that suffers a malaise of some kind or other). By sending clients to a simple, easy-to-navigate, custom-built set, they have an interactive experience and can jump around in the set to find what they want to discuss and, if they&#8217;re bold enough to create an account, they can even leave timed comments for us to discuss in relation to their project.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Many of the responses in this section came to me as a result of engaging with the community on SoundCloud directly by publishing a track inviting my followers to share their stories as timed comments. Here&#8217;s a handful of other stories, in brief:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Uploaded 1st track, surprised by response. Uploaded more. Got made Soundclouder of the Day and then featured on SoundCloud <a title="SoundCloud Tour Page" href="http://soundcloud.com/tour" target="_blank">tour page</a>. Label emailed me and now I have two releases out.<br />
— Russell Knight, London</em></p>
<p><em>A few months ago Norwegian Landscape photographer Ole Salomonsen approached me via SoundCloud, asking if he could use my track &#8216;Counting Stars&#8217; on his latest vid of the Northern Lights. My first piece of paid work.<br />
</em><em>— Mei-Ling Grey, London</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Amidst the success stories, two cautionary tales emerged:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I believe I did *not* get a gig because of the music in my SoundCloud profile. I was considered during the final round of applicants, and <em>when asked for a portfolio I </em>directed them to my SoundCloud profile. Something like two days later I found out they gave the job to someone else. </em><em>This has led me to reassess the quality of the work I upload to SoundCloud, even though it could be that the work I have on my SoundCloud is quite different from the piece I made for that job.<br />
</em><em>— Rodrigo Hernández, Mexico City</em></p>
<p><em>I signed a contract with a company called [redacted] who have a group here on SoundCloud about three months ago. I had to go to a notary and everything, alas I have not heard from them since and they don&#8217;t reply to my emails.</em><br />
<em>— Andy Carter, Cornwall, UK</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The insights I&#8217;ve gained from these last two are to keep one&#8217;s SoundCloud profile tidy and focused on the target market, and to know who you&#8217;re dealing with.</p>
<p>One reason I&#8217;m able to share this article with you today is that my own case is potentially one more success story to emerge from SoundCloud, but this is not about me so I&#8217;ll save that for the end.</p>
<h3>How SoundCloud Compares to Other Audio Platforms</h3>
<p>In the user content audio hosting space, SoundCloud competes with, among others, BandCamp, ReverbNation and Myspace.</p>
<p><strong>BandCamp</strong> is mainly focused on allowing independent artists to sell their work, and are funded in part on a commission basis. Users can customise the look and feel of their music pages and have their tracks downloadable in many formats. BandCamp has attracted some commercially established artists including Amanda Palmer to abandon their labels and self-promote (interestingly, Amanda Palmer also has a <a title="SoundCloud: Amanda Palmer" href="http://soundcloud.com/amandapalmer">SoundCloud account</a>).</p>
<p>Jeremiah Pena, SCOREcaster, says:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I like Bandcamp. I don&#8217;t get as many track plays as Soundcloud, but it&#8217;s my main method of selling music to the general public, which SoundCloud doesn&#8217;t seem to do very well. It&#8217;s also very useful for building email lists, since you can have people supply an email address for free downloads. And it&#8217;s free, with no major limits like the free version of SoundCloud. I&#8217;m able to put a lot more music than I could there.</em></p>
<p><em>I do find SoundCloud much better for getting feedback and it has very good community features (commenting, groups, etc.) that Bandcamp doesn&#8217;t have.</em></p>
<p><em>— Jeremiah Pena, Film Composer, Utah</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In terms of usefulness to composers, BandCamp may serve a function to sell original soundtracks if the production licensing terms permit, but since BandCamp does not offer embedded players, the composer would have to set up a specific BandCamp page outside their main website, which may not be a desirable solution for those who like a one-stop-shop approach to their web presence.</p>
<p><strong>ReverbNation </strong>aims to provide a collaboration and communication platform as well as music hosting for independent artists, and have an embeddable player.</p>
<p>SCOREcast&#8217;s Marie-Anne Fischer knows ReverbNation well, having ruled the London and UK Classical charts with a regular #1 spot. In her words:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I started using ReverbNation in 2009 because I was able to link my playlist to my Facebook profile as an app. I wasn&#8217;t particularly interested at the time in having a Facebook fan page, so this was a great alternative. Unfortunately Facebook subsequently took away the ReverbNation band playlist feature from personal Facebook pages. &#8216;My Band&#8217; feature could only feature in a fan or group page but I was still able to use the widgets and apps for posting new tracks.</em></p>
<p><em>ReverbNation has been great for meeting musicians and I have already collaborated with a couple of them. During 2009 and 2010 I made great use of my ReverbNation site, my website is linked to my profile which I pay for annually.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Marie-Anne also offers us a comparison with her SoundCloud experience:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You can personalise ReverbNation&#8217;s profile which you can&#8217;t on SoundCloud but that hasn&#8217;t stopped me from using SoundCloud.</em></p>
<p><em>I like the statistics SoundCloud collects and provides me and also their feature where people can favour a track and leave a comment.</em></p>
<p><em>The great big difference between SoundCloud and ReverbNation is that SoundCloud is purely functional and works well where as on ReverbNation you can add your personal touch to your profile, link music to multiple stores, integrate with other websites, create newsletters, blogs and apps are only but a few of their features.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Marie-Anne is right about SoundCloud being less customisable than ReverbNation, which takes a modular approach to the profile page with a lot of control over content and branding. On SoundCloud, personalisation can be applied to player widgets for website-matching style and colour scheme, for user dropbox page branding, for linking other profiles like Twitter, Facebook etc. and for essential items like profile image and an HTML-enabled description area.</p>
<p>In terms of how that translates into commercial opportunities, I would argue that for a composer it is the presentation of your professional website that is more important than the presentation of your profile on the audio hosting website, but that can be debated in the comments below.</p>
<p>One other factor to consider is the service value available to non-paying customers. Although ReverbNation&#8217;s free account allows more tracks to be hosted than SoundCloud&#8217;s free account, the size of each track is limited to 8MB which forces lossy upload format; the longer the track the lossier it has to be to fit into 8MB.</p>
<p><strong>Myspace</strong> does not make for great headlines these days, having been sold to News Corporation for $580 million in 2005 and then bought by Specific Media and Justin Timberlake in 2011 for $35 million. But as a music hosting social networking site with 33 million unique US visitors in August 2011, it cannot be ignored in this comparison.</p>
<p>Oxford-based soundtrack composer, electronica producer and SCOREcast reader &#8220;The Unfinished&#8221; (Matt Bowdler) shared his experience with me:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Myspace, I haven&#8217;t used for a long time. It may have improved, but I think it has been superceded by SoundCloud from a music hosting perspective and Facebook from a community perspective. The options were limited (I think ten tracks was the maximum) and it just got incredibly spammy. Endless messages from people who were plugging their latest track or gig that was almost always a genre that bore no relevenace to what you were doing. Quite a bit of spam from Myspace themselves as well. Put quite simply, there isn&#8217;t anything that Myspace does that isn&#8217;t done better elsewhere.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I think Matt&#8217;s view is shared by many in the music community including myself: That Myspace is not necessarily the most strategic technology partner for a professional composer. If you disagree, please share your experience in the comments below.</p>
<h3>Technical Considerations</h3>
<p>How do you get your SoundCloud tracks on your web page? SoundCloud makes it simple.</p>
<p>You can embed SoundCloud widgets in several sizes and styles, with both Flash and HTML5 options. HTML5 is more mobile browser-friendly, especially on iPhones and iPads which can&#8217;t play Flash, but some older browsers (e.g. IE6) can&#8217;t view HTML5.</p>
<p>To embed a track or set, use the Share menu item at top left of the track or set to access the widget options, customise to taste.</p>
<p>Here are some Flash and HTML5 examples of embedded track players.</p>

<h4>The main technical issues reported by professional SoundCloud users are well-known and steps have been taken to address them.</h4>
<p><em>1. SoundCloud playback is compressed at 128kbps, which many audiophiles can discern distinctly from studio-quality uncompressed recording.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In previous email exchanges, SoundCloud staff let me know that they&#8217;re always thinking of and considering ways to make the experience better for both creators and listeners. One way for creators to offer higher quality is to enable downloads for their sounds so listeners can access the file in its original quality. They&#8217;re regularly discussing this topic internally and are considering changes in the future.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In the meantime, SoundCloud seems to remain the platform of choice for many sound libraries&#8217; demo tracks, including Sonokinetic, 8dio and others, which is a good indicator that the quality, although not perfect, is widely acceptable for professional demo purposes.</p>
<p><em>2. Flash-based SoundCloud players are subject to the inherent stability and compatibility issues of Flash, particularly where smartphones often have trouble showing Flash controls.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">SoundCloud recently released HTML5 versions of their embeddable widgets, addressing both the stability problem and making it compatible with most smartphones and mobile devices including iPhones and iPads. The new HTML5 widgets have been well-received and many say better looking than their Flash predecessors.</p>
<p><em>3. Some users reported that the encoding produced glitchy playback, particularly in high frequency ranges and at high volume levels.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Up until recently, SoundCloud advised: &#8220;This rarely happens but if it does, we suggest uploading in 320kbps 44.1kHz with at least -3dB of headroom&#8221; but a recent discovery has revealed that this is no longer required.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FLAC is the recommended upload format for optimal playback quality, but this may not be ideal for download purposes and is probably best-suited for playback-only tracks (non-downloadable). For people who would prefer to have their files available for download, the higher the quality of the lossy file they upload, the higher quality the encoding will be.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The <a title="SoundCloud: Help" href="http://help.soundcloud.com/customer/portal/articles/94796" target="_blank">Help Page</a> on this topic offers this advice:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Sometimes our transcoding system can create audio artifacts, as we transcode all tracks to 128 kbps mp3 for streaming playback. Uploading a lossless or high-quality lossy file will usually reduce these to a minimum, but unfortunately there&#8217;s not much we can do for the handful of individual tracks that are still affected.</em></p>
<p><em>If you choose to make your track downloadable though, the version users can download will be an exact copy of the version you uploaded, without any transcoding.</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is an important point with regards to using SoundCloud for track sharing between yourself and the film production co, or for demo or collaborative purposes: <strong>The track you download is the exact track that was uploaded, regardless of the playback encoding</strong>. So you can happily share your 192kHz 32-bit float wav file if that tickles your fancy, in full trust that that is how it will be received. You can also do so in complete privacy without violating your NDA.</p>
<p><em>4. SoundCloud has experienced unscheduled downtime in the past.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For 24 hours in October 2011, SoundCloud fell victim to an aggressive DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack leading to slow response times and occasional periods of downtime.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">No data was lost in the attack and no user profile security was compromised, but better measures have since been put in place to defend against future attacks of that nature. Unfortunately, no website is untouchable from such an attack attempt.</p>
<h3>My SoundCloud Story</h3>
<p>I joined SoundCloud in August 2010 and from the start had a revelatory and inspirational experience, so much so that by New Year&#8217;s Day 2011 I resolved to turn my life-long passion and hobby into a career. This I knew would be a long path but one that would hopefully be rewarding at every step of the way, and as 2011 passed by, I reflected on those intentions in confidence that things were finally moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>My first steps on SoundCloud were like most others—a one-way path of uploading music and hoping it would be heard and liked by someone, somewhere, just as most creative artists hope for their own art to be observed and appreciated. It only really happened for me when I realised that it was more than a music hosting site but a community as well.</p>
<p>And so I started engaging in-depth with other people&#8217;s music—going through their entire track lists to understand their own creative processes and leaving comments and, drawing on my own experience, leaving constructive feedback along the way. This revealed the reciprocal nature of SoundCloud interaction when all of a sudden my own tracks started drawing a lot of attention.</p>
<h4>Community</h4>
<p>The third stage of my SoundCloud involvement began in June when I decided to try tapping into the collective creativity of the SoundCloud community.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first crowd-sourcing project was extremely simple: &#8220;I invite you to suggest a name for this track&#8221;. SoundCloud staff noticed this, thought it was a cool idea, and tweeted it to their then 80,000 followers. My track got absolutely bombed by name suggestions and the winning title and subtitle were really well-suited to the track (<a href="http://soundcloud.com/oliversadie/namethis">White Light Rendezvous: For Those Who Follow</a>). With around 200 followers at the time, I then gained another 200 or so on the back of that mini-project.</li>
<li>The second project was a little more ambitious. I played a 9 minute piano improvisation and called it &#8220;I invite you to suggest an orchestral composition with timed comments on this track.&#8221; This got a lot of attention too with comments like &#8220;a harp arpeggio phrase for next 8 bars&#8221; and after about 100 comments I spent a month composing those elements over the original piano improv. I called the resulting track <a href="http://soundcloud.com/oliversadie/scs">&#8220;SoundCloud Sinfonietta: You Composed This&#8221;</a> which quickly racked up over 5,000 plays and was a finalist in the <a href="http://www.g-technology.eu/competition/">G-Technology Europe Driven Creativity Awards</a>.</li>
<li>The third project is still on-going and is called <a href="http://soundcloud.com/oliversadie/your-tune">&#8220;Your Tune&#8221;</a> where I invited followers to share a 20-second solo melody and composed a full-length orchestral or band instrumental track using the submitted melody.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Career Break</h4>
<p>As well as the community projects I run on SoundCloud, I also produce a lot of original work and get involved in many collaborations. Through a friend on SoundCloud, one of my original tracks <a href="http://soundcloud.com/oliversadie/ochre-threads-piano">&#8220;Ochre Threads&#8221;</a> was heard by an independent filmmaker in LA, also on SoundCloud, who is working on his 3rd feature-length film and wanted to use the track for a particular scene.</p>
<p>The same filmmaker then spotted a track I released in December 2011—<a href="http://soundcloud.com/oliversadie/of-valour">&#8220;Of Valour&#8221;</a>—and on the strength of that alone gave me the opportunity to score the entire feature-length film, due for release in Summer 2012.</p>
<p>This is potentially the career break I&#8217;ve dreamed of for many years and could be my ticket to full-time paid filmscoring work in the future.</p>
<h3>SoundCloud Communities</h3>
<p>Apart from members who used underhanded spam-like tactics to drive playcount and visibility, the most active and successful accounts are those of people who take the time to listen and provide feedback to other SoundClouders. The communities thrive in the timed comments, the track favouritings, the collaborations and in groups, especially those which have forum-like chat areas. There are also regular live meetups across the world, like <a href="http://blog.soundcloud.com/2011/10/13/soundcloud-global-meetup-day-review/">this one</a> in October 2011, which Yoko Ono got involved in too.</p>
<p>Naturally I prefer an organically grown community to one built on spam and follow-backs, and contributed <a href="http://soundcloud.com/101/community-building">&#8220;How to Grow Your SoundCloud Community&#8221;</a> to SoundCloud HQ, which they keep on the front page of the user guide here: <a href="http://soundcloud.com/101">soundcloud.com/101</a></p>
<p>The SoundCloud community is well supported by dedicated community teams with staff in Berlin, London and San Francisco, headed by <a title="Europa Award Winners 2011" href="http://theeuropas.com/2011/11/peer-index-wins-the-grand-prix-as-the-europas-awards-drifts-eastwards/" target="_blank">Europa Award-Winner</a> <strong><a title="David Noël" href="http://david-noel.com/" target="_blank">David Noël</a></strong>. The team actively promotes community projects via their <a title="SoundCloud Blog" href="http://blog.soundcloud.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>, <a title="Facebook: SoundCloud" href="http://www.facebook.com/soundcloud" target="_blank">Facebook</a> page (500,000+ followers) and <a title="Twitter: SoundCloud" href="http://twitter.com/SoundCloud">Twitter</a> account (150,000+ followers), for example a global project collecting translations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in as many languages as possible.</p>
<p>One very charming aspect of the <strong><a title="SoundCloud: Community Team" href="http://soundcloud.com/community-team" target="_blank">SoundCloud Community Team</a></strong> is their daily SoundClouder Of The Day nomination, where a member is singled out for their community activity or other unique attribute that deserves recognition. SCOTD alumni are then often contacted for input on community questions and feedback, and are given a little boost in follower-ship by means of a shoutout on their social networks.</p>
<p>&#8220;This Week in SoundCloud&#8221; is another community project highlighting interesting discoveries across the &#8216;Cloud, in podcast format on a weekly basis (incidentally, the jingle for this podcast was written by me and 2 other SoundClouders).</p>
<p>There is a lot to the SoundCloud platform, it is not just an audio widget on your demo page. I&#8217;ll end where I began: SoundCloud is a versatile and effective platform for composers and sound content creators of all kinds. It is arguably the next big thing in online audio, and maybe most important&#8230; it <em>is</em> a community.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Attention spans are short and very demanding. If you want to make your art into a business, you have to brand yourself and then market your art. No getting away from it.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For some reason, we creative types seem to take an instant dislike to the notion of Branding and Marketing.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t be quantified or packaged. We&#8217;re artists, darling. Our art speaks for itself. All true&#8230; but all the art out there is vying equally for all of your potential clients&#8217; attentions. And those attention spans are short and very demanding. If you want to make your art into a business, i.e. make money at it, you&#8217;ve no choice &#8211; you have to brand yourself and then market your art. No getting away from it.</p>
<p>And as film composers and sound designers, we&#8217;re usually selling art that&#8217;s <em>yet to be created</em>. So what might be a more effective overall marketing strategy is to think of how we can sell ourselves, our persona, our fun-to-work-with-ness, our attitudes to career and life, how you and I collaborating together will without a doubt create something more awesome than we could possibly have done separately.</p>
<p>So marketing is very important to the film music composer or sound designer. But it need not be boring, time-consuming or expensive. Marketing for us film sound creators can be quick, easy, painless, fun, interesting, and very cheap if you take a little time to think creatively about it. Even if you&#8217;re totally anti-marketing/branding/selling your soul, you&#8217;re probably doing some of it already without even realising it (I&#8217;ve talked about some of this in <em><a href="../../../2010/06/heather-fenoughty-personality-branding.html"><strong>Personality Branding</strong></a></em>).</p>
<p><strong>And</strong>&#8230; if it sells more of your work or your services, what you complainin&#8217; about? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Here are all of the ways I can think of (so far) that a film music composer may market themselves. I&#8217;ve separated them out into whether I&#8217;ve used them or not, and how useful they&#8217;ve been up &#8217;til now. Hopefully you can pick out a few to start forming an easy strategy for marketing your wares and yourself.</p>
<p>This turned into rather a long list so stick with it&#8230;</p>
<h1>Marketing Stuff that really works &#8211; directly led to sales:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Online portfolio website with music and contact details</li>
<li>DVD Showreel ready to go upon request</li>
<li>Tailored CD submissions</li>
<li>Music licensing on other site which led to commissions</li>
<li>Content marketing (fancy name for blog attached to website): writing blog posts about opinions and thoughts about my experiences. This is all about building a connection with audience, fleshing out a more thorough picture of yourself, what you&#8217;re like as a person to work with rather than just a faceless, personality-less, unknown quantity.</li>
<li>Networking in person and seeing it as an opportunity to make connections for people with other people.</li>
<li>Having an elevator pitch ready to go&#8230; then getting out of the way, asking questions, listening, really engaging in creating the potential for a new business relationship.</li>
<li>Twitter for both forging new relationships and developing ones already made through other methods.</li>
<li>Maintaining and keeping tabs on pre-made business relationships on Facebook.</li>
<li>Word of Mouth recommendations from people you&#8217;ve worked with before. Isn&#8217;t as tricky as you might first think &#8211; be easy to work with, go above and beyond, add value, and make the client feel special (&#8216;cos they are &#8211; they&#8217;re working with you aren&#8217;t they?).</li>
<li>Working in associated roles &#8211; this is really a form of networking. The word-of-mouth that you can gain about you being a really cool person and being great to work with works wonders when you hear about new projects coming up and you offer music composition/sound design!</li>
<li>Collaborating with other artists in relevant areas for free or as equally paid co-creators in order to raise both of our profiles.</li>
<li>Doing really awesome work with awesome people on awesome shows with high profile venues/channels with massive audiences is worth its weight in gold (though this probably counts a word of mouth too).</li>
<li>Giving away free CDs of pre-composed music to trusted filmmakers to license whenever they might like to in the future. Sometimes they&#8217;ll come back to you for a bespoke version or even a new commission.</li>
<li>Participating on relevant trade forums.</li>
<li>Sending showreel CDs out to local and national production companies. I actually did this without checking whether they wanted to hear it first, tut tut. Even though it worked for me, right at the start of my career when I was a little fraidy-cat when it came to cold calling, it was such a small response &#8211; 3 replies from 100+ CDs sent out &#8211; that really, I spent an awful lot of money that could have been saved just by making a few phone calls. Though you never know&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<h1>Marketing stuff that probably worked indirectly, though I don&#8217;t know for sure, or methods I&#8217;ve implemented so recently that&#8217;s it&#8217;s hard to say what effect it&#8217;s yet to have:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Website SEO (search engine optimisation)</li>
<li>Building a website with a CMS or &#8216;Content Management System&#8217; (e.g. wordpress, joomla) that&#8217;s very easily update-able with news, presents a more unified site where the blog isn&#8217;t just an add on, and where you don&#8217;t need to go into the code to make site-wide changes.</li>
<li>Asking for testimonials for your website &#8211; also reminds the client how great it was working with you. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>Following up with email note after networking meetings (&#8216;great to meet you&#8217; type stuff).</li>
<li>Business cards handed out at networking events and included in showreel mailouts.</li>
<li>Trade press and general newspaper interviews.</li>
<li>Relevant website interviews.</li>
<li>Writing articles for relevant websites (such as this one).</li>
<li>Email signature including links to my latest work on- or off-line.</li>
<li>Twitter-driven traffic to my website &#8211; these visitors tend to stay around on the website a little longer than the average.</li>
<li>Scheduling tweets for Twitter to maintain a more consistent, steady online presence and reach more followers in all the different timezones.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong><br />
</strong>Marketing stuff I&#8217;ve tried that hasn&#8217;t worked for me so far (but might for you&#8230; but it&#8217;s dubious, and if you don&#8217;t have time or money or energy, then maybe don&#8217;t bother):</h1>
<ul>
<li>Private online music store selling mp3s and music licenses for media attached to my website.</li>
<li>A website built on flash &#8211; very little search engine traffic at all as most of it can&#8217;t be indexed.</li>
<li>&#8220;Faking it &#8217;til you make it&#8221;/exaggerating your achievements/pretending to be something you&#8217;re not personality-wise &#8211; you get found out eventually! It&#8217;s so tiring to keep up the facade consistently.</li>
<li>Following general marketing gurus and social media &#8216;experts&#8217; on Twitter.</li>
<li>Following lots and lots of people on Twitter &#8211; signal to noise ratio gets less and less favourable, even though your follow stats are high. They aren&#8217;t really a targeted audience.</li>
<li>Premium, i.e. paid-for, online portfolio/cv sites &#8211; e.g. Productionbase</li>
<li>&#8220;Working the Room&#8221; at industry networking events &#8211; no real, viable relationships formed as a result of constantly looking for instant &#8216;usefulness&#8217; indicators in conversations, looking over shoulders at other people who might be more &#8216;useful.&#8221; This behavior doesn&#8217;t really give the best impression.</li>
<li>Music &#8220;giveaways.&#8221; I tried this once and it didn&#8217;t work&#8230; but it might next time.</li>
<li>Myspace page (although I didn&#8217;t put a lot of effort into it)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Stuff I haven&#8217;t tried yet so can&#8217;t say either way. But these tips might send your business into the stratosphere, so am not ruling them out yet:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Professional logo design.</li>
<li>Headshots/professional photography (technically I have but it was for a different business &#8211; a live string group &#8211; and wasn&#8217;t really the right style for what I wanted to promote for my freelance composition).</li>
<li>Professional web design.</li>
<li>Hired professional PR and marketing services.</li>
<li>Email list marketing (round-robins, news updates)</li>
<li>Using bookmarking sites and comments on other blogs to drive traffic to my site (not intentionally anyway)</li>
<li>Paid-for ghostwriters for blog content.</li>
<li>Paid advertisements &#8211; e.g. Telephone directories on and offline, in trade magazines, on relevant trade websites.</li>
<li>Real-world thank you notes (vs email, which I actually do quite a lot).</li>
<li>Professionally printed branded headed note paper, &#8216;with compliments&#8217; slips, holiday cards etc.</li>
<li>Pursuing the press e.g. having a press pack ready, calling the press with a pre-made story or angle.</li>
<li>Video interviews/vlog (e.g. on your blog).</li>
<li>Branded associated merchandise &#8211; hats, cups, tshirts, bags, stuffed animals&#8230;</li>
<li>Reverbnation page (technically I&#8217;ve got a page. but I&#8217;ve not put anything of interest on it. So can&#8217;t really claim to be an authority on this one)</li>
<li>Publicity &#8220;stunts.&#8221;</li>
<li>Cold-calling production companies. (I take the easy route and ask my working friends and colleagues who I&#8217;ve met through networking or working alongside in related media who work at those companies, what&#8217;s going on there. So, technically, it&#8217;s warm-calling).</li>
</ul>
<h1>Final word &#8211; and this is as technical as I&#8217;m going to get&#8230;</h1>
<p>As media composers and sound designers, we are B2B &#8211; business to business &#8211; rather than B2C &#8211; business to consumer. We sell our services or our previously composed music to producers of other media as raw material for them to sculpt into the product that will be sold to the consumer &#8211; the audience. So a lot of the advice for marketing for musicians you may find on the web or offline, unless specifically for media music composers and sound designers, isn&#8217;t actually that relevant.</p>
<p>Ultimately, rather than focussing on the product, we&#8217;re aiming to be service providers &#8211; you&#8217;re selling you: your working personality, your style of collaboration, your creativity-on-tap. You can&#8217;t really afford to just let the music &#8216;speak for itself&#8217;. That&#8217;s your past. What you&#8217;re selling is in your future. Who you are as an artist. Your creative soul.</p>
<p>If that doesn&#8217;t scare you then you&#8217;re probably in the right business. Go get &#8217;em, tiger.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I often get asked for a checklist of things one can do to break in to the business. Here is my personal "top ten" of lessons learned.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I frequently get emails from burgeoning composers and new Los Angeles transplants either looking for a composer assistant position or just advice on breaking into the industry.  I often agree to meet them (usually over lunch) and invariably get asked if it&#8217;s beneficial to assist and/or ghostwrite for a bigger name composer.  The advice I give them is almost always the same.  It comes from my own years of experience working hard to establish myself in the composer world.  A feat that I feel is not only difficult, but one most all of us are ever in the constant pursuit of doing.</p>
<h4>10 Lessons on &#8220;Breaking In&#8221;</h4>
<p>I learn something new on every film and further hone my craft and skill with each project.  There are some truly fundamental things I have learned in the last few years.  Many years ago, fresh out of USC&#8217;s Scoring for Motion Pictures and Television Program, I was given one particular piece of advice, from a highly respected composer that influenced me greatly as I set out on my composing career.  I would like to share this advice as well as some of my own lessons with you.  Here is my &#8220;top ten&#8221; list of lessons learned while breaking into the industry as a composer.</p>
<h5><em>1) You have to break into the business of tomorrow, not the business of today.</em></h5>
<p>Basil Poledouris said that. Today&#8217;s working directors and producers already have established composer relationships they go back to over and over. You have to find the up and coming directors and producers of &#8220;tomorrow&#8221; and work with them now before they make it in Hollywood. When they eventually get their first studio gig, they will usually go back to the people they know and trust from when they were struggling themselves. Hopefully you will be one of those people on their team.</p>
<h5><em>2) Everyone&#8217;s path is different.</em></h5>
<p>So don&#8217;t think if you do what the guy next to you is doing, you will get the same result.  Some composers are at the right place (or on the right film) at the right time, and their preparation synergistically meets with their opportunity.  Some pound the grind stone for years and years before getting noticed.  Careers are like snowflakes.  No two career paths are alike.</p>
<h5><em>3) Set a precedent as Department Head.</em></h5>
<p>Music Composer (as on-screen credited on a film or show) is a &#8220;department head&#8221; job. The only way you will get bigger and better department head jobs (on multi-million dollar films) is to have a proven track record AS A DEPARTMENT HEAD on previous SUCCESSFUL films. Being the composer&#8217;s assistant, ghostwriter, orchestrator or musician on studio films do not count as a DEPARTMENT HEAD and will not help a studio see you as less of a risk in the composer job. I have learned this from 4 different studio level producers. This is all I have been hearing for the last 8-9 years.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, composer assistants, orchestrators, etc&#8230;are positions to be respected and it is valid work.  It just usually does not lead to a career as the lead composer.  And it certainly will not give you the freedom to develop your own &#8220;sound&#8221; which is also very important in building your brand as a composer.   Remember, your sound is what you will get hired for.</p>
<h5><em>4) Main title, on-screen credits matter most.</em></h5>
<p>If you are not the on-screen credited person, the credit really will not count to a producer hiring you to be their lead composer.  This is a subtle difference.  Again&#8230;working under the wing of another composer is valuable experience and work to be proud of, but you were not the lead composer in charge.  Your reputation was not the one on the line.  It is that on-screen, single, main title card credit of &#8220;music by&#8230;&#8221; that really matters most on your resumé.</p>
<h5><em>5) Recommendations are key.</em></h5>
<p>A word of mouth recommendation is a more powerful influence to getting a gig than anything else. If you get a strong recommendation from someone a director or producer respects, they will hire you nine times out of ten. One job truly leads to the next in this business.  And it is not just about getting &#8220;the gig&#8221; but also getting their next gig.  If the people you are working for hire you over and over again, you are probably doing something right.  If not, you may have to do some self evaluation.</p>
<h5><em>6) The entertainment industry is a business of relationships.</em></h5>
<p>Those relationships take years to establish. Trust takes a long time to build and a short time to fall.  You better be in this for the long haul.  Do not expect to arrive in town and think you are going to quickly find work.  It may take a good 5-7 years to start composing on films where people will start to notice you and another 5-7 to build off of that.  Ask yourself, are you in this for the long haul?</p>
<h5><em>7) Be a good listener. Be a good communicator.</em></h5>
<p>I could go on and on about this one in an article by itself. But to be successful in your job, you will have to be a master at both of these tasks.</p>
<h5><em>8) Be &#8220;production friendly.&#8221;</em></h5>
<p>Meaning&#8230; don&#8217;t be myopic to the music department issues only. Learn about every other step of the process in making a film. Heck&#8230;produce your own film sometime to learn about all the other issues one has to deal with in shooting and budgeting for a film. It will not only help you better communicate with a director as the composer, but it WILL make you a better composer in the long run. You will understand where everyone has just come from on a shoot and why things are the way they are in Post (which is usually the only thing composers care about).</p>
<h5><em>9) You must be well rounded in your skills.</em></h5>
<p>A successful composer in Hollywood is not just successful because they are good at composing music. Most all of them are great business people as well. They know how to market themselves. They know how to work a room at a meeting or at a social event. And, they know how to make a director feel like their film is the best film of the year. I know plenty of great composers.  The ones who do not make it usually fail due to issues completely unrelated to being a composer. The ones who have made it to various degrees (while competent in their craft) were not always the best composers&#8230;but were great at all of the other things. They were pleasant to be around and had a work ethic and professionalism that pushed them above the rest.  And thus&#8230;they kept getting hired.</p>
<h5><em>10) Refer back to #1.</em></h5>
<p>Holding true to these lessons over the last few years while working and following my own path has led me to conclude that doing my own music, developing my own sound, and networking to get my own composer gigs was the path for me. Maybe it isn&#8217;t for you. Perhaps you may want to experience the industry from the perspective of being someone&#8217;s assistant for a while; you can obtain real world experience and at least make a living while working in the field of music. Again for me, I would much rather spend all of my time on building my own credit list, reputation and skills as the lead composer.</p>
<h4>Thinkers Welcome.</h4>
<p>What are your &#8220;lessons learned&#8221;? COMMENTS are wide open below, and I&#8217;d love to hear your list!</p>

		<description><![CDATA["Oh no! Please, not another social network,“ you may think. But here are a few reasons why you might want to give Google+ a place in your marketing plan as a film composer.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Oh no! Please, not another social network,&#8221; you may think, but if you already approach it like this you won’t have use for it anyway. If you feel different about it, however, and are open minded enough to simply say, &#8220;Hell, why not? Let’s give it a try and if it sucks, I am outta there,&#8221; then you might want to read on.</p>
<p>Why am I saying that <a href="https://plus.google.com/111918910792221111756" target="_blank">Google+</a> will have huge advantages for composers and musicians in general? (Please keep in mind that I am not trying to compare it to other social networks. We all know what&#8217;s possible with them … and what&#8217;s not!)</p>
<h4><strong>Circles</strong></h4>
<p>At first sight it might look a bit irritating, but once understood, the concept of Circles make big sense. Basically, Circles are nothing more than lists you are able to create for specific people. You can create a Circle for all your clients, or one for all the musicians you might considering hiring for your next project. You may create a Circle for friends and one for family.</p>
<p>The possibilities are almost endless. Just a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have close friends, spread around the globe and you feel like sharing some private news but don’t feel like involving all of your clients? Simply set up a specific Circle by only involving your friends!</li>
<li>You are looking for a guitar player to hire for your next project. Isn’t it a great option to only send a post out to your &#8220;hire musicians&#8221; Circle and leave the stream &#8220;uncluttered&#8221; for your clients or friends?</li>
<li>One of your hobbies might be Lucid Dreaming and you want to share and spread your experience but also learn from other people. Put them all in a Circle.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Hang Outs</span></h4>
<p>This is really a great feature! A Hang Out is nothing less than a group video chat conference. Wouldn’t it be simply cool to hang out with your bandmates who are spread around the country and working out a new idea? Wouldn’t it be of great advantage to have a video conference between an audio director and a co-working composer discussing an upcoming project? Wouldn’t it be awesome to directly talk to your hired remote musician to discus that violin arrangement?</p>
<h4><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Huddles</span></h4>
<p>Woot? Yes, a huddle is basically a &#8220;text chat&#8221; between two or several members on your mobile phone. It works really well and gives you the option to arrange, e.g. a changing meeting, letting several people know that you might be late due to a traffic jam or whatever … you get the idea!</p>
<h4><strong>The Stream and your posts</strong></h4>
<p>There is really lot to the Stream and how you can post content on <a href="https://plus.google.com/111918910792221111756" target="_blank">Google+</a>. One of the strongest features is that you are not limited to 140 characters—you can almost write a full-length blog post. I couldn’t say it better than <a href="http://profiles.google.com/mike.elgan" target="_blank">+Mike Elgan</a> did:</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of saying, &#8216;I’m going to write a blog post now,&#8217; or &#8216;I’m going to send an e-mail,&#8217; or &#8216;I think I’ll tweet something,&#8217; you simply say what you have to say, then decide who you’re going to say it to.</p>
<p>If you address it to “<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Public</em></span>” it’s a blog post.<br />
If you address it to “<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your Circles</span></em>” it’s a tweet.<br />
If you address it to your “<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>My Customers</em></span>” Circle it’s a business newsletter.<br />
If you address it to a single person, it can be a letter to your mother.<br />
I’d say this is pretty revolutionary.</p></blockquote>
<p>I simply have to agree with him!</p>
<p>I hope I was able to give you a bit of an insight of what is possible with <a href="https://plus.google.com/111918910792221111756" target="_blank">Google+</a>. In my opinion, social networking is vital, important, and necessary—especially as a self employed composer. Please consider that <a href="https://plus.google.com/111918910792221111756" target="_blank">Google+</a> is still in beta and I am sure there are lots of awesome features to come.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Advanced technology has merely enabled us to be efficient, but composing music for media is much more than efficiency.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/01/sig-bellis.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1060" title="sig-bellis" alt="Richard Bellis—SCOREcast composing" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/01/sig-bellis.jpg" width="136" height="136" /></a>When stores or online shopping sites offer something at a “sale” price they always show the “regular” price for comparison.  If there is no comparative regular price then the shopper perceives the value or worth of the item to be the price shown.</p>
<p>If the current composing community was comprised solely of a limited number of veteran composers, adjustments in the price of a film score—either due to the economy or because the composer just wanted to do a particular low-budget project—would be made based on a reduction of their regular price. However, with so many of the available composers being of emerging status or those just starting to build their career, and without a regular or established price or the representation to engage in negotiations, the price too often becomes whatever is perceived as a “competitive edge” (currently zero dollars with IMDB credit).  This, then, becomes an industry norm and is perceived to be the value or worth of music for that particular category of media.</p>
<p>Deane Ogden makes a good point in his SCOREcast article <em><a href="../../../2010/12/deane-ogden-community-counts.html" target="_blank">Community Counts</a></em>.  Advanced technology has merely enabled us to be efficient, but composing music for film is much more than efficiency.  It is the composer’s ability to diagnose how much music and of what kind the music should be.  Then to create, not from whatever samples are available but from one’s musical background and intellect, the perfect score for that production—and that particular film maker.  And, in addition, to offer input to that filmmaker even when he/she may not agree.  This last duty, if not coming from a place of experience, must then rely upon an extensive backlog of viewing and analysis of film scores coupled with the tact and charm of presentation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Let’s “re-sophisticate” our profession.</p></blockquote>
<p>Two of the four words above deserve some reflection—<em>Sophisticate</em> and <em>Profession</em>.</p>
<h2>Defining the Role of Composing</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Artist</strong> = An unrestricted creative</li>
<li><strong>Artisan</strong> = Creativity with functionality</li>
<li><strong>Professional</strong> = (used as a noun)  Highly educated, mostly salaried workers, who enjoy considerable work autonomy, a comfortable salary, and are commonly engaged in creative and intellectually challenging work. Less technically, it may also refer to a person having impressive competence in a particular activity.</li>
<li><strong>Profession</strong> = A calling requiring specialized knowledge and often long and intensive academic preparation.</li>
<li><strong>Craftsperson</strong> = A person who practices a craft with great skill.  Creates to specification.</li>
<li><strong>Worker</strong> = A person who is employed to do physical or mental work for wages.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to think of composing for media as neither the first nor the last of the definitions above.  I’m afraid that we might be slipping toward the “worker” category due to a perception stemming from technology and supply-and-demand ratios.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sophistication</strong> (Synonyms)<br />
—refinement<br />
—elegance<br />
—finesse<br />
—poise<br />
—tact</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sophistication</strong> (Definition)<br />
— sophisticated character, ideas, tastes, or ways as the result of education, worldly experience, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, the hardware and software with which we work is sophisticated but it is also readily available to everyone &#8211; including the film maker (think Garage Band and Apple Loops).</p>
<p>The <em>sophistication of our profession</em> comes from our experience as players and listeners; our musical education; our musical taste and our ability to write only what is needed and no more (a.k.a. discrimination).  Hardware, software and the people to operate them are in plentiful supply but the musical and mental skill-sets of a true media composer are what is rarer and of greatest value.</p>
<p>What we, as composers, need to focus on are the skills and talents which cannot be purchased online or in a music equipment store.  As “machine operators” we are worth slightly more than minimum wage, but as professionals we are worth what I consider to be far more appropriate compensation.</p>
<p>What do <em>you</em> think?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/11/sig-ralston1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-956" title="sig-ralston" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/11/sig-ralston1.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>That is the question.</p>
<p>Lately, I have been talking to some industry friends of mine about their career philosophies and techniques for getting work. And while everyone has a different take on how they approach their careers, one fact to getting work seems to remain true among most all of them: Being busy seems to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>The individuals who go from one job to the next and have their year of work ahead planned out seem to further benefit from the very fact that they are busy. I was speaking with a good friend of mine who is a well respected Hollywood producer and he was discussing hiring crew for a film. The director of a film he is working on said he wanted to hire a specific production designer and that they had to make this person an offer early because they are busy. They wanted to &#8220;lock them in&#8221; early so they would not lose them to another project six months from now when they would actually need their services. In turn, my producer friend said he wanted to bring in and introduce a sound designer that the director had not worked with before and he was able to use the &#8220;busy&#8221; argument for her as well, even though she would not be needed until post-production even further down the line.</p>
<p>You see, this sound designer is busy. She seems to go from film to film. Some of her films you have never heard of. Some go to Sundance every year. Some of her work even stretches into the video game world. Regardless of the type of project, the very fact that she is always working puts her in a position to get an early offer for more work.</p>
<p>The executive producer said, &#8220;Well&#8230;she is always busy, so she must be good. Let&#8217;s get her.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have always felt that there is a fine line between being busy and building a credit list that is respectable and ever-increasing in size and scope. I have carefully chosen the projects I have worked on and have gone after specifically because I want each project to not only be one people respect, but to also be bigger in budget and scope than the last one. But there is a fine line: One can&#8217;t let the fear of remaining stagnant in their careers keep them from getting work, either. There has to be some middle ground.</p>
<p>I do not subscribe to the philosophy that you never turn down work. Sometimes the film or project may not be a good fit for you creatively and if your career is going to be hurt by your involvement, perhaps it is not a project worth taking on. Also, you may have certain financial obligations that prohibit you from taking some jobs that may—how should I say this?—<em>require</em> you to become an investor in the film. We have all been there.</p>
<p>Then again, if you are not busy and the phone isn&#8217;t ringing as much as you would like (especially in this economy), perhaps being busy, regardless of the type of project, would be a <em>good</em> thing. It creates momentum. Being busy creates demand for your work. As humans, we subconsciously see what everyone else is getting and we want that, too. Ultimately, you do want to create demand for yourself and your music, and perhaps the simple act of being a busy composer, regardless of what you are busy with&#8230; will do that for you.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In our industry, it's go, go, go, go, go, and go some more. How long can you drive on one tank of gas?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had a conversation recently with a fellow film composer about &#8220;creative burnout&#8221;. This person isn&#8217;t feeling it anymore. He told me that the years of rejection and rewrites have eroded his ambition and he just doesn&#8217;t find it exhilarating the way he once did. I listened as he told me about gigs come and gone and what he loved about them versus the gigs of late and what he loathed about those. He talked about how things have changed in film music; how he felt it is no longer financially possible to record a decent orchestra, convince a director to go with a melody over a drone, or make it through an entire film without competing with needle drops for a money-grabbing soundtrack release. To be honest, his long tale of discontent made me very sad and a little uncomfortable. It was a dreary story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Basically,&#8221; he summarized, &#8220;I&#8217;m tired of eating, sleeping, breathing, and living film music only to have to &#8216;write down&#8217; and pander to the new philosophy of how Hollywood churns out movies.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A fair sentiment. I mean, I think we&#8217;ve all felt that way at one time or another. I tried to encourage him as much as possible, but to be perfectly honest, I wasn&#8217;t much help. His mind was made up. He was done. We ended there and went our separate ways with a promise to get together in a few months for lunch.</p>
<p>But, the last comment he made—the one about <em>eating, sleeping, breathing, and living film music</em>—something about that statement really bothered me. I thought about weeks after, constantly. How could you ever feel that way about something you love so much? What would have to happen in order for you to become so fed up with a passion that you were willing to never do it again? Worse yet: <em>What would have to happen to ME</em> to get to that place?</p>
<p>I had a thought about it a few days ago: Maybe my friend is being shortsighted and placing undue blame on things that don&#8217;t warrant it. Maybe his problem is <em>not</em> with the decline of finances in music budgets or his perceived lack of film music savvy among directors and producers. What if his issues are systemic of the fact that he literally <em>eats</em>, <em>sleeps</em>, <em>breathes</em>, and <em>lives</em> film music&#8230; 24-hours a day? If he is <em>that</em> consumed by the DOING of film music, how could he expect any other result BUT career burnout? Thinking about that for a few minutes led me to a conclusion I&#8217;d like to share with you here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">My thought: Instead of eating, sleeping, breathing, and living film music, why not eat, sleep, breathe, and live&#8230;.<br />
and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>THEN</em></span> write film music?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Saying this will probably get me in trouble with my manager (who rides my ass like Zorro to &#8220;write, write, write!&#8221;), but if all you do is <em>write</em>—to the exclusion of everything else in your life—then your music is going to be void of any real meaning or context. <em>Your life IS your music</em>. In fact, what goes into making YOU is as vital as every other piece of your film music education, and perhaps more important altogether. It is the essence of who you are as a Creative. If you don&#8217;t refuel regularly, you WILL burn out. It is not a question of <em>if</em>, but a question of <em>when</em>. It is inevitable.</p>
<p>In thinking about this concept of eating, sleeping, breathing, and living—all four of them mandatory for human sustenance—let&#8217;s look at each one individually and try to determine exactly how crucial a role they play in our lives as Creatives.</p>
<h2>EAT</h2>
<p>The human body needs to be fed. It just does. You cannot get away from that. Even in a vegetative state, your body needs to be constantly revitalized with nutrients. In turn, those nutrients balance the metabolism and create healthful stability. But it all starts with the action of <em>eating</em>, whether voluntary or forced.</p>
<p>Question: How do you feed your creativity? How do you insure that your creativity is continually being provided with a nutritious, balanced diet? When was the last time you just <em>ingested some music</em>? When did you last <em>devour an opera</em>, <em>consume a well-crafted pop tune</em>, or <em>gorge on a brilliant film score</em>? In order to put out, you have to put in. Much like your body needs to consume fuel in order to continue operating every day, your musical metabolism also needs to be fed and maintained regularly. Many of us are educated musicians, but our formal training most likely fell off shortly after graduation, and what ever methods we&#8217;ve employed in our &#8220;continued education&#8221; have been only those borne out of the jobs we&#8217;ve managed to wrangle. If you are a film composer that is hired again and again for the same types of things (which many are), the importance of a regular refresh is even more important.</p>
<p>I have always been a voracious student of music, and it has served me well. There is an old adage: If you stop learning, you stop leading.&#8221; Thanks to the investment of my parents in my musical upbringing, I developed early on the discipline in my life that I refer to as <em>critical listening</em>. When I&#8217;m not crunching a deadline, I spend a solid hour every morning just critically listening to the music of others. Sometimes it is something new I&#8217;ve discovered, other times it is an old favorite. Whatever the case, I listen&#8230; but even more, I consciously choose to <em>mentally notice</em>. I don&#8217;t do this during any other activity. For example, I never do this while I&#8217;m cleaning the studio, cutting demos, or writing emails. I sit in a specific chair, in a specific place on my property, at a specific time every morning, and I just <em>listen</em>. It is my way of keeping the fuel tank full at all times, so that when I am called upon to spill out my most creative musical effort, there is plenty to go around.</p>
<p>Since we can only compose what we can think to compose, replenishing your creative reserve tank is not an option. <a href="../../../2010/07/deane-ogden-the-creative-tank.html" target="_blank">I wrote about this in a little more depth a while back</a>. Keeping current with musical trends and keeping your creative cabinets well stocked is vital to staving off burnout. If you constantly give and give and give and give, you&#8217;ll run out of steam sooner or later. Try to find a way to put back what you take out&#8230; and try to do this on a daily basis if you can.</p>
<h2>SLEEP</h2>
<p><strong></strong>Current scientific sleep studies reveal that most people get less than six hours of sleep per night. To a composer, that almost sounds like a luxury! Dig a little deeper and you&#8217;ll discover a more interesting component of the same study: People with careers in functional fields require less sleep than people with careers in creative fields. Counting money as a banker for eight hours a day requires a completely different skill-set than twelve hours of painting a picture will. However, painting a picture is a lot less mechanical of a task, and therefore, requires a little bit more fluidity of motion, process organization, emotion, and planning. In other words, Creatives need more sleep than Tradesmen do.</p>
<p>Years ago, I began getting extremely tired during the day while I was writing music. I would get a full night&#8217;s sleep, but then during the day it was as if I hadn&#8217;t slept at all. It started with just chronic yawning, which I didn&#8217;t think anything of—but then it developed into me literally not being able to keep my eyes open at 2pm on a sunny afternoon. Something was definitely wrong. I saw a fatigue specialist who determined that I had developed <em>obstructive sleep apnea</em> (OSA). OSA is condition by which your breathing airflow is actually cut-off while you sleep, resulting in numerous &#8220;wake-ups&#8221; throughout the night. Mine got to be so bad that I eventually went into the hospital for a sleep study where they hooked me up to all kinds of diodes and monitored me sleeping for a full two nights. What they found was unbelievable: The first night, I woke up 284 times in a 7-hour cycle. The second night was worse: I woke up 582 in an 8-hour cycle. Something needed to be done, so I underwent some treatments, and now I sleep like a dead guy every night.</p>
<p>These days, my sleep pattern is probably better than yours is—and you might be 22 years old and in perfect health! Regardless, I still need to get a full night&#8217;s sleep or I start running the risk of being slow during the day and generally off my game. It is a proven fact that not getting enough sleep can lead to bouts of depression, lack of stamina during the work day, self-doubt and drops in self-esteem, and sharp overall decreases in productivity. Lack of sleep will also make you irritable, short-tempered, given to fits of spontaneous anger and outbursts. As you might imagine, these are not the kinds of qualities that the people who are making composer decisions in the major motion picture studios are going to want to contend with.</p>
<p>Over the years of doing this gig, I&#8217;ve heard lots of people say a lot of different things in regards to what the right time to work on music is. Some say that they are better in the morning, while others swear by the quiet hours between 1am and 7am. We&#8217;ve all heard people say &#8220;I can&#8217;t get up in the morning. I&#8217;m just not a morning person.&#8221; Scientifically speaking, however, I&#8217;m not convinced that &#8220;can&#8217;t&#8221; is a reality. If you are the kind of composer who always says, &#8220;I&#8217;m just better at night!&#8221;, then I call bullshit. Listen, if there was an 8.5 earthquake in your city, we all know your ass would be up and at &#8217;em like Private Pyle in &#8220;Full Metal Jacket&#8221;! Getting up in the morning or going to bed at a decent time at night are simply two disciplines that are not unlike any other discipline you have surely made time for in your busy, busy life.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another interesting thing to consider: Most sleep specialists and biochemical scientists agree that no matter what time you go to bed, if you are asleep between the hours of 11pm and 2am, you have rested as much as your body needs for a full 10-hour day following that sleep cycle. There is something about the planet&#8217;s biorhythms during that particular time of night that lends  to solid <em>rest</em>. You could get up at 3am, and within minutes, be working just like you would be had you slept eight hours from 1am on. Sound too crazy to be true? Try it. DVR that Jimmy Fallon episode and go to bed. Try it for a week and see if you don&#8217;t come back to your writing refreshed and re-energized after a week.</p>
<h2>BREATH</h2>
<p><strong></strong>Another curse of being a Creative is that much of what you stress out about is brought on by panic. If you&#8217;ve been at this awhile, you&#8217;ve by now realized that as a person who earns their bread by &#8220;making stuff&#8221;, it is pretty much feast or famine in regards to resources. Everything hinges on where that next gig is coming from, and sometimes that can be an awfully stressful position to be in. To avoid burning out from lack of work (which might be the most common form of burn-out there is), it is critical that you learn to ebb and flow with the ever-changing tides of the film business. Panic will get you nowhere fast. In fact, if you avoid dealing with your lack of coping skills in regards to not keeping busy, eventually you&#8217;ll just up and quit. I cannot tell you how many people I know that have thrown in the towel because they couldn&#8217;t stand the heat of an unknown future.</p>
<p>In the film industry especially, nothing—NOTHING—is ever certain, and even after you&#8217;ve signed on the dotted line the possibility of being edged out by some random act of nepotism is stock-in-trade in Hollywood. When these types of things happen, your initial reaction will usually be to either get very angry or panic and start freaking out after the reality of not feeding your family for the next however-many-months sets in. Or&#8230; BOTH.</p>
<p>The best advice I&#8217;ve ever received about getting bad news or finding out that things aren&#8217;t going to work out as well as you might have counted on&#8230; is to <em>take a breath and relax</em> for a minute. If you can, it is even better to sleep on it. &#8220;Things are always better the next day,&#8221; my dad used to say. And that&#8217;s true. Stepping away from the drama and realizing that you are going to live to die another day is probably the best way to deal with immediate stress. Not to be preachy, but alcohol, drugs, and other substances are not the way to take the edge off of anxiety. They might work in the interim, but that&#8217;s it. It will run out fast, and then&#8230; there you are. Creatives have no room in their lives for false emotional boosters or suppressants. It&#8217;s just not how we are built. Your <em><strong>mind</strong></em> is the single most important emotional regulator available to you. And it&#8217;s free! Use it to your advantage and allow it to sooth and calm you during stressful moments.</p>
<h2>LIVE</h2>
<p><strong></strong>Lastly, doing nothing but outputting just takes a serious toll over time. You have to find a way to generate as much input into your life as you produce output, if not more.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s creative climate of pressure and immediacy (filmmaker Robert Rodriguez refers to it as &#8220;creation at the speed of thought&#8221;), there isn&#8217;t much time for what those of us in the Millennial Generation would term as &#8220;restful minutes&#8221; (thank you, Stephen Covey!). There is no such thing as a &#8220;power nap&#8221; anymore. People don&#8217;t soak in the tub to take the edge off. Walking around the block to get the creative juices flowing fast again is unheard of in most Creative&#8217;s schedules. Why? Because we lack margin in our lives to the point that we simply don&#8217;t have the time it would take to do any of those things. Facebook, Twitter, and texting now occupy the emotional bandwidth formerly used to &#8220;unwind&#8221; and the business climate demands that we be on a greenlight schedule 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Not a good recipe for longevity!</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Rest</em></span></h3>
<p>Speaking of technology, when was the last time you read a book? Not an &#8220;eBook&#8221;&#8230; I mean one with paper and a hardback cover? A recent poll discovered that 9 out of 10 people do 100% of their reading online. That&#8217;s cool for the environment, but not so great for the brain. You might say, &#8220;Well, now that I have my iPad, it has become a much more organic experience.&#8221; To which I would say, &#8220;Maybe a little.&#8221; Even still, there is great divide between reading at a book&#8217;s pace, and reading at an iPad&#8217;s pace. You see, the very idea of an iPad is &#8220;convenience&#8221;. Printed books are not, by today&#8217;s standards, in any way <em>convenient</em>. Shopping is not <em>convenient</em> either, hence the rise in Internet commerce in the last five years.</p>
<p>Understand, I&#8217;m not advocating against the Internet or iPads. I use them every day myself. But I also understand the difference in the quality of life that balancing technology will bring. The contrast between reading a printed book in a hammock versus reading an iPad book on the subway. HUGE difference in takeaway velocity. Or the wonder of getting outside and being around people at the supermarket versus buying groceries online because it&#8217;s convenient and &#8220;cool&#8221; to do so.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Communication</em></span></h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s another example: Communication. Most people in my life would rather text me than talk to me. I hate that. You know why? Because there are little to no consequences when you &#8220;text&#8221; someone. It&#8217;s safe. You don&#8217;t have to see the distasteful look on my face when I don&#8217;t agree with what they are texting me. Texting is low-risk. Texting doesn&#8217;t cost you anything. There is zero social output, so there is zero social input. It&#8217;s boring, detached, and easy to ignore.</p>
<p>Perhaps the bigger problem is that texting is also easy to screw up. It is by far easier to miscommunicate in a text than if you and I are standing next to each other, or even talking to one another over a phone line.</p>
<p>There are essentially three parts to communicating effectively:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Words</em>—What you say is important and carries the overall meaning of what you are trying to convey through your communication.</li>
<li><em>Tone of Voice</em>—The way you say something is as important as what you are saying, isn&#8217;t it? How many times have you received a text message from someone where you weren&#8217;t sure if they were pissed off or joking? Most times, if you could hear the tone of their voice, it would remove all doubt.</li>
<li><em>Body Language</em>—Same idea as &#8220;tone of voice&#8221;. Someone saying, &#8220;Wow, you look nice!&#8221; with a smile on their face is completely different from them saying, &#8220;Wow, you look nice!&#8221; with one eyebrow raised and pursed lips. One communicates a genuine compliment of your tastes. (&#8220;Damn, she/he looks great in that!&#8221;) The other, a mockery of your wardrobe choice. (&#8220;What the hell was she/he thinking wearing THAT?&#8221;)</li>
</ol>
<p>Yet, we communicate like this all of the time, and it leads to a disconnect with people and to a lack of fundamental interactive communication skills. Hearing someone&#8217;s voice or seeing someone&#8217;s face is a joyous luxury that we are dangerously close to losing in our culture of convenience. It is the experience of being with someone and really spending the time that is fading away. Many of us have had the experience of working with filmmakers from a remote location. Or maybe you&#8217;ve recorded an orchestral ensemble in Prague or Moscow and have had to communicate with the conductor over an ISDN line from your studio. If you have, then you know that, while it is wonderful that the technology enables you to do that, a lot gets lost in digital translation. Communicating, which should be effortless and simple, gets complicated and difficult when you are not IN THE ROOM with the people you are working with.</p>
<p>Returning to our context, learning the art of human-to-human communication will do wonders for your nerves.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Interaction</em></span></h3>
<p>Ever wonder why most agents and execs dread sitting in a meeting with a composer? Bingo! Composers sit&#8230; in a room&#8230; with no people&#8230; 10-18 hours a day. After awhile of living within that kind of a vacuum, your sphere of influence is greatly inhibited and your studio becomes a bubble that regulates what you can know, learn, and understand.</p>
<p>I saw this concept in action recently as I sat down to talk with a young man fresh out of college and eager to get started in the world of film composing. He told me that he had just come from three solid months of having his nose in the books, closing out his time at music school, with Facebook serving as his only connection to the outside world, and an occasional one at that. As we talked about the business and his hopes and dreams as a composer, he asked me all kinds of questions about the future of the industry. While making a point, I casually mentioned the current effort on behalf of composers to unionize with the Teamsters. His eyes glazed over. Because he&#8217;d had little to no interaction with actual carbon-based lifeforms for twelve weeks, he had no idea that there was even an effort underway to unionize. He was clueless.</p>
<p>I also had an intern once who couldn&#8217;t offer an opinion to save his life. ANYONE could asked this guy for his opinion and he could not string a two-sentence answer together if his life depended on it. After awhile of trying to get him to not be so anxious around others, it became clear that he was a long way from overcoming his problem: Fear of others. He was, essentially, an isolationist. Even though he was a quick on his feet in the studio and seemed do well around me and the rest of our team, being put on the spot and expected to perform was like garlic to a vampire to this poor kid. Instead of giving up on him by relegating him to title of &#8220;Dry Cleaning Picker-Upper&#8221;, my solution was to take him <em>everywhere</em> with me until being in groups of people became second nature to him. And I did. I took him to meetings, I took him to lunches, I took him to mix stages. I took him anywhere that I felt would put him in a position to give an occasional opinion. Even when there was no opportunity for him to do that, I tried to fabricate an oppotunity that would force him to voice an opinion. My job as his mentor that summer, as I saw it, was less about film music and more about how to interact with other humans. To this day, he would tell you that his time spent at Deane Ogden Music forced him to &#8220;learn how to communicate with others.&#8221; I&#8217;m proud of that, and I think it has given him a better shot at the prize, whatever road he chooses to follow in life.</p>
<p>Interaction with others is a crucial implement in the toolbox of a film composer. Without it you honestly don&#8217;t stand a chance because the cornerstone of our business—what makes it hum—is <em>personal relationships</em>. Without the skills necessary to build personal relationships, a composer will never get through a first meeting, a director will never make it through pre-production with a producing team, and an agent/manager will never get you a gig. Period.</p>
<p>In order to build those relationships, you have to <em>get out there</em>. You have to LIVE. Not in a cocoon, not in a bubble, not in your studio. OUT. In the world. Where the action is happening. Don&#8217;t be fooled by those who try to convince you that you can do everything now in front of a monitor. They are only saying that so that you&#8217;ll spend all your time <em>in front of a monitor</em>&#8230; while they are out there making things happen!</p>
<h2>Burnproof</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve said all of this to get at this point: If you don&#8217;t take the time to have a life, there will be no life in your writing, and therefore, no life in your career. You WILL burn out, no question. Creatives who do nothing but sit at their computers and play with software, broken up by the occasional Facebook status update, cannot be that interesting, and therefore, their output won&#8217;t be either. No studio film music executive will tolerate a 30-minute meeting where the composer sits there and stares at the floor the entire time. By the same token, no director worth his or her salt will accept shallow-sounding music that comes from a composer with little or no life experience.</p>
<p>Bottom line: When it&#8217;s business time, it&#8217;s business time. When it&#8217;s not business time, redeem <em>that</em> time with restoration and recovery for both yourself AND the people in your life that are close to you, be it your family, your friends, whatever. When I come off a project, I&#8217;m creatively drained. I am doing myself, my future employers, and my family a disservice if I don&#8217;t take some time to re-energize.</p>
<p>Consuming new music is important for creative longevity, getting enough sleep is vital to good health, and taking a non-dramatic approach to stress will keep you in this for the long haul. None of these things are a waste of time for a Creative. In fact, any time &#8220;lost&#8221; from doing them is not really time &#8220;lost&#8221; but time invested, and it&#8217;s worth it. You have to be able to <em>really live</em> in order to be able to <em>really write</em>. It is these seemingly little things that add up in the long run and will contribute to your overall health as a Creative professional. And listen&#8230; The way I&#8217;ve outlined incorporating some of these things into your life might not be the most useful to you, but the principles apply down the line, no matter what your situation is. What is important is that you have as much input as you do output. It is all about safeguarding yourself from creative burnout.</p>
<p>What do <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>you</strong></em></span> do to &#8220;re-energize&#8221; your creativity and keep from burning out?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[There are 12 tones, and only so much you can do. Right, James Horner?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>James Horner once said, &#8220;There are only 12 tones. There&#8217;s only so much you can do.&#8221; Interesting theory, but is it true? Some of you will say that Horner is just lazy. Hmm. Others will say, &#8220;He has a point: Perhaps that&#8217;s why much of the film music we hear today seems a bit derivative.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whichever, his comment raises a pertinent question amongst Creatives: Is there a limit to what can be created from an <em>original</em> place?</p>
<p>Indeed, what constitutes &#8220;originality&#8221;? To take it a step further, what makes for a truly <em>original film score</em>? Is it the sound? The composer? The approach? The use of instruments? Or none of the above&#8230; or ALL of the above? Why do you feel the way you do about your take on it?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s hard to talk about what you <strong><em>suck</em></strong> at. It&#8217;s no fun. Nonetheless, it is vital if you want to grow and get better. The tough thing about your own weaknesses is that you are usually the last person to identify them, and it seems like others can sometimes be just a liiiiiiitle too happy to point them out to you—usually when you really don&#8217;t want to hear them!</p>
<p>Learning how to identify and examine your weaknesses as a composer, mixer, orchestrator, editor, player, copyist, manager/agent, executive&#8230; whatever, is an important step in creating the career you&#8217;ve always wanted. However, it doesn&#8217;t end there. If you really want to move yourself to the next level, not only do you have to figure out what your weaknesses are, but then you have to find a way to <em>conquer</em> them. You have to follow through on a solution if you want achieve more for yourself.</p>
<p>With that: <em>What is your biggest weakness?</em> And more importantly, <em>how do you plan to conquer it?</em></p>

Be careful how you answer this one: We are certainly aware of the risk involved in even putting this question out there—we are inviting a deluge of the token <em>&#8220;writing music is who I am&#8221;</em> comments.</p>
<p>If we are honest, though, simply <em>writing</em> is not the primary motivator amongst most who do it everyday. First of all, there are far more easier paths to creative self-realization, and secondly there are far more important things in the overall grand scheme of life itself. After all, if you lost everyone and everything in your life tomorrow, we&#8217;d bet money that the least important &#8220;treasure&#8221; would be all of the shows you&#8217;ve worked on, right?</p>
<p>Some are motivated by the joy of &#8220;making stuff&#8221;, and music just happens to be the conduit by which they are able to do so. Others might be motivated by the fact that they are able to support their family doing such a thing as working in film music, while even others might be driven by the mere fact that they don&#8217;t know how to do anything else! Then again, maybe you just like to&#8230;oh, I don&#8217;t know&#8230; EAT.</p>
<p>There are hundreds, if not millions, of potentially motivating factors involved in choosing a career in film music. And so, we ask YOU: What <em>TRULY</em> motivates you to continue on in this tough business? Yeah, yeah, yeah&#8230; we get it—<em>you were &#8220;made to do this!&#8221;</em> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But what is it that <em>REALLY</em> keeps you coming back time and time again to have another go, frame after frame, note after note, film after film?</p>

</ul>
<p>[/slidingnote]</p>
<p>While we often love to talk about what we do right most of the time, these few posts speak instead to some things that I’ve observed film composers doing <em>wrong</em> lately. Of course, that statement in and of itself is highly subjective, but I think there are some habits that are starting to trend that, while possibly not evident right away, will prove down the line to be detrimental to doing business as a film composer in our continually evolving market. I see this list of choices as “temptations of convenience”, and this series might also be called “The Seduction of the Easy Way Out”. In this economy and composing climate, I see a lot of composers taking these routes and while none of them are necessarily “bad”, I’ll try to make the case as to why I believe most of them should be avoided.</p>
<h3>Caveat #2: Fame</h3>
<p>I was at my manager&#8217;s birthday party a few weeks ago and was asked by someone who read my first installment in this series, &#8220;Why did you say, <em>&#8216;You&#8217;ll never become famous being a film composer?&#8217; </em>That&#8217;s not true. There are several people who have become famous composing for films.” This person went on to cite several people who we might all agree could be considered famous in our field: John WIlliams, Jerry Goldsmith, James Horner, and more recently—Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard.</p>
<p>While I would agree that each of those people—and more—are quite famous within the circles of film music, I would not be too quick to say that they are famous as we would define fame within our society&#8217;s immediate cultural definition of the term. For example, ask a person &#8220;Who is Michael Jackson?&#8221; and nine times out of ten you&#8217;ll hear, &#8220;He was the King of Pop.&#8221; Ask the same ten people &#8220;Who is John Williams?&#8221; and I&#8217;m not sure nine of them—or even <em>five</em> of them—would have any answer at the ready. A few may know, while others may only know if you hum a few bars of the &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; theme or the &#8220;Raiders March&#8221;, but the majority would have no clue. This is not to say that Williams isn&#8217;t every bit as influential on the modern landscape of American music. He most certainly has been. But with all due respect to &#8220;the Maestro&#8221;, the truth is that Michael Jackson and John Williams are worlds apart in the &#8220;fame&#8221; department.</p>
<p>In fact, the more I think about this question posed to me by this gentleman at the party, the more I stand behind my statement. First and foremost, “fame”, as defined by Webster&#8217;s, is “the state or quality of being widely honored and acclaimed.” I think we can all agree that by this definition, we as film composers—should we ever attain any great heights of fame and fortune—would be in the minority on this one. Michael Jackson; Michael Jordan; Michael Douglas… hell, Michael LOHAN (ugh!)—I hate to burst any bubbles, but film composers don&#8217;t even register as a blip on the radar screen of <em>that</em> kind of fame.</p>
<p>Secondly, I believe that if the impetus behind your drive to score films is <em>fame</em>, you are missing the point entirely. Maybe I should have said, &#8220;If you <em>want</em> to be famous, don&#8217;t be a composer.&#8221; Maybe that would have made the difference for my friend? I don&#8217;t know. What I <em>do</em> know is that although John Williams ended up being famous doing what he did, I&#8217;d bet money he never intended to write music for the purpose of “getting famous&#8221;. And <em>that’s</em> where I hope people are not headed as they choose to embark on their odyssey in film music. Like anything you put your hand to in life, you have to do it for the love of it, or you are doing it in vain. Period.</p>
<p><strong>The Difference Between <em>Fame </em>and <em>Greatness</em></strong><br />
I&#8217;ve made it a priority in my career to mentor a certain number of film music students during each cycle of work here at the Musicave. One recent student kept using the word &#8220;famous&#8221; every time we would talk about his career goals in our times together. I once asked him at what level a composer would need to be at in order to be free to pick and choose projects as they saw fit. &#8220;After you are <em>famous</em>,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;then you can do whatever you want. Until you get <em>famous</em>, you have to take anything you can get to build your career.&#8221; His choice to constantly use that word&#8230; &#8220;famous&#8221;&#8230; it grated on me like fingernails on a chalkboard. I finally confronted him about it. Susie and I took him to dinner and I told him, &#8220;Dude, we need to talk about something you have been saying that&#8217;s been nagging at me for a few days. This &#8216;getting famous&#8217; thing of yours&#8230; first of all, you are dreaming. That&#8217;s Number 1. Number 2, it&#8217;s just the wrong motivation for wanting to be in film music. No director gives a damn about your desire to &#8216;be famous&#8217;&#8230; they want to know if you love the story enough to give it your all&#8230; FOR THE FILM. It&#8217;s never about YOU. It&#8217;s always about the project.&#8221;</p>
<p>As we talked, the real problem came out. This poor kid has been told all his life that he&#8217;ll &#8220;never do anything <em>great</em>&#8220;. He&#8217;s been put down, stomped on, made to feel inferior, and basically just had every ounce of esteem kicked out of him by the very people who should have been supporting him the most. It became clear to me that this young man equated &#8220;fame&#8221; with &#8220;greatness&#8221;. In his mind, the best way to show those unbelieving people in his life that he was worth believing in was to become &#8220;famous&#8221; doing what they told him he could never and would never do <em>well</em>. Once I helped him identify the real problem, we were then able to have an important conversation about the vast difference between being <em>great</em> and being <em>famous</em>. For him, the delineation of those two ideas was a paradigm shift that he really needed to have if he was to ever stand a chance at this career. Maybe even at life in general.</p>
<p>The sad truth is that many of our graduating film music students are just like this young man once was. They do not understand the difference between <em>being great</em> and <em>being famous</em>. And how could they? Our culture glorifies <em>fame</em>, but places very little value on <em>greatness</em>. They&#8217;ve confused the two, thus sending young people on a wild goose chase to find this brass ring of &#8220;fame&#8221;. Think about this: How many people in your life were extremely popular (famous) but just really not that great of a person? See what I mean? It is a pathetic trend in our society that needs to seriously level off should we hope to extend any nobility to the next generation of film music innovators, or our children in general. There is an entire legion of aspiring composers entering the fold who simply want to be famous or make lots of money. There really are. If you don&#8217;t believe me, spend some time on the campus at some of our finer music schools. I have, and I&#8217;ve seen it with my own eyes and heard with my own ears. Ambition, to these misguided young minds, is simply a commodity to be bought and sold like stocks or widgets. It is something attainable by having as many Twitter followers as Justin Beiber or by having 30 or 40 comments on your Facebook statuses. These kids have seen too many episodes of &#8220;Entourage&#8221;—they&#8217;ve convinced themselves that the way to the top of the film music heap is by becoming the compositional version of &#8220;Vinnie Chase&#8221;. All they need is their &#8220;Ari&#8221; to help them get there.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fame</em> is not Enough</strong><br />
I wish I could stand in front of every film music student enrolled today and tell them that the desire for fame is not a valid reason for doing ANYTHING. To truly get all you can get out of something—in our case, film music—you must simply be in love with the mere act of doing it. Nothing more. I&#8217;m not even talking &#8220;results&#8221;, yet&#8230; I&#8217;m just talking about the <em>action</em> of it. It&#8217;s the <em>action</em> that must consume you. Writing film music must be critical to your very existence. You should love it so much that you go to sleep thinking about how you really should get up and do more of it, and you should be waking up in the morning already late to get back to doing it. The very process must be your only motivation, your every reason, and your insatiable drive for needing to do it some more. It has to be that one thing that you do, that were you ever not able to do it anymore, you would honestly cease to be complete in some unexplainable way—a vital component to your human contentment would be absent&#8230; and that vast expanse would not be a void that could be filled with dollars, fame, notoriety, or accolades. It would be a &#8220;music-shaped hole&#8221; that only writing music could fill again.</p>
<p>Fame doesn&#8217;t do any of that. Fame is a state of <em>being</em>, not a state of <em>process </em>or<em> an action</em>. Fame is not a <em>choice</em>. Fame is something that happens <em>to</em> you, not something you<em> make</em> happen. <em>Fame</em> relies on luck and chance, while <em>greatness</em> relies on consistency of character. Serenity, contentment, balance, and harmony—these are the motivating mechanisms that propel people toward <em>greatness</em>. In this light then, <em>fame</em>, it seems, is simply not enough.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Things film composers are doing <em>wrong</em> lately, and how to avoid developing the same habits.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m going to stray from the recent focus on &#8220;Working as a Team&#8221; and devote a few posts to some of the things I’ve observed film composers doing <em>wrong</em> lately. Of course, that statement in and of itself is highly subjective, but I think there are some habits that are starting to trend that, while possibly not evident right away, will prove down the line to be detrimental to doing business as a film composer in our continually evolving market.</p>
<p>I’m not talking about poor business acumen: not returning phone calls, showing up late, under-delivering or running over-budget. To be honest, if you are doing any of those things you are already dead in the water! Instead, what I’ll be referring to are things that <a title="July 2010: Marketing and Branding" href="../../../2010/07" target="_blank">July’</a>s theme of “Marketing and Branding” got me thinking about, and I’ll split them up into a series of posts I’m going to call “Caveats of Convenient Film Composing”. I see this list of choices as “temptations of convenience”. This series might also be called “The Seduction of The Easy Way Out”. In this economy and composing climate, I see a lot of composers taking these routes. While none of them are necessarily “bad”, I&#8217;ll try to make the case as to why I believe most of them should be avoided.</p>
<h1>Caveat #1: Catering To The Crowd</h1>
<p>We’ve said this before at SCOREcast (and I’m sure you’ve it heard elsewhere, too): you aren’t going to get rich being a film composer. Moreover, you certainly aren’t going to get “noticed” or get famous being one… save for the film music lovers in the world. And there are enough of them to make you think you might!</p>
<p>In fact, I am hearing more film scores come out that sound like they were written with film music fans in mind from the start. I’m not talking about CD soundtrack albums—those *should* be sequences for a good listen. I’m referring to the actual music in the film. As film music becomes more and more popular (the result of increased academic attention on film scoring combined with the glut of composers trying to fight their way onto the playing field) we are seeing the value of film music being placed more on the “soundtrack release”, and the hopeful (if not fruitless) rewards reaped thereof rather than the accomplishment of a score being perfectly tailored to the action onscreen.</p>
<p>Likewise, social media has introduced new frontiers never before discovered in how film music people are connected around the world. New film music festivals such as the incredible <a href="http://festival.bsospirit.com/" target="_blank">Ubeda International Music Festival</a>, <a title="South by Southwest" href="http://www.sxsw.com/" target="_blank">SXSW</a>, and even the <a href="http://www.soundtrackfilmfestival.com/" target="_blank">Soundtrack Film Music Festival</a> raise awareness of our craft in a way that was never really possible before the level of connection that social media tools like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and MySpace provide. However, that connection of convenience comes with a small price tag: composers writing for the “admission” into those events instead of writing the best score they can for the film. I was asked to be a guest adjudicator at a festival last year where one of the awards given out was a “Hardest Working Composer” award of sorts, and the criteria by which it was awarded was based on how many scores that composer had produced in a single year. I didn’t vote for the person who ultimately won the award, and I won’t mention how utterly wrong many of this person’s scores were for the films in which they “accompanied”. The award was obviously given for sheer “output” rather than any strict adherence to quality, function, or craft standards.</p>
<p>As a result, we might be hearing more and more music that sounds unoriginal and unfinished. John Debney recently invited some lively discussion by posing the question, “Why do so many scores sound absolutely the same these days?” Of the 128 respondents, most blamed the studios/producers for the lack of originality in film scoring today. I believe, however, that the studios want just as much to hear something creatively original as those of us doing the composing long to bring it to them. These days, composers are considering more than simply servicing the film when they write their scores, and it might be showing.</p>
<p>Danny Elfman has been criticized over the years of turning out scores that do not necessarily provide for a great listening experience independent of the film they were scored for. To that I say, &#8220;Perfect!&#8221; Do you think Mr. Elfman gives a hoot about whether or not his music works outside of the picture? I assure you, he doesn’t. And you shouldn&#8217;t either. No accolades, awards, reviews, or journalistic opinions could ever substitute for a well-written score tailor-made for the story by which it intends to serve.  To be a &#8220;good&#8221; composer (I&#8217;m not even talking <em>great</em> here… just <em>good</em>) you must come to the realization that you are there to do one single thing: service the film. That&#8217;s it. If you are aiming for any more than that in your duties then you are not fulfilling your duties at all. In fact, you are wasting your client&#8217;s, the studio&#8217;s, and your team&#8217;s valuable time. You are hunting for something more than what the job entails… you are hunting for a trophy. At that point, not only are you out of the flow of creativity, but you are also self-servingly seeking to gain something without truly putting your heart and soul into the work required to attain it.</p>
<p>My challenge? THROW yourself into your next project with reckless abandon. Don&#8217;t settle. Write music that you never knew was in you. Do not take your job lightly. Do not cut corners or take shortcuts. Do not rely on old, tired, and familiar devices, progressions, melodies, or motifs. In short, don&#8217;t make it easy on yourself. Challenge yourself to write bigger, better, and smarter. Orchestrate from a passionate place, not from an educational one. Voice your music with a new clarity and not with the palette you voiced from the last time or two. Do something different. If your principals are not sold on it, get off your ass and sell them on it! Convince them that this is the way to go if you know in your heart that it is what is best for the film. Instead of writing like it is the<em> first score</em> you&#8217;ll ever be recognized for, write as if it is the <em>last score</em> you&#8217;ll ever write. Everything else will take care of itself.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[This one single piece of advice will change your life, I promise.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t spend a lot of time online. I&#8217;m sure I should, and I bet there is some self-appointed social networking &#8220;expert&#8221; out there that would scold me for my lack of attention to online marketing. I don&#8217;t have a &#8220;dot com&#8221; and I don&#8217;t (think?) I have a &#8220;brand.&#8221; In fact, I barely have a business card. You should see it—it&#8217;s a simple white card in black Arial Bold that says, &#8220;Jai Meghan : Scoring Assistant&#8221;, with my phone number. Problem is, the phone number is not in service anymore, so underneath the crossed out phone number (in Sharpie, of course!) is my new Gmail address that was only set up a few months ago. By the time I finally remember to log in and check my Facebook messages—and honestly, I&#8217;m not even sure <em>that&#8217;s</em> what Facebook is really for—they are so old that the person has written a follow up that goes something like, &#8220;Dude, are you mad at me or something?&#8221;.</p>
<p>Basically, I suck.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m terrible at promotion. What I am great at, however, is returning calls, responding to emails; all of the things that are required to do business. I can handle those tasks with no problems, but when it comes to these social networking tools that are the rage right now, I&#8217;m the last guy you want advice from.</p>
<p>And so&#8230; I&#8217;ll do the opposite. I&#8217;m going to give you the antidote to all of those things; the secret weapon; the Kryptonite to what everyone else is telling you. I&#8217;m going to tell you what works better than any Tweet, Facebook status update, or MySpace Bulletin will ever work. This one single piece of advice will change your life, I promise.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Shut up and score.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This town—Los Angeles—is full of crap&#8230; and I&#8217;m not talking about content, I&#8217;m talking about people&#8217;s lines of BS. Vigorous self-promotion and self-aggrandizement the likes of nothing I&#8217;ve ever seen. Everyone has a spiel. Everybody has a schtick. I see many composers online talking about this and that on Twitter or Facebook—what they&#8217;ve done, what they are doing—and I think, &#8220;But how is your music?&#8221;</p>
<p>There seems to be two types of people in this particular area of focus: The composers that talk about everything that&#8217;s going on but have nothing <em>actually</em> going on, and the composers who talk about the stuff they <em>actually</em> <em>do</em> have going on. The second group I will &#8220;follow&#8221; or &#8220;friend&#8221;, and the first I absolutely will not.</p>
<p>There is another group of people that I will not be associated with who just gather follows or friends. I cannot tell you how many friend requests I get from people that are just out looking to build up their number of friends on Facebook or their followers on Twitter. If you are one of these people—and it is easy to tell who you are because either we have tons of friends in common but have never met or spoken, or worse yet, we have <em>zero</em> friends in common and have never spoken!—I will decline you without hesitation.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing, and then I&#8217;ll give you SCOREcasters the floor to tell me why I&#8217;m wrong or right&#8230; If you are a great composer, PROVE IT. Let us hear this amazing sound that&#8217;s coming out of your head. You don&#8217;t need to self-promote. Your <em>music</em> should do that talking. Your <em>work</em> should be your promoter. If you feel like you need to self-promote (which, given the fierce competition out there, you very well might), then do it with your work. Post some of your cues every once in a while. Have some guts! Let us hear this amazing music you keep talking about. Risk a little and put yourself out there. Let the world experience the creativity you have pouring forth. I seriously doubt your producers/directors will care. If you think they will, then ask them! I think you&#8217;ll be surprised as to what they say.</p>
<p>Quietly promote yourself, and back it up with evidence. To put it bluntly&#8230; Shut up and score.</p>
<p>FACEBOOK EXAMPLES WITH CLEAN, QUIET PROMOTION&#8230; WITH THE GUTS TO BACK IT UP WITH MUSIC:</p>

<p><strong>——————</strong></p>
<p>A pro is someone who gets paid for what they do, pure and simple.</p>
<p>Compare this with the opposite, the definition of an amateur, who does the same thing only for the love of it (i.e. for free).</p>
<p>As soon as you get paid, you can legitimately call yourself a professional. A &#8216;Pro&#8217;.</p>
<p>But, ultimately, only by <em>being professional</em> can you get to this point <em>and stay there</em>.</p>
<p>A roundup of the qualities of the Pro Film Music Composer (by no means exhaustive!) follows…</p>
<p><strong>1.  It&#8217;s business, not a hobby</strong><br />
If you&#8217;re in this business as a pro, then you&#8217;re a businessman/woman. That means working regularly, persistently on not only your music but <em>on</em> your business.</p>
<p>Get your affairs in order: tax, insurance, working environment, legal requirements. You&#8217;re in this game to sell your music, to get paid for composing.</p>
<p><strong>2.  Be an expert</strong><br />
Educate yourself in composition, musical styles, and methods of collaboration and delivery.</p>
<p>Keep your knowledge up-to-date with new technological innovations, musical trends, media language, etc. Have an <em>informed</em> opinion.</p>
<p>Note: this does not mean jumping on the bandwagon/keeping-up-with-the-Jones&#8217; by buying every new piece of technology that comes out. This does mean knowing what&#8217;s new, what it can do, and what it may or may not be able to do for you now and in the future.</p>
<p><strong>3.  Be objective</strong><br />
You&#8217;re creating raw materials for someone else to manipulate, not a completely finished, final product. Don&#8217;t get precious.</p>
<p>Accept criticism graciously.  It&#8217;s not personal; even when it seems like it is. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>4.  Pro-actively research and create opportunities</strong><br />
Use downtime between gigs to update your showreel, website and promotional materials — you never know when you&#8217;ll get asked for them.</p>
<p>Seek out new contacts and build relationships; plan ahead, refine your business systems, identify potential new opportunities in the making, and then <em>go after them</em>.</p>
<p><strong>5.  Invest in your business</strong><br />
Invest <em>time</em> in your education, your experience, and in building relationships with potential clients.</p>
<p>Invest <em>money</em> in equipment — the right tool for the right job — and, again, in your education, both in your skills and in running a business.</p>
<p>Invest <em>energy</em>: this isn&#8217;t a job you can just fall into. It takes focus, motivation, persistence and courage. Get on and do it already.</p>
<p>Invest in your <em>team</em> and build support networks for streams of advice and leads on sources of work, and identify potential assistants and colleagues that can bring complementary skills when you might need them. Build your team in advance to save essential writing time when that call finally does come through.</p>
<p><strong>6.  Take responsibility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be responsible for your business; you know you&#8217;ve no-one to hold accountable but yourself.</li>
<li>Act professionally: deliver on time; be courteous, civilised, and amiable to work with, yet focused; be prepared for any and all contingencies you reasonably can be; learn from past mistakes and plan for future successes.</li>
</ul>
<p>So whilst being paid for a gig defines you in the moment as a &#8216;Pro&#8217;, <em>being</em> a Pro will more importantly get you to that point and give you the best shot at <em>staying</em> Pro!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a whole category of cliché that seems, at first glance, to revel in shallowness. &#8220;Fake it till you make it,&#8221; &#8220;image is everything,&#8221; &#8220;style over substance&#8221; and a bunch of others, all trumpeting the virtue of <em>looking</em> the part… to the detriment, one supposes, of actually <em>being</em> the part.</p>
<p>Our career, though, hinges on perception. In fact, film music could be said to be <em>all about</em> manipulating the perception of an audience (through music). So maybe there&#8217;s an argument to be made that these clichés, empty and soulless as they may seem, actually have some value for us in our day-to-day professional lives. More on image, and why it is actually important, after the jump.</p>
<p>The next time you&#8217;re at a gathering of film music professionals, take a look around. Compare the throng before you to the <a href="http://www.euphonix.com/pro/news/img/client_music/euph_HZimmer_piano.jpg">glossy</a> <a href="http://www.tracksounds.com/specialfeatures/cue/2007/cue_awards_2007_outstanding_composer.htm">publicity</a> <a href="http://www.suite101.com/view_image.cfm/891214">photos</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/media/rm448960512/nm0853380">candid</a> <a href="http://www.bearmccreary.com/blog/?p=2167">event</a> <a href="http://www.michaelgiacchinomusic.com/biography.htm">shots</a> of A-list film music personalities you see on websites, in trade magazines and newspapers. Realize that the images that these famous composers are sending out into the world are usually painstakingly calibrated to coordinate with their image — generally hip, creative, elite and expensive. (For plenty of others I&#8217;ve seen at events lately… not so much.)</p>
<p>At a certain point some A-listers actually budget for professionals to come in (a publicist, typically, or maybe a graphic designer, or a website consultant… the list goes on) and make them appear even <em>more</em> professional. Professionalism professionals.</p>
<p>Pretty <em>meta</em>, right? Or pretty <em>metro</em>, if you prefer. Either way, these folks clearly believe it gets results.</p>
<p>You may not be exercising much discrimination when it comes to your image, but an image of sorts—the <em>default</em> one, which for most of us falls under the heading of &#8220;…needs work&#8221; — is presenting itself nonetheless. It always does. And people come to associate the look with the profession.</p>
<p>Think about that the next time you see some bleary-eyed, socks-and-sandals composer crawling out from under their studio rock to bask briefly in the sun outside Starbucks.</p>
<p>Perception is reality… another cliché, sure, but when we&#8217;re interacting with individuals who have the power to make or break your career based on their hunches, or their intuition, or simply their <em>mood</em>, I think attention to professional presentation is worth a little head space. Too much is at stake to do otherwise.</p>
<p>These days it&#8217;s a hot topic of conversation to hold forth on those few of us who can command more than a pittance to do this job. I think one way the &#8220;million-dollar score&#8221; clique got there was to <em>look</em> like a million dollars.</p>
<p>It goes beyond the person, of course, to the entire setting: like so much of Hollywood, there&#8217;s a danger of obsessing over the right way to stock the koi pond, or whether it&#8217;s better to roll up to your director lunch in a Mercedes or a Maserati… but this whole thing doesn&#8217;t really have to be incredibly spendy or self-aggrandizing. <em>Really</em>, it doesn&#8217;t. And you don&#8217;t have to have the world&#8217;s greatest design sense to create a space and a &#8220;look&#8221; that communicates your own identity to your collaborators.</p>
<p>It just takes a little effort, and a little thought, and a little creativity. All stuff we&#8217;re good at. Be the kind of professional you&#8217;d like to be seen hanging out with. The kind you&#8217;d pay good money to work with. It&#8217;s a respect thing, that&#8217;s all. And respect is never a cliché.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My goal in starting this website and podcast has always been to make our professional film music community “smaller” as we naturally grow “larger”. Over the past year, our website has undergone many alterations and we&#8217;ve experimented with various ways to communicate and interact as a community. Some of these methods have worked and some of them have needed further tweaking, but we&#8217;ve always strived to make SCO the very best experience it can be. To commemorate our anniversary, we will be launching even more new features at SCOREcastOnline.com in the coming weeks that will make the site even more robust as we seek to better serve this community.</p>
<p>One of the things that I believe differentiates SCO from the rest of the pack is that we are all <em>working professionals</em>—none of us are offerring knowledge or putting something out there for public consumption that isn&#8217;t a tried and true method, technique, philosophy, or question in our own daily working film music routine. It annoys me to no end to encounter people who really have no idea what it is like being a working professional in this business, yet they either want to tell you all about how to do it or they have an opinion that they feel is relevant— never mind the fact that they haven&#8217;t written a note or edited or mixed music for the last fifteen years. How can this person *truly* know what it is like NOW in the film music business, other than to simply speculate on something they know very little about? (And for the record, I&#8217;m NOT talking to those of you who are just coming up in the biz—&#8221;Looking for&#8221; work and &#8220;talking about&#8221; work are two different things. To me, one is of merit. The other? Not so much.)</p>
<p>Which leads me to a potential discussion with you: <strong><em>GOING PRO</em></strong>. What does that mean? What is the difference between being a <em>professional</em> film composer, music editor, orchestrator—what have you—and being an <em>amateur</em> hobbyist?</p>
<p>Understand this difference: I&#8217;m NOT asking, &#8220;How does a person <em>make the leap</em> from being an amateur to being a professional?&#8221; Or even, &#8220;How do you <em>break into</em> the working community?&#8221; Instead, I&#8217;m seeking to illustrate and highlight the <em>differences</em> in the two species—because a working film composer and a film composer who isn&#8217;t working are two VERY different animals… and the reasons why, at least to me, are extremely telling and very educational for all of us at every stage of the career.</p>
<p>Like many of my working colleagues who&#8217;ve had any amount of success at this gig, I&#8217;ve lectured in plenty of film music classes at the university level. After years and years of doing so and talking with hundreds—if not thousands—of students, my spirit of discernment operates at a fairly high level: I&#8217;m able to tell which students have the chutzpah and internal drive to eventually find their way into the professional ranks and which ones do not.</p>
<p>I have a lot to say on this topic, and I&#8217;ll spread it out over the rest of May in various articles I&#8217;ll write, but in the meantime, and to get the party started, here are two immediate thoughts that come to mind that I feel are relevant to all of us:</p>
<p><strong>Personal Responsibility</strong><br />
Everyone screws up. On almost every project I&#8217;ve ever worked on, somebody somewhere has messed something up. Sometimes the mistake is small and it goes unnoticed and gets swept under the rug, and sometimes it&#8217;s a Category 5 disaster that cannot be ignored and the entire scoring team, from the studio executives on down, hears about the blunder. Usually, with some quick thinking and a little magic dust, it is fixable. Sometimes it costs the person their job.</p>
<p>No matter what, and in every case, a <em>professional</em> takes the responsibility for everything they do, good or bad, pretty or ugly. There is no pointing fingers, no whining about how someone else is to blame. If you did it, you own it.</p>
<p>As a film music pro, there is no surer way to kill your career than passing the responsibility buck. I used to compose music for NBC&#8217;s &#8220;The Apprentice&#8221;, and &#8220;The Celebrity Apprentice&#8221; is still a huge guilty pleasure in my home for both me and my family (I finally got them hooked!). One thing that has always fascinated me about that show is how well the teams work together and have each other&#8217;s backs. That is… UNTIL they get to the Boardroom, where they, without fail, start throwing each other under the bus in an effort to stay on one more week. While I understand that this is part of the dynamic that makes a show like this work, it still blows my mind how far people are willing to go to cast blame on others for what are so obviously their own poor decisions. Many times, Trump sees right through this kind of crap and yells, &#8220;You&#8217;re Fired!&#8221;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s worse? These are all people who are <em>working professionals</em>! Truthfully, I&#8217;ve lost much respect for many &#8220;celebrities&#8221; that I once held in high regard by watching them sell their teammates out to stay alive one more week. This isn&#8217;t an indictment on Reality TV. It is an indictment on not taking Personal Responsibility For Your Own Actions. You have to own your own shit. If you did it, face it and be a professional about it. Own up to it, fix it quick, and move on with getting your job done.</p>
<p>Everybody makes mistakes, but one of the things that differentiates a <em>professional</em> from an <em>amateur</em> is the ability to own up, apologize appropriately, and make things right.</p>
<p><strong>Acting vs. Reacting</strong><br />
This is another personal core value of mine, and it&#8217;s a doozy.</p>
<p>Are you the kind of person who <em>waits</em>? <em>Waits</em> for someone to call, <em>waits</em> until April 15th to file taxes, <em>waits</em> to have the tough conversation, <em>waits</em> to deal with broken gear, <em>waits</em> to put processes and people in place until &#8220;I absolutely need to&#8221;, <em>waits</em> to demo for a project until it shows up on IMDb, <em>waits</em>, <em>waits</em>, <em>waits</em>, <em>waits</em>, <em>waits</em>?????</p>
<p>If yes, then you&#8217;ve got a problem. Mark my words: You are going to have a hard time in the film music business.</p>
<p>Again, a delineation: I&#8217;m not talking about &#8220;timing&#8221;. <em>Appropriate Timing </em>is an art unto itself that I will discuss later this month as we dive deeper into Professionalism. No, I&#8217;m referring to &#8220;putting things off&#8221;. <em>Procrastinating</em>.</p>
<p>I like to do the opposite. I act NOW. If I hear about a project in it&#8217;s early stages of pre-production and I want it—I jump on it TODAY. Not tomorrow, not Friday… TODAY. If I learn of a potential scheduling conflict that is headed my way, I handle it this very second. I do not&#8230; <em>wait</em>.</p>
<p>I pay estimated quarterly taxes. I don&#8217;t wait for April 15th to do all of that work. I pay business expenses at the beginning of the month instead of at the end. I deal with staffing issues when they happen, not after they unfold. I take my team out for regular <em>play dates </em>instead of waiting until they are dragging ass and need a jolt of emergency R&amp;R.</p>
<p>I diagnose computers or take them to the &#8220;doctor&#8221; at the first sign of trouble rather than waiting for them to go belly-up two days before a deadline.</p>
<p>I initiate conversations with producers and directors and I do not wait for them to seek me out by word of mouth. I make it a point to network, socialize, and mingle. I work to meet and befriend at least one new person in my life every single day.</p>
<p>I return all of my calls and emails once in the morning and once before I go home for the day. I follow up with all of my team members on each project by sending something nice (when appropriate) or telling them in person how much I appreciate them.</p>
<p>All of these things are in an effort to <em>work ahead of schedule</em>. Ultimately, it all becomes important on the day that a big project hits my studio, along with the realization that if these things aren&#8217;t already done, they won&#8217;t get done for the next 4-6 weeks. At that point, it&#8217;s too late—I&#8217;m committed. The work now dictates how I can spend my time, and no matter what, I have to maintain focus to meet my project&#8217;s deadline. This means that many of these aforementioned tasks must fall by the wayside in order to meet that commitment, and so I must operated in my &#8220;downtime&#8221; with a bias toward working ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>Most people I have encountered that are only sort of poking around with the idea of making a career out of composing act exactly counter to the way I just described. They toy around with these things. But <em>professionals</em> don&#8217;t. And if you want to ascend to the next terrace in your career, you can&#8217;t either.</p>
<p>I had an instructor once who used to tell us that the best way to get to the next level in anything in life—sports, music, business, relationships, fitness… whatever—is to &#8220;start living and acting on that level&#8221;. How true this is.</p>
<p>Where are you headed and what do you need to change in order to get there?</p>
<p>I await your comments below.</p>

It could not exist in its current form without your efforts.</p>
<div>For the sake of your growth as a composer, sound designer, or other post-production professionals, you must underline the importance to your own psyche that this is a moment to be emphasized and cherished, that it is something desirable &#8211; and so to be repeated.</div>
<div>How often have you actually gotten to the stage of delivery in all of your projects? As Lee said in <a href="../../../2010/04/delivery-finaling-and-changing-world.html">this post</a>, it&#8217;s never a done deal that the project will complete and you&#8217;ll be able to get to that all-important stage of delivering your musical opus. So when you do get there… celebrate!</div>
<p><span id="more-297"></span></p>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"> </span><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="font-family: inherit;">Reap the Rewards</span></strong> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Reward yourself &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t have to be expensive, it doesn&#8217;t have to mean going on vacation for 3 months, but it must be significant. </span></span></div>
<div>You want to spend a day reading that book you never have time to get around to? Do it, and enjoy it, and banish any feelings of guilt that you should instead be working on something else!</div>
<div>Go out for a meal, go sit in the park, by the beach, catch up with friends over a coffee. For a certain length of time, be it a week, a day, or even just a few hours, get a change of scenery or schedule and just have fun.</div>
<div>Reward your family and friends, the ones that stuck by you when you were working long hours, the ones that made sure you ate properly and kept the roof over your head whilst you were waiting for the installments to come through, those who had their ears bent whilst you whined about how the project may not have been going to plan or you were having a tough time with a colleague.</div>
<div>You know who they are. Let them know that they&#8217;re appreciated and that they had a significant hand in you achieving this success &#8211; and that they get rewarded too!</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Space and Time</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The importance of stepping back and allowing a little space and time to reflect on the processes and experiences you&#8217;ve gone through to reach the success of delivering cannot be overstated.</span></span></div>
<div><a href="../../../2010/04/weekend-provocation-post-mortem-edition.html">Lee&#8217;s post on the &#8216;Post-Mortem&#8217; process</a> illustrates this very effectively: check what went wrong, system-wise and operationally, select material for demo versions and samples, paperwork and admin updates, thanking people who helped get the project to this stage.</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gratitude</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">I think the point Lee mentions at the end is possibly the most significant in the long run: Gratitude. Being thankful to yourself that you worked hard to get to this point in the project &#8211; that delivering a finished, finalized score is no mean feat &#8211; is essential. </span></span></div>
<div>You have the skills and the talent to achieve something great, possibly life-changing but at least enjoyable for those that hear and experience the project, whatever form it takes. Acknowledge this.</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recharge Your Creative Batteries</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Going from one project to the next without a period of time to recharge can be dangerous. Creative burnout is a serious issue for those of us working in the creative industries, not least because the creative value we produce is our source of money! </span></span></div>
<div>Having a temporal buffer between projects is essential not only for the reward and analysis procedures already mentioned, but for recharging your creative batteries. Get some distance from the music and sound themes of the project just delivered, or risk inadvertently re-hashing those themes and ideas for the next gig.</div>
<div>You need time to let those ideas go and to get prepared for the excitement of new themes, textures and colors that will come to you, given that chance.</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Accept Compliments Gracefully</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Finally, in acknowledging your own achievement in delivering an awesome score on schedule in an organized and professional manner… you must also learn to notice and accept the compliments and acknowledgments of others! If someone praises your work, say thank you! Do not put down the achievement with, &#8216;it was nothing,&#8217; or other such self-effacing statements. </span></span></div>
<div>You know as well as I do: it certainly was not nothing.</div>
<div><span style="font-family: inherit;">By acknowledging success and accepting compliments graciously, you will build confidence in your abilities and improve your self-esteem, which will ultimately mean the improvement of you as a composer.</span> <span style="font-family: inherit;">You&#8217;ll be more assured of your skills and potential, will have more faith in your own ideas and opinions about the use of music and sound in film.</span></div>
<div>Rather than staying within the safety and security of &#8216;what works&#8217;, you&#8217;ll be more willing to take the risks required to create something genuinely brilliant and different next time.</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">In conclusion&#8230;</span></div>
<div>Having the time and space to reflect is no luxury. It is an essential part of the process, a tool not only to analyze and correct any problems, but to gratefully accept the success that you&#8217;ve achieved in delivering this score.</div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Ultimately, it will only make you a stronger and better prepared for the next gig!</span></span></div>

<p>Maybe I don’t know much of what I’m talking about. I’ve done a couple very small projects. But as I’ve mentioned in previous posts, I’m bringing my “day job” experience to bear as well. In my day job, if I have a presentation to give to the Board of Directors, I don’t just go in with a scribbled-on legal pad. I use the official corporate PowerPoint template, organize my notes, think through what I’m going to talk about, and dress nicely. Sure, the information I present would be the same whether I’m in flip-flops or Florsheims. But like it or not, delivery is critical to establishing or maintaining credibility as a professional.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m trying to do here is urge any of you <em>start-up composers</em> to not to disregard &#8220;big-budget&#8221; delivery concepts simply because you may not be working on a &#8220;big-budget&#8221; project. Soak up every bit of advice. <em>Now</em> is the time to learn, take some risks, experiment, and make some mistakes. Read every SCO article you can, do some writing (documents, not music) to get your thoughts down about how you may want to handle certain situations. Research tools and techniques to better manage your computer files. Develop a letterhead and business cards. Go check out <a href="http://www.garageband.com/mp3cat/.UZCMYySG562u/01_SCOREcast_No_17__The_NEW_SCOREcast___How_to_Give_G.mp3">SCOREcast’s Podcast #17</a> on how to deliver a killer demo, and apply it to everything you deliver. It’s best to get all the details out of the way and know what you’re doing before you get too busy writing music to figure it all out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/02/sig-fenoughty1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-719" title="sig-fenoughty" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/02/sig-fenoughty1.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>Pitching for composing jobs is a necessary part of the business. By finding a niche and hanging out your wares, you&#8217;ll effectively reduce your competition from other composers, and by being an excellent chap to work with you&#8217;ll be inundated (!) with repeat business.</p>
<div><em>But there will be times when you just gotta knuckle down and compete to get the gig.</em></p>
<div>I, as a person, am not particularly competitive. Inherently, I&#8217;m more interested in the collaboration side of this job &#8211; I think that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re all at this crazy game, no?</div>
<div>I&#8217;ve somehow managed to get away with competing no more than 4 times for a gig (that I can remember… maybe I blanked the rest of the times out…). Read on to find out how they turned out (save for the most recent &#8211; I&#8217;ll let you know when they get back to me) and what lessons there&#8217;s to be learned.</div>
<div><a name="more"></a></div>
<div>I&#8217;m seriously grateful that in most of my work I&#8217;ve been kept busy with commissions from repeat business and word-of-mouth recommendations. I put this down to <em>finding my niche</em>.</div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><span class="hw" style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">niche</span> <object style="margin: 1px;" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="13" height="21" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><embed style="margin: 1px;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="13" height="21"></embed></object> <span class="pron" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #809e83; cursor: pointer;" onclick="pron_key()" onmouseover="return m_over('Click for pronunciation key')" onmouseout="m_out()">(n<img src="http://img.tfd.com/hm/GIF/ibreve.gif" alt="" align="absbottom" />ch, n<img src="http://img.tfd.com/hm/GIF/emacr.gif" alt="" align="absbottom" />sh)</span></span></p>

<div class="ds-list" style="margin-left: 1cm;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><strong>1. </strong>A recess in a wall, as for holding a statue or urn.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><strong>b. A special area of demand for a product or service</strong></span></p>
<div class="sds-list" style="margin-left: 1cm;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><span style="color: #226699;"><em><br />
</em></span></span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"> </span></p>
</div>
<div>Looking back, it wasn&#8217;t a conscious decision, I don&#8217;t think. It just kind of happened while I was focussing on getting any and all composing and sound design work I could possibly find.</div>
<div>I have a composing niche. It&#8217;s orchestral, created with samples and often has a contemporary vibe, somehow. There&#8217;s usually a quirky or dark flavour to it.</div>
<div>Though to be fair, I don&#8217;t think I can call this a niche. It&#8217;s more like 50-90% of the film composers&#8217; style out there&#8230; so that can&#8217;t be it what&#8217;s making me more attractive to clients.</div>
<div>I also have a geographical niche. Even though it&#8217;s the fourth largest city in England, few people have heard of Sheffield, my base in the UK. There&#8217;s a grassroots film and a reasonably successful television industry in the region… but there are so few composers here, I really have cleaned up.</div>
<div>I suppose I might consider that I have a personality niche. I&#8217;m uber-reliable, never miss a deadline (to date!), unusually objective towards my creations&#8230; sometimes it&#8217;s a rare quality in this line of work.</div>
<div>I do rather wonder if being a female composer has helped rather than hindered my career &#8211; maybe there&#8217;s an element of novelty value there?</div>
<div>So, back to pitching. The first time I pitched for a gig, it was an unpaid feature. I was fresh out of postgrad college and needed to get a credit and some showreel fodder urgently. I beat 40 other composers, wuh yeah! … but I think I had an unfair advantage at that level, and it was pretty much a done deal that I&#8217;d win. It was unpaid, and a student film too. I figured after the fact that not many composers with my experience, training and skill would probably go for a gig like that.</div>
<div>Moral of the tale &#8211; shoot low.</div>
<div>My god, that&#8217;s awful advice, that can&#8217;t be right.</div>
<div>Perhaps rather it should be… be better than the competition! But what does &#8216;better&#8217; mean. Let us know your thoughts in the Comments below.</div>
<div>The second time I pitched, I didn&#8217;t get the gig. There were two other composers in the running, and the best man won, to be fair. The pitch was very specific and precise, and I twisted it a little to suit my style, skills and gear. I had a few redrafts too after feedback, which meant I got closer to the desired product, a luxury not usually afforded to pitching composers. I think I was treated better since I&#8217;d worked with the director before and he was in my corner!</div>
<div>When I heard the music on the show though, I realised why I didn&#8217;t get the gig. They wanted Tibetan vocals and ethnic instruments with a very, intimate, human edge, and I&#8217;d given them music better suited to epic panoramas on a nature show. Oops.</div>
<div>At the time, I was pretty gutted &#8211; I&#8217;d assumed that since they&#8217;d come to me first and that the director wanted to work with me again that it was a done deal.</div>
<div>Trust me, it&#8217;s <em>never</em> a done deal &#8217;til the fat lady sings.</div>
<div>Morals of the tale:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>If the client has been very specific, really do follow that brief, to the letter. If they&#8217;ve come to you with the offer to pitch, they obviously know your stuff already. No need to do more of the same. Be as accurate as you can.</li>
<li>Never assume you&#8217;ve got the gig simply because you have an awesome working relationship with the director/producer/editor/music supervisor. He&#8217;s not the only one who has the final say…</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t take it personally. Rejection is par for the course in this line of work. It&#8217;s not personal, it&#8217;s not that you&#8217;re a bad person, it&#8217;s (hopefully) not that your music is dire. It just wasn&#8217;t right, and someone else got closer to that bullseye. Find out what the finished music was like, learn what it was that they meant by their brief, get over it and move on to the next job. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>The third time I pitched, I have to be honest… my heart wasn&#8217;t really in it. It was not a passion project, but rather a friend&#8217;s film, co-produced with a big-name channel, destined for broadcast &#8211; and so had the promise of back-end royalties. My heart became less in it when I got 3 very different briefs over the course of 6 weeks with various revisions going back and forth. By the end, I was still putting in the effort, but the love for the work had gone. Ugh.</div>
<div>Can you guess whether I got the gig? You&#8217;d be right I suspect &#8211; no, I did not win this particular commission.</div>
<div>Did I mind? Surprisingly (or not), no, partly because by this point I had developed that elephant-thick skin that is so important when dealing with criticism and/or rejection. But partly I was also a little relieved. The brief was really tricky to pin down and changed with every new conversation I had… and I took that as a sign of things to come. Also the tracks I wrote were awesome and I&#8217;m now selling them as library tracks. Win-win. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></div>
<div>Moral of the tale:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>When pitching, if the brief is hazy, ill-defined or keeps changing, you better develop some awesome mind-reading skills. Otherwise you have to rely on the gamble of guessing and hoping. This isn&#8217;t to say that you should avoid these gigs if they&#8217;re the only ones available to you at the time. You may get lucky. Just don&#8217;t get too attached to the outcome.</li>
<li>If a brief keeps changing as you pitch, it doesn&#8217;t bode well for the rest of the gig even if you do somehow win the commission.</li>
<li>If it&#8217;s not a passion project, or even a subject matter that interests you vaguely, the other benefits better be good. &#8216;Cos if they&#8217;re not… why are you pitching for it in the first place? There has to be some inspiration for those lines and dots, you know.</li>
<li>The music you wrote should be pretty awesome if you put your all into it. It still belongs to you. Why not flog it through a music library, or offer it to your local filmmaking buddies for non-exclusive licensing, if it&#8217;s appropriate for that sort of project. Sell it on iTunes. Don&#8217;t let it just sit there, put it to work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, as I write this I&#8217;m pitching again. I actually just finished uploading the tracks to the ftp!</p>
</div>
<div>Yikes.</div>
<div>This time the brief is pretty, well, brief. And not really a brief, more a transcription/reduction of an email conversation between the production company and the funding clients, where they decide that they&#8217;d like to compare different styles for the work rather than being very specific. It&#8217;s really very open-ended. But there are some &#8216;style&#8217; tracks that the clients appear to like and also a sample of the video to work to, which gives an idea of where they&#8217;re headed. And the genre of the project is sooooo in an area that I really want to get into, so the love is there.</div>
<div>So this one is a little bit of an experiment. I&#8217;m sticking to the &#8216;vibe&#8217; of the style tracks, but they&#8217;re definitely in my &#8216;niche&#8217; writing style too. I&#8217;m providing lots of variety within those styles, some very contemporary, some more orchestral and cinematic and also there&#8217;ll be tracks that blend the two styles.</div>
<div>If I get the gig, I want to be writing music that I want to write, that I love to write, that will make me jump out of bed in the morning in the knowledge that I&#8217;m scoring a series I&#8217;m excited about.</div>
<div>If I&#8217;m not the right gal for the gig with these tracks, I won&#8217;t be gutted that I didn&#8217;t get the job. I&#8217;ll be happy that I didn&#8217;t get contracted into writing for a project that wasn&#8217;t my cup of tea.</div>
<div>But I really do hope that I am the right gal for the job. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/02/sig-olszewski.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-568" title="sig-olszewski" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/02/sig-olszewski.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>From my observation, it appears to me that many composers are introverts- at least a larger proportion than the rest of the world. Many of us prefer to hole up in our studio, thinking of it as our cave, sanctuary, dojo- pick a metaphor- and write our music in peace. For people like us, “competition” may be an uncomfortable topic, especially for those of us that are just starting out. How can we compete with the Big Guns? How can we even compete with the Not-As-Big Guns? What do we have to offer that they don’t? Well… maybe more than we may think.<br />
<a name="more"></a></p>
<div>There are a number of things that most aspiring film composers are doing to get started in the business, or even to keep what little momentum going that they’ve gathered. Some of these things include having an online presence (a la <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, etc.), putting their music online for others to find (<a href="http://www.reverbnation.com/">ReverbNation</a> for example), writing for student projects or contests free of charge, and participating in <a href="../../..">SCOREcastOnline</a>. Those are all great, and yes they’re important.</div>
<div>But if everyone does the same thing, what makes YOU any different? What do YOU offer as a startup that not everyone else in the business has? That you’ll work for less? No- tons of people will work for less. What else? Another way to think of this is: Thinking of the Big Guns (Williams, Shore, Elfman, Horner, Newman, Goldsmith, etc.), what did THEY have, starting out, that no one else did? What originally set them apart? We may be inclined to say “Well, (Director X) has used (Composer Y) on all of his movies; that’s why (Composer Y) is so successful.” Okay, true. But still, this isn’t the root cause. What MADE (Director X) want to partner up with (Composer Y) for his/her entire career? It’s THIS type of differentiation we should look for.</div>
<div>As aspiring composers, we may think we don’t have anything to compare to composers that are already successful. This would be an incorrect assumption. Before proceeding though, I want to acknowledge that being successful as a film composer takes MUCH more than composing chops. So I want to be clear that I’m not saying long-time composers don’t possess any of the below. My point is that where startups may *not* possess the filmography and/or experience of the Big Guns, we DO possess some of their other skills, perhaps on par with them, from our non-composing lives. Some examples:</div>
<div>PEOPLE MANAGEMNT: If you come from a position at a company where you manage people, the skills you’ve learned and use daily can be very useful working with others on a film. Think of Hans Zimmer’s famous “army” of assistants. He’s a very adept manager, and like good managers, he is able to get far more work done through management than the same number of individuals working independently. And don’t worry; even if you don’t have an army of people to manage, your ability to influence people WITHOUT official authority over them can be even more valuable.</div>
<div>PROJECT MANAGEMENT: Knowing how to manage costs, a schedule, manage stakeholders’ expectations, direct a diverse team, communicate effectively (good news and bad news), and negotiating cost / quality / time are all important skills for film composers. They’re also the bread and butter of most companies today, regardless of industry. Even if you’re not on a composing project currently, you can develop these skills wherever you are in your career.</div>
<div>FIELD-SPECIFIC EXPOSURE: It’s possible that experience or education in your particular field can contribute to your success. For example, working in a law office may make it easier to put yourself more easily in a mindset of what music could fit the “feel” of a courtroom, or a law firm. Working with colleagues in India may give you more insight into how to reflect Indian culture in your music. This one may seem a bit nebulous, but hey, it works for me. Both of these examples are from my own experience.</div>
<div>OTHER ASPECTS: A number of other aspects come to mind that may help set you apart or ahead of your competition. Are you a virtuoso on an instrument? Do you have prior experience in the studio as an independent artist or musician? (Examples: Danny Elfman fronted Oingo Boingo; Howard Shore was Musical Director for Saturday Night Live from 1975 to 1980.)</div>
<div>Sure, we aspiring composers may not be able to go head to head with established composers in every way. But we may have more tools in our toolbox than we give ourselves credit for having. So let’s think about what we already know and do, and determine how we can apply it to our hopeful new career.</div>

Not unless you consider hard work, lots of rejection, or a healthy bent toward self-determination a &#8220;magic bullet&#8221;. Is there an easy way in? The answer, as with most things in life, is &#8220;no&#8221;. Most things that are worth doing don&#8217;t come easy. However, there are many tried and true methods as well as some proven principles that most of us here at SCO can safely say we&#8217;ve built our working careers on. While there would never been enough room to list them all, here are ten things that I&#8217;ve learned about getting a foothold and gaining some traction as a composer for film and television.<br />
<strong> <a name="more"></a></strong></p>
<p><strong> 1. Find a niche</strong> &#8211; style? medium? geography? &#8211; differentiate yourself. Embrace your unique qualities. What can you offer that no-one else can? Why on earth should they pick you for the gig?</p>
<div>Whilst it is a good idea to keep on top of the popular styles that are being asked for (the obvious ones that spring to mind are the Newman, Zimmer, Elfman schools of music) what is it that makes your style unique and special?</div>
<div>Got some crazy mad skills on the thumb piano or theremin? Build up your sound from that to give you an edge.</div>
<div>I&#8217;d have to say that one of my defining niches would be my geographical location. I&#8217;m not based in any of the conventional media centres (LA, NY, London) but despite the obvious inconveniences, it does have the added bonus of meaning competition for local composition work is minimal. And my overheads are way lower so more of my profits can go into the business and my quality of life, meaning my work gets better.</div>
<div>That&#8217;s not to say that had I been based in one of these aforementioned media cities I wouldn&#8217;t have made it into the business, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d be at a very different stage right now. Could have been better, or could have been much worse!<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Get over yourself</strong>. Think about it &#8211; put yourself in the mindset of a director. Who would you want to work with to create the music to your latest masterpiece film? The guy with an ego the size of Alaska, delusions of grandeur, who bangs on and on about themselves and how awesome their music is or how no-one can possibly understand the torment of their genius&#8230; or the chap that will really listen to what you have to say, feels the same passion as you for your project and has a sense of humour to boot?</p>
<div>
<div>Headshots with you in your shades looking deadly serious in moody black and white may not be the kind of image you want to project. Whilst I&#8217;ve no doubt you&#8217;re an awesome composer, there&#8217;ll always be someone better (but with the same reasoning, there are plenty of people who are worse, chin up!). Projecting an image of quietly confident professionalism and approachability will get you much further with media clientele.</div>
<div>Offer to demo for free. Go above and beyond the call of duty. If they just don&#8217;t like it though, this is a prime opportunity to develop a thick skin and remain objective… don&#8217;t take it personally when you don&#8217;t get the gig. Learn your lesson and move on to the next assault. There&#8217;s plenty more fish in the sea.</div>
<div>In fact, this happened to me only this last week &#8211; the executives for a feature I had pencilled in to score later in the year decided they wanted classical Indian music score rather than my line of tunage. The director was very apologetic. But even though it&#8217;s a bit of a bump in the road, I don&#8217;t mind. It&#8217;s happened before and I know it might happen again. The same way I know I&#8217;m still going to have the busiest year workwise on the most exciting projects I&#8217;ve done yet. How am I so sure? Because I&#8217;m going to make it happen (by following these tips <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ).<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Get Networking</strong> &#8211; <em>It&#8217;s not who you know, it&#8217;s what you know</em>. Going to a networking event? Prep your elevator pitch. You will most definitely be asked what you do, so get it summed up short and sweet. This is tricky and it really is worth rehearsing this in advance. You&#8217;ve got thirty seconds tops before the person opposite will get bored and zone out.</p>
<div>
<div>Then shut up and listen <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Be approachable. Friendly. Smile! Ask questions, see if you can make connections, introduce and match-make, rather than constantly banging on about yourself, your music, your latest piece of gear (unless of course they ask! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ). If you make a great contact, follow up after the event with an email or phone call. If you made no obvious contacts, don&#8217;t worry, sometimes these things are a slow burn and the chap you gave your business card to at the bar may know someone who needs your services down the line&#8230;</div>
<div>(Oh, and wear something red or brightly coloured. You&#8217;ll get remembered.)</div>
<div>Need to find networking opportunities? Google your town or city for production meetups/networking events, or if you&#8217;re in the UK your local film council office will probably run them or at least have relevant information for you.</div>
<div>Online networking opportunities are becoming more and more viable by the day. Get into Twitter to see if you like the format (hey, I got this awesome ScoreCast gig through Twitter!), and online forums may lead you to newbie director who may become the next big thing.</div>
<div><em><br />
</em></div>
<div><em>All of which should be leading you to…</em><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Cultivate relationships</span></p>
</div>
<div><em> &#8211; with decision makers</em> &#8211; directors, producers, execs<br />
<em> &#8211; with the troops</em> &#8211; editors, animators, post-production supervisors, assistants, runners<br />
<em> &#8211; with everyone and everyone</em>, you never know who in your family or circle of friends knows someone who knows someone…</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em>Every conversation is an opportunity <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></em><strong> </strong></p>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>5. Broaden your horizons</strong> &#8211; short films, indie projects, computer games, music libraries, wedding videos… Get creative with options, do some detective work on what&#8217;s in production locally or nationally. Google is your best friend to start this search. Get digging. Once you&#8217;ve found your dream job that&#8217;s currently in production&#8230;<strong> </strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>6. Be precise with your marketing</strong> &#8211; tailor your showreel and/or pitch package to the project you&#8217;re going after. The horror film director couldn&#8217;t care less about the romantic comedy short you just scored, no matter how lush the string samples. Get specific.<strong> </strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>7. Have an online portfolio or presence</strong>, either your own site or hosted on any of the many and varied dedicated sites for this, with music and clips, a list of credits &#8211; always drawing attention to the best ones! You haven&#8217;t got any credits? Put up your music samples then work for free on student films to get showreel fodder, and it&#8217;s good experience. Attach a blog to your site, have opinions, share your knowledge. You never know who&#8217;s reading.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">8. Don&#8217;t give up your day job just yet… </span>You gotta pay for the roof over your head, and (more importantly) your studio <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . Plus your music&#8217;ll really stink if you&#8217;re starving cos can&#8217;t afford to eat. You get my drift. You&#8217;ll know when you&#8217;re ready to take the plunge, when the income from composing overtakes the rest of your revenue streams. &#8216;Til that point, stay focussed on your dream but keep your feet planted squarely on the ground. Don&#8217;t be an idiot.<strong> </strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>9. Don&#8217;t give up your dreams, </strong>if they are what you truly desire. Where there&#8217;s a will, there&#8217;s a way, and the one thing that differentiates those that compose for a living from the others that will never make the grade is, simply, persistence.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">The singlemost important tip I could possibly give you is to keep the unwavering faith and vision of the goal that drives your passion &#8211; to make this crazy business of media music a way of life.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Be persistent, but not pushy. There&#8217;s a fine line and you only Eternal Optimism is the greatest weapon in your arsenal (that and the latest string sample set from EWQL, of course).<strong> </strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>10. I know I said there&#8217;d be ten tips</strong>&#8230; but here&#8217;s YOUR opportunity fellow SCOREcasters &#8211; share the love around!  Insert your own gems of advice from your own experience in the COMMENTS below!</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tell me if this scenario sounds familiar to you.</p>
<p>A filmmaker approaches you about a gig, and really wants you for the job. In your excitement, you talk through the particulars and get all of the information that you can&#8230; except for the <em>money</em> part. The conversation continues until, finally, there is nothing left to talk about EXCEPT for the money part, and now you are in that awkward position of doing the <em>asking</em>&#8230; since nobody is freely <em>offering</em>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all heard the old saying in our profession, usually in the context of speaking to someone about a possible project: &#8220;Fast, cheap, or good. Pick two!&#8221;</p>
<p>To be honest, I&#8217;m not sure where this adage came from. The first time I remember hearing it was in high school when someone wanted to hire a friend of mine to paint their house. After they haggled back and forth for what seemed like 45 minutes, my buddy finally said, &#8220;Listen man! You can&#8217;t have everything when you don&#8217;t have any money. Fast, cheap, or good&#8230; you can only have two!&#8221;</p>
<p>When I was starting out on the road to composing for film, I quickly realized the value of that statement. It seemed every time I turned around, my employers wanted all THREE. Their schedule was short, their money was tight, and their expectations were high. As it turns out, &#8220;Fast, Cheap, AND Good&#8221; is an impossible impossible standard to meet. So, picking two is very important. Over the years, the philosophy behind this ideal has served me well. I&#8217;ve used it too many times to count in order to help preserve my margins and stay competitive as a composer. It has taken some time, but I&#8217;ve had to really train myself to not be afraid of the money conversation with a producer, although I try to leave such dealings to my manager as often as I can.</p>
<p>However, there is a time and a place for everything, and what I&#8217;m about to say might be viewed as controversial, but I believe it needs to be discussed:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Not every composer is worth paying.<br />
</em></p></blockquote>
<p>What I mean by this is that a lot of people I know who are just getting started get going with the wrong idea&#8230; That simply because they have chosen composing for film and TV as a career choice, a producer should be paying them a certain rate based on the baseline value of a minute of music. Not true at all.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll illustrate what I mean with a personal story.<br />
I know a fellow who is an incredible musician and wants to be a film composer. He is a gifted pianist and has more degrees on his wall than I would know what to do with. A while back, a gig that I was working on required me bringing in some help to finish up some source material at the last minute. I called this guy to see if he would be interested in jumping onboard. The production, although not gigantic, was sizable enough that I had about $2,500 left over to spend on source music. All I needed was three minutes of techno music to use for scenes set at a rave, and licensing a few tracks wouldn&#8217;t do the job — the music had to written for the scene. My friend, who was really hustling to find some projects to get him started, was the perfect candidate for this and it would, I thought to myself, afford him a few immediate perks — a strong film credit, some quick cash, and a stepping stone into some larger projects. For someone who&#8217;d never done anything, it was the perfect opportunity. Honestly, it would have been a walk in the park for anybody.</p>
<p>As I approached him with the plan and laid out what I needed for the gig, I told him what the budget was. His response? &#8220;I don&#8217;t get out of bed for less than $5,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>After I wiped the shock off my face, I responded. &#8220;With all due respect, pal, you have never scored a single frame. What do you mean you &#8220;don&#8217;t get out of bed for less than $5,000&#8243;? Nobody&#8217;s ever asked you to GET OUT OF BED, PERIOD!&#8221;</p>
<p>I cannot tell you how many times I&#8217;ve seen a composer price themselves out of the game. You see, it&#8217;s not that this guy wasn&#8217;t able to give me music that sounded like $5,000 music. He was. His talent wasn&#8217;t the issue. His worth was the issue. The fact of the matter is that he wasn&#8217;t worth $5,000. His resume wasn&#8217;t a 5k resume. Hell&#8230; it wasn&#8217;t even a 2.5k resume — he&#8217;d never done anything! He had nothing under his belt, no prior portfolio of work by which to show me he had worth as a composer, and therefore no guarantee, based on track record, that he could do the job that someone who was truly worth $5,000 could.</p>
<p>In short, his <em>worth</em> didn&#8217;t line up with his <em>wishes</em>.</p>
<p>It is a hard truth, but you have to be a realist about <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">where you are at</span></em> in your career vs. <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">where you want to be</span></em> with it. They aren&#8217;t the same, and your perceived value as a marketable composer in the community will reflect the former, not the latter. Getting the gig is all about timing, reputation, and perceived value. It really has little to do with talent. You might not even be a great composer, but for whatever reason you have done some projects and have proven that you can get the job done. Therefore, your perceived value is higher than the guy who hasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>You have to work your way up. I face it constantly at the level that I am at. I&#8217;m light years from where I was when I first started in the gig, but I&#8217;m also light years from where I want to be. While I&#8217;ll never be comfortable or content with where I am in my career, I am aware of what level I am perceived at by most producers and am working to get myself to the next terrace. Based on that rational, I don&#8217;t expect to be handed <em>Star Wars: Episode 7</em> tomorrow, but I&#8217;ll treat my current gig as equal to that opportunity and knock the ever-loving hell out of it!</p>
<p>So&#8230; Fast, Cheap, or Good? They say to pick &#8220;two&#8221;. But I say&#8230; pick <strong><em>GOOD</em></strong>. You really might be as great as you think you are, yet you are underpaid. It&#8217;s a common tale. But your perceived value as a composer is what is keeping you from the next level, NOT the economy of film music. No excuses.</p>
<p>Too many composers use the economy of film music as a reason to write poorly. In fact, I personally believe that some of the confusion surrounding this proposed composers&#8217; union in LA is born of that same attitude. Far too many composers don&#8217;t understand where they stand in the food chain (or don&#8217;t want to understand), and they think that having a union is going to help them magically transcend their perceived value. It won&#8217;t. Please hear me&#8230; I&#8217;m NOT saying that the union is a bad idea. Not at all, in fact. What I&#8217;m saying is that the <em>idea</em> that a union will help you get more gigs as a mediocre composer is just plain silly. You&#8217;ll simply be a composer who&#8217;s not very good in a union with composers that are. At that point, it just sucks to be <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the bottom line? Make everything you do the best you&#8217;ve done. That is the way to the top. There are no shortcuts, there are no magic spells, there are no perfect answers. The only thing you have on your side is your word, your talent, and your perceived value in the marketplace. You have absolute power over all three of those things, but the third one will take the most work. Yes, your perceived value can be bolstered by you holding hard and fast to the baseline value of your music, but don&#8217;t overestimate or naively inflate that number.</p>
<p>If your perceived value is &#8220;$0&#8221; (you&#8217;ve never worked a paying gig), then you should be taking a look at every gig and working every angle. That is the minimum requirement, anymore, to getting started it in this gig. You do not have the time or luxury for delusions of grandeur. You can&#8217;t be choosy. You need to work and you need to work <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>Know where you are. Accept it, come to terms with it, do your best, and push hard for the next terrace. You never know.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way&#8230; Whatever happened with my little $2,500 source music debacle? I used a friend of a friend for the gig who was excited to just be working on something that was going to be seen. We worked great together. So great in fact&#8230; that he now composes with me on a show for primetime television.</p>
<p>He just bought a house in Hancock Park.</p>
<p>You never know.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/01/sig-sanders2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-580" title="sig-sanders" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/01/sig-sanders2.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>Before we get too far into this month&#8217;s topic of &#8220;Getting the Gig,&#8221; I just want to ask you, as this weekend&#8217;s Provocation, a simple question:<br />
<strong>Are you <em>ready</em> to get the gig?</strong><br />
<strong></strong><br />
<a name="more"></a><strong></strong><br />
When I talk to film scoring students, everything we discuss is framed around <em>facilitating their ability to say yes</em>… because just about the toughest thing you can have happen in your career is to land a gig before you&#8217;re ready for it. Facilitating your ability to say yes means that you&#8217;re identifying areas in which you need to improve so that you&#8217;re ready for anything.</p>
<p>Creatively, technologically, mentally, physically, emotionally and in all kinds of other ways, you have to be in a position to be better than the work deserves. Not that the project is necessarily bad—but, as Richard Bellis is fond of saying, &#8220;in order to move up, you have to be better than the material you&#8217;re scoring.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wrestling with your samples… if your team is still learning to work together… if you&#8217;re stressed out and sleep deprived… you might not be in a position to do your best work. In fact, you might not be in a position to say yes at all. What promises to be a big career boost can become a long-term career anchor—even something that knocks you back to Square One—if you can&#8217;t deliver.</p>
<p>If you follow SCOREcast faithfully this month, you&#8217;re going to pick up ideas and techniques that will, if applied regularly and with liberal amounts of hustle, bring in some gigs. Our kung fu is strong. By February you&#8217;ll have a few new moves to try out, and we&#8217;re going to get you psyched again about getting out into the world and kicking down the doors.</p>
<p>So, just between you and yourself, ask yourself: are you ready to get the gig?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sig-sanders1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-633" title="sig-sanders" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sig-sanders1.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>Many years ago, in another lifetime, I taught creative writing to gifted teenagers for a couple of summers. In each class there were bright, diligent students who just couldn&#8217;t find the right turn of phrase. You could feel the mental flailing-about in every paragraph… they were struggling in vain to get to the point.</p>
<div>My technique for attacking the problem was simple: First, I&#8217;d listen to the students talk about the parts that were troubling them. Then, once they were in the mode of talking with me, rather than wrestling with the problem, I&#8217;d ask what it was they <em>wanted </em>to say. Just offhand, like we were having a normal conversation and I was asking what they were planning to have for lunch.</p>
<div>It was shocking (the first few times I tried this, anyway) how this question broke through the students&#8217; guard and solved the problem. Most times they&#8217;d give me a concise, clearly-worded statement in reply. &#8220;Well, what I&#8217;m trying to say is… <em>x</em>.&#8221;</div>
<div>So when I replied, &#8220;why don&#8217;t you just write <em>that</em>?&#8221; it was like I&#8217;d pulled off a magic trick. A moment before, they didn&#8217;t have the formulation… or rather, they had it, but they didn&#8217;t know they had it. And now they knew.</div>
<div>With all that in mind, I&#8217;d like to try exactly the same thing with you, right now. It&#8217;s not a trick; it doesn&#8217;t rely on any sort of misdirection or showmanship. You can know exactly what I&#8217;m headed for here and it&#8217;ll still work.</div>
<div>Your Weekend Provocation, then—in two simple sentences and without further preamble:</div>
<div><strong>What is it that you should be doing to improve your composing and your career?</strong></div>
<div><strong>Why don&#8217;t you just do that?</strong></div>
<div>Can&#8217;t wait to read the comments and see how this worked for you.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last time, in this space, I walked you through some of the scenarios I&#8217;ve seen as a composer&#8217;s assistant, and how I&#8217;ve either learned from them or eschewed them as personal practices in my own career. Let&#8217;s look at a few more, these ones having to do more with money and time.</p>
<h1>Budgeting</h1>
<p><strong></strong>It seems the higher up the food chain you go in the film music world, budgeting for recording sessions gets more involved and a lot harder. In fact, I would say that the more legit your recording session is, the tougher it is to pay for. An example would be a union scale production. If you are working on an independent film where YOU are the orchestrator, the copyist, the contractor, and ultimately the player, then it becomes quite clear how the music budget should be planned because YOU are the only one getting paid. However, on a studio budgeted film where there are hundreds of thousands — if not millions — of dollars to be played with, there is obviously a lot more to consider.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" href="http://www.istockphoto.com/file_thumbview_approve/4146593/2/istockphoto_4146593-stack-of-cash.jpg"><img src="http://www.istockphoto.com/file_thumbview_approve/4146593/2/istockphoto_4146593-stack-of-cash.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="158" border="0" /></a></div>
<p>Hiring union musicians can cost you anywhere from $261 to $315 per player, per hour&#8230; depending on if you are overdubbing or not, but you also have to figure in your concertmaster and your contractor (they make double scale), cartage fees, studio assistants, room costs, engineers, ProTools operators, specialty musicians (The George Doering&#8217;s of the world), and whatever else your score needs to get recorded. Room costs are very important to consider, because if you are recording a 60-piece group you are going to need a stage versus a &#8220;record room&#8221; (a studio typically set up to record smaller orchestras for rock and pop performances) that will better accommodate an orchestra — the latter of which will cost you considerably less.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I was assisting a composer who had been handed his first major studio assignment. I was only doing production work on source material for the film, but I was close enough to see some of the ins and outs that this guy had to go through as a fairly new player in the game. It was interesting, to say the least, but the biggest thing I learned while on that job was that, for whatever reason, this composer had no idea of how to budget for musicians. You would know the name of the movie if I told you what it was, so we aren&#8217;t talking about a little independent flick here. No, this was a full-fleged studio film in the 170 million overall budget range (and that&#8217;s just what was reported publicly).</p>
<p>About three weeks before the delivery deadline, after all of the orchestral sessions and pre-records were in the can, the composer realized that he had not budgeted enough money for an adequate final mix of the score. He was about $30,000 short. Everyone on our team of six went to work calling in favors and figuring out how we could divide up the mix in hopes of getting it done, handed in on time and under budget. After we all spent the last week of production with zero sleep and a constant ringing in our ears because of no breaks, the score was finally delivered. Needless to say, it was a rough final week.</p>
<p>I remember being so excited to go see the film in the theater. That score was hard work and we all were looking forward to premiere night. As the opening scene whizzed by, another assistant on the team leaned over to me, jaw on the ground, and whispered, &#8220;Thank God for the effects or we&#8217;d be thrown out of this theater.&#8221; The mix was atrocious. Absolutely unlistenable. And now, when I am at someone&#8217;s home and their children are watching the film on BluRay or DVD, I can hear each painful note coming through loud and&#8230; distorted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Schedules</h1>
<p><strong></strong>Isn&#8217;t it always the schedule that kills ya? In my experience, the best composers spend as much time writing music as they can, and as little time screwing with computers as they can. It really is *that* simple! The schedule is the schedule is the schedule. It is what it is. There&#8217;s often no changing it, no making it better. With that in mind, write! Spend every minute you have writing. Forget tweaking sounds or getting the computer to respond quicker, or cleaning your studio. (By the way — if you are one of those people who say &#8220;I cannot function in a cluttered studio&#8221;, then you have clearly never worked on a studio feature! I haven&#8217;t been in a studio production hub yet that didn&#8217;t look like a Level 5 hurricane swept through it!)</p>
<p>And before we go any further, let me clarify something:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Writing&#8221; does <em>NOT</em> mean:</p>
<p><strong>· Sequencing mock-ups.</strong> This can be hired out and it is well worth the expense when you consider how long it takes to accomplish. Ask yourself how many man-hours you spent on your last project sequencing the MIDI versus how much you actually spent fleshing out a lush score for the film? (Go ahead&#8230; I&#8217;ll give you a minute or two to cry like an old granny.)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>· Upgrading studio gear.</strong> This, too, can be hired out at best&#8230; OR&#8230; at worst, done during &#8220;dark&#8221; time when you are so exhausted from writing that you just can&#8217;t write another note today.</p>
<p><strong>· Face time.</strong> And by this, I mean with your principals. While this is not something you should hire out, it is important to educate your directors and producers early to the fact that the more time they want to sit and bullshit about how great John Williams is, the more time they are going to need to allot you to make their score great as well. Sometimes, creative people think they are the only ones that need space and solitude to create. It&#8217;s weird, but it&#8217;s true.</p></blockquote>
<p>On sequencing, most composers I&#8217;ve worked for have people in their studios that do all of that for them. Chill out! They oversee it ALL, so nobody is ghosting or taking liberties with lead lines and harmonies. But what *is* happening is the composer is able to multiply himself/herself in such a way that all of this work gets done and the project stays on schedule. I know composers whose studios run 24/7. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004581/">Harry Gregson-Williams</a>, for one, has a crew come in when the &#8220;day crew&#8221; leaves so that production can run throughout the night &#8211; like a musical 7 Eleven!</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://www.viev.com/images/vievstock/scheduling_solutions_small_355048.jpg"><img src="http://www.viev.com/images/vievstock/scheduling_solutions_small_355048.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" border="0" /></a></div>
<p>Look, you can talk about it however you want to talk about it and you can have whatever view on it you want to have, but I&#8217;ll tell you straight up how it is: Big-budget studio films do not get done with one guy anymore. It just doesn&#8217;t happen. This business is a business of <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">teams</span></em> &#8211; and it has nothing to do with the talent of the composer, whether he is lacking or she is amazing. It has to do with the schedules imposed by the studios to get these things finished on time and without overrun.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s only going to get worse. The music team&#8217;s technology used to be the leader in the movie-making industry. We used to have the coolest toys. That&#8217;s not necessarily true anymore. Special effects digitization, motion-capture technology, and CGI animation has eclipsed the coolness factor of any music-related software that is out there, and in turn, has created ever shorter schedules and timeframes for getting things done in post-production. Like it or not, we *have* to keep up with that &#8211; and so we find whatever way we can to cope. One of my mentors last year at school said, &#8220;More dotties equals more bodies!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Creative Finance</h1>
<p><strong></strong>One last thing on money: Use it as a tool. Too many composers who are just starting out think of money as a &#8220;consumable resource&#8221; instead of a &#8220;tool&#8221;. Just because you are being paid from one job this month doesn&#8217;t mean that you need to use it to go on vacation next month. Instead, use it to pay for a little bit better group of musicians on next month&#8217;s gig. Further your career with whatever money you make.</p>
<p>When I was working this last year for SCO founder Deane Ogden, we worked on a picture that had a very small music expense budget — well under what was necessary to complete a solid dramatic score with a live ensemble. After negotiating the creative fee, Deane trusted his instincts for the legs of the project and took the gig. As it turns out he was right &#8211; the film is in negotiations to be picked up by one of the big four and could be on its way to theaters&#8230; but not without a score that involved star international soloists, a live 30-piece orchestra, live group percussion of monumental proportions, and a professional mix and master by a top Hollywood engineer. AND we all got paid and ate great throughout the entire process! (Mmm&#8230; I love me some yummins!)</p>
<p>We cut no corners on this score. Everything was top-notch. But what we *did* do was use left-over budget from a prior package deal where Deane had taken a smaller cut home in order to save dough for a bigger, badder orchestra on that next project.</p>
<p>We made that few extra G&#8217;s work in our favor in ways that you wouldn&#8217;t believe. Our soloists were all international, so they recorded their parts in their respective studios live in realtime, and were able to communicate through each session over iChat AV. We also rented certain instruments we didn&#8217;t have access to, as opposed to sampling them, so that we could record nuances and articulations that are not always present in sampled form, thus giving the sampled performances that much more of a realistic edge.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the recording process, we ran up against a situation where we needed to hire a player who was not in the union. I called the union and was able to work out a deal to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taft%E2%80%93Hartley_Act#Entertainment_industry">&#8220;Taft Hartley&#8221;</a> the player onto the project. Not only did we get the player we wanted, but also now that person is enjoying a great relationship with the Local 47 as a full-fledged member.</p>
<p>There are many more secrets and techniques that made this particular score special, but at every turn we forced ourselves to think outside the box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Is This Doable?</h1>
<p><strong></strong>You CAN do this stuff. You just have to think. Most of what I&#8217;m talking about here has to do with putting away your fear and really hanging your musical ass out there on the line. It *really* does. Is it scary to think about possibly sacrificing your take for the sake of a better sounding score? Yes! Is it tough to schedule time away from the sequencer in order to really conceptualize a killer idea for the overall musical arc? Yes!</p>
<p>But see&#8230; it is these things, when you really dig out the info, that separates the pettily little Jai Meghans from the gargantuanly ginormous James Newton-Howards. And it&#8217;s the risk and foresight of the James Newton-Howards that make these kinds of decisions a no-brainer for us emerging futurists.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="font-family: georgia;">
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sig-cooke.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-752" title="sig-cooke" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sig-cooke.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>Its late on Tuesday night, and you&#8217;ve forgot to buy the groceries that day. The kitchen cupboards are bare, so there&#8217;s nothing to be cooked. Your stomach growls at you in hunger, screaming &#8220;feed me&#8221; and you reluctantly decide that Turkish Kebab place down the road is your only option at this point. You return a few minutes later with that dirty kebab, and get back to work, having just spent more on the kebab than you would have done for about 2 days worth of food. Eventually after staring at the computer screen for another 2 hours, you feel sleepy and decide to call it a night &#8211; all due to that darn kebab. (What the hell &#8211; this is supposed to be about composing, not kebabs! OK, its a weird analogy &#8211; read on!)</p>
<p>Budgeting and scheduling &#8211; our lives revolve around it &#8211; not just in composing, but in our every day activities. Everytime we budget and schedule something, it has a knock-on effect further down the road and can unknowingly influence the outcome of the many facets of our lives.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be completely honest &#8211; I&#8217;m not great at budgeting OR scheduling, but in the past few months I&#8217;ve become a little better at both.  However, this month&#8217;s SCOREcast theme is about Budgeting and Scheduling in relation to film &#8211; not for life in general, so I would like to to share a few ideas/techniques with you, that will (hopefully) help you to schedule your studio time better.<strong><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><em><strong>Increasing Productivity in the Studio </strong></em><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: georgia;"><strong>&#8211; Draw some boundaries. </strong>Keep your place of work seperate to your chillout/play area.  Having a defining line between your work area, and your chillout area, allows your brain to focus a lot easier with less distractions.  This has been mentioned a number of times on SCOREcast, and I&#8217;m sure all professional composers will tell you the same.</span></p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Use templates in your DAW.</strong> Sick of having to load up instruments seperately every time you want to create a new cue/track.  Why not create an empty template with your orchestra already set out for you &#8211; or go a step further, and have a number of different orchestral templates &#8211; ranging in size and dynamics.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Take naps.</strong> Benjamin Franklin, John F. Kennedy, Thatcher, Clinton, Einstein, Da Vinci, Brahms, and Beethoven all have it in common. They all took <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Power-Nap">power naps</a> during the day. Even Winston Churchill had it down to a tee &#8211; &#8220;You must sleep some time between lunch and dinner and no halfway measures. Take off your clothes and get into bed. That&#8217;s what I always do. Don&#8217;t think you will be doing less work because you sleep during the day. That&#8217;s a foolish notion held by people who have no imagination. You will accomplish more. You get two days in one &#8211; well, at least one and a half, I&#8217;m sure&#8221;.<span style="font-family: georgia;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><strong>&#8211; Plan your milestones. </strong>Create your goals for the day, then break them into smaller goals, and smaller goals again.  In my experience, creating goals means absolutely nothing for me, as I usually say to myself &#8220;yes I know I need to finish this piece of music before the end of the day&#8221;.  However, when you break it down into easy to digest pieces, it becomes a lot easier to see the end and know how to get there.  Even if you for some reason don&#8217;t complete your goal for the day, you know exactly how many smaller goals you will have to complete in the morning to get there.</span><span style="font-family: georgia;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><strong>&#8211; Find your power band. </strong>Figure out what time of the day you are productive at, and try work with it. Most people are either morning people, or evening people.  I don&#8217;t know as many people that are as productive in the day time, as they are at morning/night.</span></p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Go silent.</strong> If you&#8217;re writing an email to a director/client, putting on your headphones blocks out outside noises, and can help you concentrate a lot more.  Having no sound, or even just the sound of music, helps your brain stay on track and stay focused (I even know someone who listens to just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_noise">pink noise</a> as he works &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t advise that though&#8230;)</p>
<div style="font-family: georgia;"><strong>&#8211; Culinary creativity.</strong> You have 5 ingredients in the kitchen, and don&#8217;t have time to go all the way down to the shops to buy anything else as you&#8217;re in a rush (and you don&#8217;t want that darn kebab again!). Try out the &#8220;Recipe Sifter Tool&#8221; on <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/sifter.php">RecipeZaar </a>&#8211; you can select the ingredients you have and it will give you a number of recipes that you can create with just those ingredients &#8211; jackpot!</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Update everything at once.</strong> If you use social networking as a marketing tool, try <a href="http://ping.fm/">Ping.fm</a> &#8211; it can update up to 40 social networks with one swift stroke &#8211; saving you the time of having to go into every single social platform that you use, and update them all one by one.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Condensed communication.</strong> Able to type at the speed of light, and think you could talk to 4/5 people at the same time? Log into all of your chat programs at once with <a href="http://pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a>.  Its a lot more productive than having 5 different clients open at the same time &#8211; one for AIM, Gmail, MSN etc.<a href="http://www.pidgin.im/"> </a></p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Centralize your email.</strong> Manage all of your email accounts using Gmail.  Gmail can manage all of your email accounts from your other websites &#8211; this saves you the time of having to log in to send/receive emails from other websites.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Use shortcuts.</strong> Shorten the time used between turning your PC on, and starting up your programs &#8211; try using one of a number of programs like <a href="http://www.launchy.net/#screenshots">Launchy</a>, <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotKey </a>or I quite like <a href="http://rocketdock.com/">Rocketdock</a>.  Launchy and Autohotkey both allow you to choose keystrokes or mouse movements to open programs in a flash. It might sound stupid, but when you&#8217;re in a rush, every minute counts.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: small;">I would like to leave you with a question, and look forward to discussing it in the COMMENTS:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: small;"> &#8220;How much of an effect do you think that the availability of cheaper music licenses online, as well as the huge rise in amateur composers in the last number of years, has had </span><span style="font-family: georgia;">on the film industry in terms of budgeting and scheduling?&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sig-olszewski.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-636" title="sig-olszewski" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sig-olszewski.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>For most things, I&#8217;m a firm believer in <em>You Get What You Pay For</em>. When my family travels, we always try to book the best hotel room, the best flights, the best everything we can, even if it hurts a little. Because if I&#8217;m going to go on vacation, I want to do it right; I don&#8217;t want to spend my hard-earned time off &#8220;just getting by&#8221;. That&#8217;s just our preference.</p>
<p>For many things, I&#8217;m fine with what works, even if it&#8217;s not the best. In a few areas, I&#8217;m plain cheap. Take wine for example. I really like wine, but I consider it one of those luxuries I&#8217;m not usually willing to overpay for. The good thing about wine, it&#8217;s not impossible to find a great <em>and reasonably priced </em>one. I&#8217;ve taken some time to learn about it- to learn not only how it&#8217;s made, but also about the different regions, grapes, techniques, vintages, and so on. This extra education has made it easier for me to identify a wine I&#8217;d probably like, from which regions, from which years, and so on. The net result is I&#8217;m able to find me some pretty darn good- <em>yet inexpensive </em>wine. I consider it a personal victory if I can find a truly awesome wine that lightens me by only $10-$15.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a little like this when searching for music production equipment. I get personal satisfaction from finding a great plugin or other gear that works perfectly for my needs, and it didn&#8217;t cost me an arm-and-leg. Case in point, I love my <a href="http://www.korgnano.com/">Korg nanoKONTROL</a>. I needed some hardware controllers, didn&#8217;t need much else, my nanoKONTROL was like $60. I also sold my <a href="http://www.akaipro.com/mpc1000">Akai MPC1000</a> and replaced it with <a href="http://www.native-instruments.com/#/en/products/producer/battery-3/">Native Instruments Battery 3</a> recently for $99, which netted me a profit <em>and</em> Battery works better with my rig. Win for me.</p>
<p>For this month&#8217;s DIY Studio topic, I&#8217;d like to turn it back to you and ask:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thinking about all your gear and software, what do you consider your best &#8220;win&#8221; as far as bang for the buck?</p></blockquote>
<p>Since we&#8217;re talking DIY, let&#8217;s see if we can keep it under $100, but if you have a great one <em>for the money</em>, don&#8217;t worry about going over. Let&#8217;s hear about it.</p>
<p>And also if you know of any great inexpensive wine on the market.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s your novel-length (but, I hope, exceedingly <em>valuable</em>!) provocation for the weekend… more of a self-assessment question, really:<strong> What does it cost you—in time <em>and</em> money—to write one minute of music?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an important thing to know, agreed? If, at the very least, we&#8217;re looking to break even (i.e., not have to pay for the privilege of writing music), we ought to know what kind of return we need on each minute we create.</p>
<p>You can get as granular as you want with this, but I think starting with a broad-strokes approach is acceptable for our purposes. And it&#8217;ll give you a good sense of how to budget and schedule… making it <em>topical</em> for our month-long SCOREcast feature.</p>
<div>
<div>Let&#8217;s start with the <strong>music</strong> itself. Calculate a rough estimate of how many minutes of music you create in an average year… going back five years, adding up all the minutes of music you&#8217;ve created, and dividing by five. This is your <strong>Yearly Average Production</strong>(YAP, for those of you who like acronyms).You can base your YAP on a single year, by the way, instead of going back five years. But I do recommend going back, especially if you&#8217;ve been doing this for a while. The busy years and the lean years will sort of cancel out that way. If you&#8217;re just getting started, you might want to include only your most recent year. Whatever number seems most accurate and meaningful to you… moving forward we&#8217;ll call that number <em>X</em>.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s look at <strong>time</strong>. Add up all the minutes you spend on your music—including the whole staring-out-the-window part (on this whole topic of time I will have more, much more to say in &#8220;View from the Trenches,&#8221; next Wednesday. Shameless self-promotion in play!). Add <em>X</em> years&#8217; worth of minutes, divide by <em>X</em>, and you have a nice average yearly number… your <strong>Yearly Estimated Time Investment</strong> (YETI).</p>
</div>
<div>For the <em>money</em> side of the equation, it&#8217;s the same thing: Go back <em>X</em> years. Add up all your studio expenses. Gear, of course… but also things like office equipment and supplies, career-related phone bills, iTunes purchases, rent/mortgage (for your studio, or an appropriate fraction of your rent/mortgage if you&#8217;re home-based). Basically, if you deduct it on your taxes as a business expense, include it here. A rough estimate will suffice. Divide that total by <em>X</em> to arrive at a <strong>Yearly Average Cost of Composing</strong> (YACC).</div>
<div>Now comes the part we&#8217;ve all been waiting for. Divide your YAM by your YETI to arrive at the actual time cost of a minute of music. Likewise, YAM/YACC yields the actual financial cost for you to create one minute of music. If you want to make a profit, that one minute has to generate more than YAM/YACC. And knowing YAM/YETI will tell you how much music you can reasonably create in a year&#8217;s time, when you devote the hours you choose to devote to your career.</div>
<div>
<p>By the way, please note here that we&#8217;re factoring in all the ancillary time-stuff as well… and that&#8217;s <em>so</em> important.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve talked before about &#8220;batting averages&#8221; and how long it takes to write one minute of music, but all of that was only in the context of <em>simply sitting down and writing</em>. This is different. Here we&#8217;re taking into account researching and purchasing gear, archiving files, poring over legal contracts, taking lunches with producers, etc. Both stats are important; each gives you a slightly different piece of data.</p>
</div>
<div>Here&#8217;s an example of how it all comes together. All numbers are fictitious, but reasonable for a full-time working composer.Meet Nigel Demiquaver. You all know Nigel for his fine score for the television series <em>The Dunes of My Spleen</em>. Great work, although that Emmy snub (nominated, but lost out to Bartholomew Phlegm… that hack!) was a bit of a scandal in the community a few months ago. Anyway, let&#8217;s run the numbers on Nigel and see what he needs to make per minute just to break even.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Music:</strong> Nigel is prolific. Phenomenally so: He&#8217;s scored 23 episodes of <em>Spleen</em> (avg. 20 min.s per episode) for each of the last five years, and he&#8217;s scored three feature-length films to boot (avg. 60 min.s per picture). That&#8217;s a total of 2,480 minutes of music. Let&#8217;s round up to 2,500 over the five years&#8217; time—throwing in a commercial here and there, and maybe a few minutes composed for, oh, a web series—for a colossal <strong>YAP</strong> of <strong>500 minutes</strong>.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> I&#8217;ll speed things up a bit by saying that, in an average year, Nigel spends 22 weeks in full-on &#8220;music mode&#8221;—brutal, 80-hour weeks. Another 18 weeks are spent in a less-intense mode (sending out demos, archiving, paperwork, writing a bit, etc.): 40-hour weeks for that time. Add an extra 20 miscellaneous hours over the rest of the year and it comes out to a nice, even and fairly true-to-life <strong>YETI</strong> of <strong>2,500 hours</strong>.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Money:</strong> Again, I&#8217;ll just give you yearly averages on all of this. There&#8217;s a lot to reckon with here, so bear with me. Nigel tries to stay current, spending an average of $10,000 a year just on hardware (new Macs &amp; PCs, plus the occasional mic or office chair or piece of outboard gear). He employs two assistants who cost $8,000 a year <em>each</em> to keep around (that would be something like 10 hours a week, every week, at $15 per hour, apiece). Each episode of <em>Spleen</em> (that&#8217;s 23 a year) costs an average $1,000 in musicians and engineers—and that&#8217;s an incredibly low number to plug in here—so we add another $23,000 to the yearly tally. $4,000 a year is Nigel&#8217;s investment in software and sample libraries, and the cost of his studio space is $36,000 per year (that&#8217;s a 1,500 square foot studio at $2 per square foot per month in rent… reasonable given LA costs these days). Utilities cost him $2000 for the year, and internet/website costs another $200.</p>
<p>Nigel kisses another $3,000 goodbye as he takes potential clients out to lunch, dinner, drinks and concerts (enjoyable, all—but a legitimate cost of doing business). Emmy night alone costs him nearly $1,000. He spends $600 per year in office supplies (toner cartridges ain&#8217;t cheap!); another $2,000 promoting himself online and in print; $500 for postage, overnight delivery, and messenger services… I&#8217;ll stop there, although the costs continue. You can see where this number is going, yes?<span style="font-weight: bold;"> YACC =<span style="font-weight: normal;"> <strong>$100,000</strong>.</span></span></p>
</div>
<div>None of these numbers are exact—and they don&#8217;t need to be—but they&#8217;re reasonably close to what you&#8217;d see in the real, professional world. And they do paint the picture. Do the math, and you can see that <strong><em>one minute of music, for Nigel, requires 5 hours and $200.</em></strong></div>
<div><strong><em><br />
</em></strong></div>
<div>If Nigel makes $600 per minute up front (i.e., his package for each TV episode is about $12,000), he&#8217;s already made $276,000 per year… but a package deal that handsome is increasingly rare in today&#8217;s world. Let&#8217;s cut it in half. Even at that—$138,000—he&#8217;s $38k toward having a life, paying taxes, etc. Royalties will vary wildly, but it&#8217;s reasonable to say that, if <em>Spleen</em> is a network or basic-cable show, he&#8217;ll see between $200-$400 per minute in back end (domestic and international) over the life cycle of the cue. That means somewhere between $100,000 and $200,000 more for Nigel per year. Makes that Emmy-less awards shelf a bit more bearable, doesn&#8217;t it? And it covers the cost of those three little movies he scored (which were sort of long-term investments anyway: he put the entire budget &#8220;into the scores,&#8221; making next to nothing so that, if the directors move ahead in the world, they might remember him and hire him for the Next Big Gig. Arguable whether that&#8217;s a winning strategy long-term, but that&#8217;s what he did).</div>
<div>Even if Nigel&#8217;s TV show were to air on a much smaller network, where per-minute royalties are substantially less, he stands to make reasonable coin if he keeps his writer&#8217;s share. He&#8217;ll make even more if he owns a percentage of the publishing royalties as well. But no show is forever (except maybe <em>The Simpsons</em>), and Nigel is going to have to save a hefty chunk of his income to tide him over during the inevitable slow times. His expenses during those lean periods are likely to go up if he&#8217;s hustling for gigs, using the down time to re-vamp and re-outfit his studio, creating demo cues for projects, etc. Counterintuitive, but true. There is an economy of scale here: the magnitude of these numbers may not be applicable to your career (yet!), but the factors to consider are almost all the same.</div>
<div><em><span style="font-style: normal;">The consequences and value of having your own version of all this information, I think, is evident. I don&#8217;t really need to know your YAP, your YETI or your YACC… but you should. And I </span>would<span style="font-style: normal;"> like to know what you think of this approach. I&#8217;d especially like to know if your own &#8220;magic numbers&#8221; come as a surprise!</span></em><em><span style="font-style: normal;">Jump on the calculator, crunch some numbers, and then jump on the COMMENTS.</span></em></p>

This is a classic project management conundrum that plagues stakeholders in all industries. The idea behind it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can have a high quality product quickly, but it will be expensive.</li>
<li>You can have a high quality product cheaply, but you won&#8217;t get it quickly.</li>
<li>You can put out a product quickly and cheaply, at the expense of quality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course you have stakeholders (and in this context that would be Directors, execs, etc.) who would look at the above and say &#8220;Nonsense. Give me all three.&#8221; Even so, I&#8217;d like your tips and stories on how to communicate &#8220;Good, Fast, Cheap: Pick Two&#8221; productively and to the satisfaction of everyone involved- or at least as close to satisfaction as possible.</p>

Hope you&#8217;re <em>laboring</em> on something inspiring and energizing.</p>
<div>In the true spirit of WP, it&#8217;s time to take some potshots at this month&#8217;s theme.</p>
<p>Provocation: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Composers should work without schedules and/or budgets.</span><br />
<strong><br />
</strong><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">…obvious, right? Turning the whole thing on its head and seeing what shakes out before we get too far into this month&#8217;s (sure-to-be-<em>killer</em>) content.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Schedules and budgets are what keep us in line. They routine our work hours; they constrain our dreams of 100-piece orchestras. But maybe, just maybe, there&#8217;s something valuable in considering what might be… if we weren&#8217;t so constrained. One that strikes me straightaway is this: <em>Filmmakers don&#8217;t care about your gear</em>.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">If you&#8217;re working with a Casio keyboard and a 4-track, you&#8217;ll still be subjected to a straight A-B comparison with people who have banks and banks of humming machinery (not to mention orchestras) to bring to bear on the task of making music. So in this sense, you <em>must</em> create a product that is without schedule or budget. That doesn&#8217;t apologize for its limitations.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">What else does this provocation bring to mind? I can&#8217;t wait to read your thoughts… jump in and let&#8217;s make it an <em>active</em> holiday weekend here at SCOREcast!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">(P.S. If you&#8217;ve commented here and you&#8217;re still jonesing to make your voice heard, check out Brian Satterwhite&#8217;s excellent—and very provocative—<a href="../../../2009/09/why-does-film-need-music.html">article</a>. I&#8217;d love to read everyone&#8217;s thoughts on that one, as well).</span></span></p>

You know the kind: &#8220;Here&#8217;s the hard, bitter truth about [insert choice of profession here].&#8221;</p>
<p>The way I see it, more cold water (cold <em>ink</em>?) is simply unnecessary. You know the long hours required to improve, to get your name out there, to advance in this career. You&#8217;re already aware that the odds of making a decent living as a composer are comparable to the odds of becoming a pro athlete. You know that fame and glamour are overrated; besides, they&#8217;re all but non-existent in our little corner of the music world. And none of that is why you write music anyway. You do it because you have to. There&#8217;s no choice in the matter.</p>
<div>On the other hand, it&#8217;s important to know the terrain. And there I think I can help—although it <em>is</em> going to feel a little… hypothermic… for a while. So let&#8217;s just jump in and get used to it. Then we can start talking about how to swim.</p>
<p>In the year 2009, the value of most television music is <strong>zero</strong> (<em>brrr</em>… chilly). That is to say, if you&#8217;re just starting out (or even if you&#8217;re established!) the kinds of gigs where you can get music placed immediately and actually used on TV no longer pay money up front. You&#8217;ll likely be creating and submitting music library cues—thus, not even writing to picture!—and there will be no front-end compensation for your time, energy, love or gear investment.</p>
<p>I know, because in the last week I&#8217;ve been offered precisely this gig—twice. One e-mail was from a producer on a Top 10 network television show. You&#8217;d know the name if I said it.</p>
<p>This producer actually had the audacity to write: &#8220;Unfortunately we cannot pay any up front money but if we end up using your music in the show you would receive royalties on the back end.&#8221; His reluctance to insert commas makes the sentence read as though he&#8217;s trying to get it all out in one breath—as though if he took the time to breathe, the sheer ridiculousness of what he&#8217;s asking would dawn on him and he&#8217;d delete his request in shame.</p>
<p>Except there&#8217;s no shame here. These offers are being made with a straight face… and to much more experienced and accomplished composers than Yours Truly. So I didn&#8217;t take it personally. I simply referred both these correspondents to a colleague of mine. I&#8217;ve partnered with this particular colleague on a music library project, and every once in a while (when things are slow around our studios) we&#8217;ll kick out a couple of tracks. Over the last several months we&#8217;ve accumulated a pretty decent library as a result… all solid stuff, all completely owned by us and available to license again and again and again.</p>
<p>So, when that lowball network TV offer came in, it required zero energy to deliver to this producer (who is a potential New Contact—crappy deal offer aside, that has value down the road!) the kind of music he needed. High-quality, high-volume, no commitment. My colleague has agreed to handle all the contract stuff and the technical aspects of delivery, and I&#8217;ve agreed that he&#8217;ll get a little more of whatever money the library brings in.</p>
<p>Sad to say the two of us are getting a <em>lot</em> of these kinds of e-mails lately. We&#8217;ve been asked to submit our library to <em>nine shows</em> in the last month alone—and that, my friends, constitutes a <em>trend</em>.</p>
<p>If what I&#8217;ve just described could be seen as a frontal assault on our revenue stream, get ready for more bad news: our rear is also under attack (I know, I know… mixing metaphors: water and warfare. You can handle it). Two cable networks <em>that I know of</em> are attempting to negotiate composer contracts that take away 50% of writer&#8217;s share royalties (presumably assigning them to an entity representing the network, so that the score for their shows are even more of a net money-maker for them). They&#8217;re trying this primarily with less-established composers at present; if they succeed, however, it&#8217;s a safe bet that they&#8217;ll consider this Standard Operating Procedure in future contract negotiations.</p>
<p>Scary stuff. Seriously. Even scarier when you consider that they could take out an ad on Craigslist tomorrow and get hundreds of demo packages from hungry, hopeful composers. If we&#8217;re talking cold water here, this scenario is a scene straight out of <em>Titanic</em>. Post-iceberg.</p>
<div>So how can you survive the squeeze? And what does all of this bad news portend for the future of music in television?</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are a few bright spots. We&#8217;ve talked before (in the comments) about the handful of television shows that still allow for a live orchestra; the fact that those shows are perennial Emmy front-listers bodes well for perceptive producers and network executives. It may be true that, to get on the playing field in the TV music game, you only need to be about a &#8220;five&#8221; on a scale of ten, but the quality difference becomes obvious when it&#8217;s time to hand out little gold statues.</p>
<p>The next bright spot: the proliferation of channels out there. Five hundred channels, and they all need music. In most cases they&#8217;re not willing to pay much, but the opportunities to get at least some experience in the medium has never been greater. If the Industry still contains even a teensy little particle of meritocracy (and I think it does), the sheer volume of music required means that great new composers have a legitimate chance to rise… make connections… get noticed. And move upward and onward to the gigs they deserve.</p>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s important to note that producers and execs for <em>scripted</em> television, particularly in the realm of premium television channels such as HBO, Showtime and others, still care enough to fight for proper composer compensation—and even niceties like reasonable composer schedules. Those producers care about quality, and are still dedicated to the idea that the composer is a key member of the creative team. It&#8217;s a breath of fresh air to take meetings with these people.</p>
<p>But if you really want to &#8220;beat the game&#8221; of shrinking budgets and schedules and command the kind of respect that you&#8217;re due as a composer, here&#8217;s the most important technique I know. Make your network more than just a means to an end. Make your connections your friends. Make &#8217;em your <em>soulmates</em>. Make a real, personal bond with the people who will be hiring you. Do it as part of your long-term strategy… hell, do it as part of making your life better.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why: humans (and, believe it or not, most Hollywood players are, in fact, human—at least on some level) don&#8217;t screw over their friends. They take care of their in-group. Be part of that group.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a great line in an episode of <em>The West Wing</em> (just looked it up: it&#8217;s &#8220;The Black Vera Wang&#8221;) that&#8217;s stuck with me ever since I watched it for the first time: &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk to me like I&#8217;m other people.&#8221; I think that has some resonance here.</p>
<p>Many years ago, I wrote a fan letter to a TV composer. One of the things I asked him—after raving in obsessive detail about his scores—was whether he thought it was possible for someone like me, from the middle of nowhere, to make the trek out to Hollywood and get active in the business. Moreover, I wanted to know whether, with a bit of luck and as much hard work as required, I could expect to make a decent living at this career.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m from a small, solidly middle-class family with no friends or family in the Industry whatsoever. No safety net, no one to serve as a &#8220;rabbi&#8221; and introduce me around. I needed to know whether it was even possible to contemplate before diving in. Would the water simply be too cold—and me without a wetsuit?</p>
<p>The composer replied: &#8220;I think you&#8217;re just the kind of obsessed dreamer who actually has a shot. Eventually it comes down to some luck, but if you pay dues long enough, and if you&#8217;re fairly good, you&#8217;ll find work. And in TV all you need is one hit that goes five seasons and then into syndication. After that you can retire if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to tell you it&#8217;s all still true today, but that last part isn&#8217;t even close. Not anymore. Too much of the cost of creating the music (maintaining a world-class synth rig, mixing, paying for musicians, etc.) has been passed on to us as an ongoing expense, and the squeeze at both front- and back-end has made this career less of a dream and more just something to do for a living.</p>
<p>But like I said: we do it because we have to. That alone should warm up the water… at least a little. Or maybe we composers are just preternaturally fond of the cold.</p>

Hiring an assistant, however, is a process that you should take careful approach to. Here are some things to keep in mind.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Periodically, I get an email or a <a href="http://twitter.com/deaneogdenmusic">Tweet</a> asking me to reveal a little of my &#8220;workflow&#8221;—how I do what I do in my studio to achieve my goals. I will start by telling you that most of my smooth &#8220;workflow&#8221; as a busy composer is in place simply because I have help. Not all the time, but certainly <span style="font-style: italic;">some-of-the-time</span> composing for picture is a team sport. I have a solid team that I work with on virtually every picture to ensure that things go smoothly and there are no surprises. I try to hire the same score recordist and mixers, the same contractors, copyists, orchestrators, and studio assistants on each project so that I do not have to train and retrain people to the way that I like to work. My people know my process and I know theirs. It&#8217;s easy, it&#8217;s functional, and we work well together, often anticipating what each other is thinking. When we&#8217;ve conquered, we also party together afterward and celebrate our victory as a team. Those are great traits for a team to possess when you need people to function cohesively on a tight deadline and look forward to the next gig on down the line.</p>
<p>As time as gone by and my career has grown from where it was ten years ago to where it is now, I, like many of my colleagues, have made good practice of hiring assistants to help with various tasks that will help me get done what I need to get done. There are no excuses in filmmaking&#8230; no room for getting sick or forgetting something important. I&#8217;ve always known I was cut out for this work upon realizing early on that it&#8217;s not like any other job I&#8217;d ever had: You might not get fired for coming in overbudget or late on the deadline, but you almost certainly will never work for that person again.</p>
<p>Assistants can make or break you, really. As I always say, use me as a shortcut – I&#8217;ve learned the hard way. You have to be careful on several fronts. The first question you have to ask yourself is &#8220;Is NOW really the right time for me to hire an assistant?&#8221; Ask yourself if you are far enough a long in your career that the everyday routine hassles of maintaining your studio gear, upgrading your computer OS&#8217;s, doing cue sheets in Excel, and the myriad other things that we have to do as composers is taking time away from the actual very necessary task of daily composing a few minutes of finished music. If the answer is an honest &#8220;YES&#8221;, then it might be time to hire an assistant.</p>
<p>Hiring an assistant, however, is a process that you should take careful approach to. Make sure that you take plenty of time to think through the relationship that you&#8217;ll have with your employee (or intern, as the case may be).</p>
<p>Most likely, your assistant will be a student who is involved in the film scoring program at a nearby university or is finishing up junior college en route to a university program. Your screening process for this person should be pretty stout, as they will have intimate knowledge of the inner-workings of your professional AND personal lives (more on this later). Make sure that they are responsible, presentable, and articulate (the &#8220;articulate&#8221; thing is a personal pet-peeve of mine and I always go out of my way to make sure I select someone who communicates well, since this business is all about communicating, whether through musical or verbal presentation).</p>
<h3>Who assists?</h3>
<p>Be careful whom you choose. Make sure the person is trustworthy and comes with at least a few references from people vouching for that trustworthiness. I know it sounds over the top, but it is important to really scrutinize and thoroughly evaluate the person that you are bringing in — pretend that this person is ultimately a clone of YOU. When they speak, YOU are speaking; when they do something, YOU are doing it; when they act on something, YOU are acting on it. This person has to emulate you as closely as possible and do things in a manner by which YOU would do them. And they are always, ALWAYS, representing YOU.</p>
<p>It is tempting, like a lot of athletes or even recording artists do, to hire someone that you have a track record of trust with such as a family member. However, when they say, &#8220;Never work with family,&#8221; they mean it, and more often than not those kinds of arrangements don&#8217;t work out in the long run. Don&#8217;t be too emotionally attached to the person who is assisting you. It shouldn&#8217;t be a close friend, another colleague, and especially not a family member. It&#8217;s just too personal that way, and since you are the &#8220;boss&#8221; and they are the &#8220;underling,&#8221; the pecking order is lined out from the get-go, often spelling trouble down the line when feelings get hurt and people feel &#8220;talked down to&#8221;. The world of composing for film is simply too fast a swim to have to worry about whether you are causing a rift in your family every time you ask your dad to bring back lunch or sort through cable!</p>
<p>I have been criticized a lot for repeatedly hiring assistants that are fairly young – a couple of them have even been fresh out of high school. There are several reasons why I chose these young people. The first reason is that I believe people are individuals, and though age does play heavily into the level of maturity in a person, I&#8217;m not going to rule out someone who is a superstar based solely on how long they&#8217;ve been on Earth. If I give them an assignment, can I rest assured that it will be done in a timely manner and that they will do an excellent job? The answer to that is only part of my criteria for hiring someone, but it is a huge part of it. To me, professionalism and dependability are more important than whether or not a person is in college and working out what their dissertation will be about.</p>
<p>The second reason I am okay with hiring young people that are in school is that I rarely need a full-time assistant. Often times, I only need someone when my workload is so huge that I simply run out of time to write two to three minutes of finished music a day and accomplish all of the necessary routine business items on my punch list. I need someone who can take care of all of that for me so that I can be left alone to simply write the score for the film — which is what I have been hired to do by the producers of every project I have ever worked on (I&#8217;ve never been hired to run to OfficeMax and get supplies, shuttle drives back and forth, or get my computer systems serviced at the Melrose Mac!). The fact that these youngsters were just starting college and could only work at my studio from 4pm until 8pm was perfect for me and allowed me an entire day of the peace and quiet I require while I&#8217;m at the writing desk. At the same time, those four to five hours of administrative tasks still were completed daily and that also allowed me to get home at a decent time and catch my breath with my family every night.</p>
<p>Lastly, I just like mentoring young people who have an interest in this crazy business. I often think back on the early stages of my own career and wish I had known someone who would have taken me under their wing and showed me the ropes a bit. I&#8217;ve spent so much of my time as a working composer trying to avoid reinventing the wheel, and it just would have been nice to have someone who could have shown me the path of least resistance in several areas of the learning journey. I want to be that resource for young composers coming up, and I&#8217;ve come to learn that music takes hold in most young people when they are in grade school, as it did me. Additionally, college entrants are eager to learn and haven&#8217;t yet figured out that you are supposed to act like you have it all together. They ask questions when they don&#8217;t understand something and they want to do a good job because they don&#8217;t want to let you down. It&#8217;s not about money or power or prestige for them quite yet. Instead, they are still in it for the love of the game – its about music, art, and creativity. Those are the kind of people I want on my team.</p>
<p>As I look foward to the next two parts of this series, I want to know what you all think. If you are a composer and you have thought before about hiring someone to help out in your studio, but you weren&#8217;t sure if you should take the plunge or not, let me know. Ask me questions, Let&#8217;s start the conversation. I have had four assistants in my career thusfar. One of them was not so great, while the other three were complete ass kickers. One was a female while the other three were guys, and interestingly enough, the female was probably the best out of all of them — my current assistant is great friends with her, and he&#8217;d be the first to tell you that.</p>
<p>So jump in on the Comments section below and let me hear what your concerns, observations, and questions are about hiring an assistant to accelerate and simplify your workflow. I&#8217;ll be here answering as feverishly as I can, and I&#8217;m anxious to hear what the community has to say.</p>

My gosh, I thought, there are so many, and they all just blur together, I can&#8217;t think of any in particular.</p>
<p>But no.  There <span style="font-style: italic;">is </span>one that stands out.  I&#8217;m almost embarrassed to talk about it, because it goes <span style="font-style: italic;">so </span>far back, to 1961.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Side_Story_%28film%29"><span style="font-style: italic;">West Side Story</span></a> &#8211; scored by <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Bernstein" title="Leonard Bernstein" rel="wikipedia">Leonard Bernstein</a>.</p>
<p>Now, <span style="font-style: italic;">West Side Story</span> wasn&#8217;t originally a film &#8212; it was a Broadway musical, based on a novel, in turn based on <span style="font-style: italic;">Romeo and Juliet</span>.  But it was a <span style="font-style: italic;">huge</span> success when it came to the screen, winning 10 Academy Awards, not to mention blowing me away.  <span style="font-style: italic;">West Side Story </span>was really different from anything I&#8217;d ever seen or heard.  One of those 70 mm spectacles that you don&#8217;t see these days.  The dancing was really cool, and the lyrics outrageous, but it was Bernstein&#8217;s<span style="font-style: italic;"> music </span>that really stuck with me.  Even today, almost half a century later (is that possible?), I still remember the most minute details.</p>
<p>But, unlike many of my fellow SCOREcast contributors, I <span style="font-style: italic;">didn&#8217;t</span> immediately think, <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>I gotta write music like that, gotta be a film composer</span>.  At that time, I wanted to be a <span style="font-style: italic;">singer</span>, and Bernstein&#8217;s music just kind of hit me in the pit of my stomach.  A lot of it was <span style="font-style: italic;">hormones</span>, I think &#8212; stars in my eyes.  After all, I was about 13 when <span style="font-style: italic;">West Side Story</span> came out.  I wanted to be &#8230; <span style="font-style: italic;">Tony</span>.  And, of course, I imagined myself singing to the likes of <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000081/" title="Natalie Wood" rel="imdb">Natalie Wood</a> (Maria).</p>
<p>My high school put on a musical every year, and I kept hoping the music department would decide to do <span style="font-style: italic;">West Side Story</span> and that I&#8217;d get the chance to be Tony, even if I wasn&#8217;t playing opposite Natalie.  It didn&#8217;t come to pass.</p>
<p>But I kept hoping.  I had a copy of the soundtrack album, and I went over and over the songs.  One 60&#8217;s morning around 10 AM, when I thought nobody was home, I was <span style="font-style: italic;">being</span> Tony, singing <span style="font-style: italic;">Maria</span> at the top of my lungs when, to my extreme embarassment, I heard somebody yell, &#8220;Will ya shut up, I&#8217;m trying to sleep!&#8221;  Sorry, Dad.</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s interesting to learn that I was in good company in my quest to become Tony.   According to <span style="font-style: italic;">Wikipedia, </span>when the part of Tony was being cast for the film, the list of eager contenders included <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000062/" title="Elvis Presley" rel="imdb">Elvis Presley</a>, Warren Beatty, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002147/" title="Tab Hunter" rel="imdb">Tab Hunter</a>, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000578/" title="Anthony Perkins" rel="imdb">Anthony Perkins</a>, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0848560/" title="Russ Tamblyn" rel="imdb">Russ Tamblyn</a>, Burt Reynolds, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001148/" title="Troy Donahue" rel="imdb">Troy Donahue</a>, Bobby Darin, Richard Chamberlain, Gary Lockwood, and <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000937/" title="Richard Beymer" rel="imdb">Richard Beymer</a>.  Beymer was eventually selected.]</p>
<p>Things have a way of morphing over time.  I ended up going off in a completely non-musical direction in the years that followed, with Tony locked up somewhere inside.  I didn&#8217;t re-emerge until several decades had passed and I realized I had to let him out &#8212; that it wasn&#8217;t too late.  It was then &#8212; about 10 years ago &#8212; that a new musical journey began for me.  No, I probably wasn&#8217;t going to be Tony, but I could still <span style="font-style: italic;">create </span>music that moved me the way I&#8217;d been moved so many years before.  I began to put the pieces together, one after another, until it dawned on me that composing for film and other media was a viable as a new career path.  The rest is history still in the making.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">There&#8217;s a time for us &#8230;</span>            </p>
