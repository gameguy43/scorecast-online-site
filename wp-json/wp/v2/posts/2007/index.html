The industry we work in demands a lot. Time pressure, the need to stand out, to have a unique voice and most of all the actual need to come up with something good at all means we have to stay on top of our game as best as we can. One piece of the puzzle that has become ever more important in recent years is having a template. This article is the first part of a series dealing with exactly that. We will have a look at what a template actually is and why you should want to have one (or more). We will deal with the technology behind it (part II), some software to make it reality (part III) and how to approach building one for yourself (part IV). The journey does not end here, though. Based on your feedback, this series will continue with additional topics. So, after reading this first part, voice your thoughts and questions in the comments.<\/p>\n<h2>What is a template?<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019re sitting in front of your composing desk and have just read a brief. You\u2019ve even managed to get a few ideas how to pull this off. You start up your sequencer, load in an instrument track, add an instance of your sampler, think of a nice patch to start with, load it in and begin playing. No, actually you don\u2019t. Because by the time you have finally loaded everything, you have completely forgotten your brilliant musical idea. Its gone. *He\u2019s dead, Jim!* Does this sound familiar? Hand up, please, everyone who has been in that situation. I sure have.<\/p>\n<p>What if you were able to just play away when that bolt of inspiration strikes? How awesome would that be? That\u2019s what templates are for. Simply put, a template in its most basic form is nothing more than a project in your sequencer which is already populated with a number of tracks containing instruments\/articulations that you rely on all the time. So instead of having to create a track, loading Kontakt, searching for that string patch and loading it in, all you need to do is select a track and you\u2019re good to go. Whenever you start a new project, instead of loading an empty session in your sequencer, you load a copy of your template.<\/p>\n<h2>What is in there?<\/h2>\n<p>You probably have a favourite piano patch. Maybe you even routinely use one when looking for inspiration. Just noodling away on one patch until you a nice tune creeps up is an important part of the creative process. Similarly, you have a favourite string library; that one particular trumpet patch; or even that big whooping bass synth sound that sculpts the low end of your tracks. Especially in the orchestral realm, over time as a composer you will build \u201eyour orchestra\u201c out of the various sample libraries you have purchased. This line-up stays relatively consistent between projects. Just have a look at your music and you will see that you have some preferences. All these patches have their place in your template. Being able to access them without first needing to load them in allows you to be creative the second you sit down at your composing desk. Furthermore, it obviously saves you a lot of time starting with a pre-populated arrange instead of having to load in the same stuff on every new cue.<\/p>\n<h2>Do it once, have it for eternity<\/h2>\n<p>Saving time actually is one of the main reasons why taking the time to set up a template makes sense: Things like routing, possibly stems, reverb setup and basic post-production are more or less the same on most tracks. If you use samples that need panning to sound realistic, those settings tend to stay the same in different projects. In a regular orchestral setup, the Violins I are panned quite a bit to the left, the Trumpets are more in the back to the right of the conductor. Using these settings you spent considerable time to set up and tweak in other projects not only makes sense, but also lets you be more productive. A template allows you to set everything up the way you need it and create new projects based on that work later.<\/p>\n<p>The same applies to changes to patches. You might change CC assignments to make something work with your wind controller. Or map instrument parameters to knobs on your controller keyboard to be able to control them while recording. Having all this saved as part of your template makes sure it is exactly as you want it every time you begin a new project.<\/p>\n<p>Last but not least, having everything set up in this way also helps with mixing: Different sample libraries have different relative volume levels. If you take the time once to adjust the volume of all patches relative to each other, you won\u2019t need to work your faders so much anymore to get instruments to sound good together. Making sure the relative volume of different instruments is as close to the real thing as possible is an important part of creating realistic mockups.<\/p>\n<h2>What is not in there?<\/h2>\n<p>That\u2019s an easy one! All those patches you only use on very specific projects are better of being project-specific, i.e. not being loaded as part of the template. This is to save loading time for the whole thing and to avoid having a large number of tracks that you only use once a year. So maybe this (admittedly gorgeous) baroque Viola d\u2019amore patch might be better left out \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<h2>Manage your arsenal<\/h2>\n<p>Having a template ready also is a way to make sure you actually use the samples you\u2019ve got. Ever caught yourself just loading a generic string patch for noodling around and then ending up with that exact same patch in the final version, just because you couldn\u2019t be bothered to look for a better one? A template with a variety of different patches for various uses lets you find the patch that fits best. It also invites you to toy around with instrumentation: How about giving that line to the Flute? Nah, that sucks, Oboe sounds better! Since all instruments are already there and you don\u2019t need to create a new track or change an existing one to try out some other instrument, you can easily test different instrumentations.<\/p>\n<p>Picture a template like a toolset. It provides you with quick access to all the instruments and patches you need, completely set up with your CC assignments, routing, reverb, and so on. In its most basic form, a template saves you time and makes sure you can begin writing quicker.<\/p>\n<h2>What does it require?<\/h2>\n<p>A template by its very nature contains a lot of tracks, not all of which you will use in every project. All these samples nevertheless need to be loaded, so hosting a large template first and foremost demands a lot of RAM. While it is possible to remove unused samples from memory, the bare patches still need some memory when loaded. But unless you are really low on memory, having a template far outweighs the disadvantages. It takes some time to plan a template and to set it up. We will deal with that part in a later article, but just so you know: This ain\u2019t nothing to be done in a few hours. Some very good news at the end: The monetary requirements are as low as it can get. While it makes sense to use specialised software to host the template, this is not a must &#8211; and even if you do use this software, it is not very expensive. We will deal with all that in detail later. You can set up a basic template in your sequencer with no additional software or hardware required.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I hope you found this article interesting. Part II will deal with the technical background of setting up a template and the various approaches to it.
