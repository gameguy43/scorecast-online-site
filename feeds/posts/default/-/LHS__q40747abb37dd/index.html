Why deny myself the (sometimes) glorious royalties that come from a wall-to-wall score? And doesn't \"writing as little music as possible\" sound, well, kinda of \u003ci\u003elazy\u003c/i\u003e?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMy rationale, and more… after the jump.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca name\u003d'more'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt's simple, really: If my default position is \u003ci\u003enot\u003c/i\u003e to score a scene, then including music becomes a conscious choice. In other words, I prefer to build in a decision point, right from the spotting session, in which there must be a argument for music.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWorking this way means the music has a better chance of being target-specific, rather than ubiquitous. It has a better chance of heightening the experience by its presence (and absence!), rather than simply serving as what it's often called: sonic wallpaper.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI say \"has a better chance,\" because working this way usually leads to conflict with filmmakers. You might be surprised how many filmmakers walk into a spotting sessions with the assumption that everything will be scored.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOnce, at a spotting session several years ago, I was even flat-out told: \"Just write music for the entire picture, and we'll throw out all the cues that aren't working.\"\u0026nbsp;Which was both refreshingly honest and casually insulting. When I launched into my whole \"concept of spotting\" spiel… you guessed it. Funny looks.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMaybe I was being \"too meta\" for them, talking about a philosophical framework… in fact, I can guarantee it. It's an understandable thing to want to do, but it's a telltale sign of inexperience. A rookie mistake.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHere's why:\u003cbr /\u003eOpening the door of talking about process can be counterproductive, even dangerous. Never more so than at a spotting session. It can erode the filmmakers' confidence in you. It can lead to blanket statements like \"I want you to score everything,\" out of a desire to cut to the chase. \"Process\" conversations, I've come to believe, are best left to cocktail hour… long after the gig is finished. They're abstract at a moment when you ought to be dealing in the concrete; they're speculative and introspective at a moment when you need to be definitive and self-assured. You're being hired for your opinion, not for out-loud musings about how you reach that opinion.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eA spotting session, as filmmaker meetings go, is a long one: it's at least the length of the picture (…right? Don't tell me you allow the filmmakers to \"skip to the next part where we're gonna have music\"!). Keeping things focused, setting a brisk pace, is an important precedent for your subsequent playback meetings.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAll of which is why I've adopted a \"just (don't) do it\" approach to spotting, in which I simply remain silent until I feel music is required. If, before that moment, the filmmaker asks \"…we're gonna have music here, right?,\" I can reply with a question: \"Why?\"\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis little verbal jujitsu move, if done in a friendly, genuinely-curious way, leads into the discussion I want to be having, within the frame in which I want to place it. And if the filmmaker offers up some obviously-just-concocted justification, it doesn't matter: you're still having the conversation. You're still taking part in the creative collaboration. Which means you're in a position to talk it over. And maybe, just maybe, change your own opinion. None of this should be construed as closed-mindedness.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe spotting process is under fire, in my view, and not just from people like the score-happy filmmaker I mentioned above. Projects for which a music library is used—which, I don't have to tell you, are more and more prevalent—don't even \u003ci\u003ehave\u003c/i\u003e spotting sessions. It's usually assumed those projects will be wall-to-wall.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOn more traditional projects, temp tracks often fall into place long before a composer is set. The spotting decisions made as the temp is assembled become a kind of default unto themselves. If we composers disagree, we have to fight harder than ever even to reach a place where we're deemed worthy of being allowed to voice an opinion on the subject. It's a moment in the creative process that, frankly, is in very real danger of falling out of our jurisdiction.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThat's a shame—it results in a shallower collaboration between filmmaker and composer, and in my opinion, a weaker end product. If I'm completely against the idea of placing music in a scene in the first place, how inspired am I really going to be when it comes time to score it? Besides, I've spent my whole career honing a dramatic sensitivity… a huge part of which is knowing how and when to enter and exit a scene. It's part of my identity as a (musical) storyteller. It's something I bring to the party. I think that deserves a hearing, and I encourage you to be similarly confident and persistent in your own spotting sessions.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd if you \u003ci\u003estill\u003c/i\u003e get funny looks from your filmmaking collaborators? Ignore 'em. If you're right, they'll come around.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI want to hear some spotting session success stories… and nightmares… from people this month! The more we all share, the better prepared we are when we walk into our own sessions. So bring it on. The crazier the better.

Sure, I do my best work every time out, just like you all do, but you know what I mean. Some gigs just get under your skin. There's something there that makes you want to knock it out of the park… show the world what you can do… get off your rear end and write the Great American Film Score.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAll of which is usually followed by a sudden feeling of creative nausea. Musical constipation. Call it what you will—lots of people have called it lots of things, usually invoking some sort of unsavory gastrointestinal metaphor.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eInstead of writing music, you're \u003ci\u003ethinking\u003c/i\u003e about writing music.

He sat down at his piano and mentally let go of the whole cue for a little while. He played through a bunch of tunes he knew well, and knew he knew how to \u003ci\u003eplay\u003c/i\u003e well, just for enjoyment and distraction. Just to allow his mind to decompress a bit and regain its footing.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHe was jamming along to an up-tempo gospel tune when the tape machine (now *that* dates this story, doesn't it?) automatically reached the end of its pause-timer and resumed playing that cattle-rustling scene.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs the story goes, Shaiman looked at the now-unpaused video, and heard the music he was playing on the piano, and the two just… fit. He knew exactly how he was going to score the scene. Copland's ghost was banished (either to a Mexican salon or an Appalachian spring, one supposes), and Shaiman got back to work.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI didn't want to end this month of competition with the cliché about your toughest competition being yourself—there are a whole \u003ci\u003elot\u003c/i\u003e of us composers out there now, and some of us are pretty damned good!

This problem is due to the SCOREcast server at Gcast (where we've posted our podcast since birth) becoming too overloaded with traffic.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSimply put, Gcast never anticipated the major popularity of several of their podcast clients, including us, and so they have been forced to start shutting things off starting February 1st. While we have been talking with them and they are leaving our podcast hosting intact until we choose our next home, you might experience issues with older podcast episodes (including episodes that \"cut off\" in the middle of the broadcast), to which we truly do apologize.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOur solution is to work with a new company that is a leader in podcast distribution and make our podcasts available in even more outlets, to more composers and film music pros across the globe.

Where we might do better to unclench a bit. Go with the flow. Let it come to us, rather than launching ourselves at it all gung-ho and crazy-eyed.\u003cbr /\u003eWhat I found, after the jump.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca name\u003d'more'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eFirst off,\u003c/b\u003e I find a lot of composers these days (particularly composers who are just getting started) with their fingers on the trigger of the\u0026nbsp;\u003ci\u003espam cannon.\u003c/i\u003e They're just blasting away, firing off demo packages to anyone and everyone who might have an active e-mail account. Filmmakers? Sure. They get demos… but so do music library companies, music supervisors, music editors, studio/network execs, and anyone else whose Hollywood Creative Directory listing seems to touch even marginally on the subject of organized sound waves. There's often little or no follow-through involved—it's all about hitting the maximum number of targets \u003ci\u003eonce\u003c/i\u003e. That, to them, constitutes being a tough, aggressive competitor. But that's not just being overly competitive; it's also competing in the wrong thing.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI receive plenty of these e-mails myself; usually it's from well-intentioned folks who really want to get a foot in a door (mine). The truth of the matter is this: If I don't know you, I'm not going to hire you. And getting to know someone, in my opinion, takes a little time. If the only correspondence we've had is the one e-mail you sent with links to your website and your work—and if that e-mail ends with something like \"please give me a call or an e-mail so that we can discuss how much money you'll be paying me,\" you're pretty much hosed before you even got started. It's a turn-off. You're making me feel like I'm just a sub-boss monster in the video game of your life. And you're gonna blast me with your spam cannon and get onto the next level. I'm not that easy… and neither are most filmmakers.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI like meeting new people, especially music people, and even more especially music people who are \u003ci\u003eon fire\u003c/i\u003e to get their careers going. But a little unclenching in this particular department works wonders. Building relationships takes time… at its best, it happens organically. And trying to force those relationships—looking at them too much like they're something to be shooting your way through, rather than nurturing and enjoying—is, to my way of thinking, over-competitive.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eNext up: gear.\u003c/b\u003e We've talked about GAS (Gear Acquisition Syndrome) around here before, and I freely admit to succumbing from time to time. What I sometimes find, though, is film music pros snapping up a whole new array of toys merely out of a desire to race in the Gear Derby. Again, it's competing in the wrong event.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI'm not suggesting that it's not important to stay up on the latest stuff; it definitely is. But it's a means to an end. And there's a pacing to the thing: it ought to be at a level commensurate with the gigs you're actually getting (and if you simply \u003ci\u003emust\u003c/i\u003e compare and compete, do so with those peers who are at your own level).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI'd love to have a brand spanking new Euphonix or SSL console; who wouldn't? But I don't need it. It's way out of profile with where I am in my career. And the fact that (insert A-lister here) just bought one, or five, or whatever, shouldn't really bear on my decision. If I let it, I'm allowing my urge to compete over my head put the rest of my finances in jeopardy. And that's dumb. I don't need any more machinery to legitimize what I do.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMy take on this: put the blinders on, run your own race, and unclench. When you need gear, get the best you can afford and no more. (it's enough to have to spend just doing that!)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eLast thought for now: \u003c/b\u003eThere are all sorts of aspects of this biz in which thinking of the struggle as a competition can be healthy. It spurs us on to do more than we might be inclined to otherwise. It takes us out of the safe, familiar zone where no growth occurs. It gives us definitive, often-humbling feedback about how we're progressing.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut competing over who can go the longest without sleeping, or who has neglected their family and friends the longest, or even who can write the craziest number of minutes of music in a day? Somewhere in there is that oft-mentioned line between hard-ass and dumb-ass. Tread carefully. Run the right race. Don't let your hardcore composer status become an end unto itself.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLurkers—here's a great chance to pitch in your own thoughts. I'd love to hear what you think on this one. What have I missed? Are there other areas where we're all guilty of getting too amped-up, \u003ci\u003etoo\u003c/i\u003e competitive?

Your people skills are honed, crisp and extra-sparkly. You've targeted a few level-appropriate projects, and maybe one or two \"long-shot\" gigs, just to start getting higher-ups familiar with your work. Your phone calls are getting returned, and the gatekeepers seem ready to say the magic word—\u003cb\u003eyes\u003c/b\u003e.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThen, one by one, those gigs just… slip away. \u003ca href\u003d\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory\"\u003eBlack swans\u003c/a\u003e start cropping up in your work life—unforeseen interlopers that threaten to swoop in and snatch the fruits of victory out of your hands.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhat—and who—are these \u003cb\u003eunexpected competitors\u003c/b\u003e? Knowing about them—and how to compete with them—should be an integral part of your game plan. So let's take a look, after the jump.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca name\u003d'more'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e1. The Budget Composer.\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis person's a vulture—preying on productions whose budgets are tight. He swoops in fast and lowballs everyone else off the table. Sure, it's no way to earn a living in the long-term. Budget Composer is hoping to cement a relationship with the filmmakers, though, so that he'll be a lock for the next gig (and, through some sort of magical process, the filmmakers will decide he's worth a lot more money next time around).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTwo problems with this approach: first, \"lowball\" has come to mean \u003ci\u003ezero\u003c/i\u003e. And it takes real creativity to get below that (of course, some composers are now striking deals to give away their royalties, in effect literally paying for the privilege of writing music).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSecond, chasing an expanded music budget on the next gig is like chasing the horizon. It's out there, tantalizing you but never coming within reach. Take it from me. It's not going to happen. Not if you do a standout job with the budget you have. Think of it like a producer: Why would you pay more for the same product—especially when the person providing that product desperately\u0026nbsp;\u003ci\u003eneeds\u003c/i\u003e the gig?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI think the best tactic against Budget Composer is to take the high line. Know what you cost. Don't deviate from it. And if you do deviate from it, make it clear up front that the filmmakers are getting a x score (where x is the rate you've chosen for yourself) for y dollars (where y is the amount you're agreeing to), and that this special one-time offer won't be repeated. You will lose gigs this way, but my take on it is that they're predatory gigs to begin with. If \"low cost\" is the sole criterion (or even the #1 criterion) for choosing a composer, then you have to wonder about the filmmakers' priorities elsewhere in the show. And you have to ask yourself if you want to spend the rest of your career on your knees, begging for every extra penny.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBy the way, if this gig is for someone with whom you have an existing track record—i.e, if they already know your rate and have paid it in the past—you might be wise to take any offer of this sort to be a relationship-threatening insult. Unless everyone on board is taking a hit just to do the project (and the filmmakers are taking a bigger hit than anyone else!)… and even then I'd advise you to be wary.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf your standing (social \u003ci\u003eand\u003c/i\u003e professional) with the filmmakers is solid, though, I still claim that you'll have some general protection because of the rule that states: people generally don't screw over their friends. Sure, it happens… but less often than you think. Keep those relationships right and tight, and you'll find out for yourself.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e2. The Music Supervisor.\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhen the position of music supervisor was first imagined, it pertained almost exclusively to the domain of \u003ci\u003esongs\u003c/i\u003e in films. Now music supervisors have begun to assert jurisdiction over the score-selection process as well. In addition to presenting a \"short list\" of songs and/or artists to be considered for placement in a film or television project, they often recommend one or more composers for the gig. And their recommendations, increasingly, are carrying weight. Not just with individual filmmakers, but with networks and studios as well. The model is evolving: in a growing number of cases your demo will have to go through a music supervisor before it's even mentioned to any other gatekeepers.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis additional middleman can save the filmmakers an immense amount of time—and never more so than in today's composer-saturated environment. We've talked before about the hundreds—literally hundreds—of demos that land on the desks of filmmakers for each and every gig. Giving all those demos legitimate consideration really is a full-time job.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOf course, if you have a pre-existing relationship with those other gatekeepers, you can communicate with them directly, regardless of whether a music supervisor is in the picture. And if you're friendly with the music supervisor, you may find yourself with a powerful ally in the competition to land a gig. You might even get a call out of the blue from a music supervisor, letting you know he or she is recommending you for a job!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo, while this additional layer of 'triage' does nudge composers a little further from the heart of the creative team, it also presents opportunities for you to enlist other Industry professionals as your evangelists. It's all in making those connections.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e3. The Music Library House.\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf you're writing any sort of library music, this is your dilemma. The production companies that make these shows are less and less inclined to speak with individual composers. It's just too much of a hassle to pick up a few dozen cues here and there. They simply don't have the time… or the budget to pay someone to hassle with the phone calls and e-mails and downloads and paperwork.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eReality shows today deal more and more frequently with massive music library corporations, who can 'represent' tens of thousands of tracks. The task of \"filling out\" the music for a show becomes a one-stop shopping kind of event—a single phone call from a line producer to a music library sales rep (though they typically give themselves a more high-flung title, that's really what they are) can make it happen.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo if you want to compete in the music library biz under your own banner (i.e., not writing for an existing library company or composer), the bare minimum number of cues you'd better have ready to go is 500. Fewer than that, and no one (producers \u003ci\u003eor\u003c/i\u003e music library execs) will consider you worth the trouble of doing the paperwork. Even better is 1,000 cues. At 1,000 cues, across a wide variety of styles and emotions, you could conceivably go directly to a reality show or production company and promote your own library. Your mileage may vary, but in my experience that's where it seems to be shaking out these days.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf you don't have that many cues just lying around (!), one option is to get into business with an existing outfit. There are many of them out there, and (like music supervisors, above) they've pretty much sewed up the market for this type of gig. You'll be one or two steps removed from actually meeting filmmakers or seeing picture… and you'll be giving up a sizeable portion of the income on the cues you create… and the pay up front is small, if any… but you will be writing music that actually stands a chance of getting placed in a show. You'll be aligning yourself with a company that already has established contacts, in a business where contacts are the coin of the realm. It may sound like I'm slamming the notion, but I'm really not—you just have to have a plan for moving beyond this stage of your career, if moving beyond it is what you want to do (for many people it isn't!). Otherwise that old chestnut about a career opportunity turning into a career trap could be the story of your life. Proceed with caution.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e4. The Temp Track.\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHere's one where you can actually gain ground, if you're willing to admit that there's no rule prohibiting composers from befriending music editors and sneaking their own scores into the temp. It's actually the rule rather than the exception… and another reason why LA-based composers have a colossal edge. Befriending music editors brings cool people into your social circle. It makes interesting work-conversations more likely. And it makes it possible for your music to become the 'default position' early in the show's post-production process. Let some other composer fall prey to an unexpected competitor… you!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAt a bare minimum you can ask your music editor friend what's being temped into a project they're working on. Then you can demo in a style that is similar. Or, if you're convinced the approach is wrong, you can work against the grain and submit something completely different, armed with the knowledge that what you're sending will be a fresh approach. (crazy as this may sound, I heard of a situation very much like this only a couple of weeks ago. Of a dozen short-list composers who sent in demos, the one who went completely against the brief from the filmmakers landed the gig. But you have to be damned sure you're right to try this!)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf you're not \"on the temp,\" and you haven't the first clue what scores the music editor is using, you will find it much harder to write music that's in the ballpark of what the filmmakers and execs are expecting to hear. You're writing in the dark, using your psychic abilities to divine the intent of the production. That's a tough proposition.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e5. The Producer's Girlfriend's Cousin's College Roommate.\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUnlike the temp track, here you basically have no wiggle room. You get blown out because of a pre-existing relationship (however tenuous or unmerited) that someone leverages to get on a show. The only thing I'd mention here is that sometimes the composer at the other end of this ridiculous broken-line connection is actually good. And you have to admire the networking skill required to pull off something like this. Don't hate the game… don't even hate the player. As with the temp track, the secret here is: don't assume a rule exists just because a tactic is personally distasteful to you.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e6. The Old Flame.\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNo, I'm not talking (exclusively) about ex-romantic partners. I'm thinking more about a situation like Burton and Elfman, reuniting after Howard Shore stepped in for Ed Wood. Or Cameron and Horner. Or any number of other teams that break up and come back together… sometimes precisely at the moment you think you're a lock for the gig! Ouch. It's a tough one to take (believe me—I've experienced it), and yet there's something to be said for loyalty. Even if that loyalty is sporadic.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere's not much else to say here… if you get edged out by an Old Flame, there's little to be done. My advice: wish them the best, then silently hope for another breakup (and your opportunity to introduce the filmmaker to the joys of a lower-drama creative relationship).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOne thing I'm noticing about all these unexpected competitors is that there's a social aspect to nearly all of them. Which underlines the social-interaction portion of our job even more clearly. I'll end by making it simple: Being a competent writer is crucial. Being a brilliant writer helps. But\u0026nbsp;the better you are at the social aspect of the game, the more success you'll meet with in your career.\u0026nbsp;Whichever of the two you are.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e___________________\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cdiv class\u003d\"separator\" style\u003d\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/S3uZkry-saI/AAAAAAAAARw/kT-rOy93hfs/s1600-h/sig-sanders.png\" imageanchor\u003d\"1\" style\u003d\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"\u003e\u003cimg border\u003d\"0\" src\u003d\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/S3uZkry-saI/AAAAAAAAARw/kT-rOy93hfs/s1600/sig-sanders.png\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-size: x-small;\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eLEE SANDERS\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-size: x-small;\"\u003ehas scored hundreds of episodes of network television, including music for seven-time Emmy award-winner THE AMAZING RACE, THE BACHELOR, PROJECT RUNWAY, and numerous others.

How do you reconcile that with this career?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca name\u003d'more'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eFirst off, I'm guessing most of you are comfortable taking chances. This career comes with high risk and \u003ci\u003ezero\u003c/i\u003e promise of reward. So the fact that you're interested in composing at all is a pretty reliable sign that you're aware of the gamble. People who are risk-takers generally enjoy tough competition, as well. Generally… but not always.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eRisk and competition are different. Competition implies effort. A lottery ticket is a risk, not a competition—there's nothing you can do, besides buying more tickets, to improve your chances of hitting the right combination of numbers. Whereas, if you fail to land a gig, there's always a nagging guilt, or doubt, that remains: What could I be doing better? Why didn't they like me? Why do I have to do this 'schmoozing and hustling' part—why can't writing incredible be enough?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eToday's column is all about these \u003ci\u003einner-game \u003c/i\u003easpects of the career. It's all about improving what's between our ears, rather than what's coming out of our speakers. It's a subject I want to tackle even more here on SCOREcast, if you're interested. So let me know.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFor now, here's an orientation: some basic techniques for getting through the competitive aspects of the biz, even (especially) if you find them distasteful.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFirst, \u003cb\u003ediscipline\u003c/b\u003e yourself to a positive attitude. Being dejected and cynical is easy. Finding reasons to stay in the game, and to keep a smile on your face as you do it, is much tougher. It is, in fact, a job unto itself. It requires discipline—one of the great unsung commodities of the age we're in. I think discipline is a finite quantity, with each of us possessing a certain intrinsic maximum capacity that is expressed to a greater or lesser extent depending on how we prioritize its usage and constant development. Just like building muscle at the gym, in other words.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt's only a theory, but it seems to line up with my experience, and I definitely feel the burn when I've had to force a little more discipline onto \u003ci\u003emyself\u003c/i\u003e from time to time (usually around deadlines!).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSecond, \u003cb\u003eexpose\u003c/b\u003e yourself to competitive experiences more frequently… and not just in film music. Desensitize yourself through increased exposure, a little at a time. So that un-returned phone call didn't make you feel so great? Make ten more… twenty more. Once you realize that any one failure, any one defeat, isn't the end of the road, you should (should!) be able to breathe a little easier next time.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThird, \u003cb\u003estudy\u003c/b\u003e resources that are proven for other competitive environments. There are books, websites, DVDs that use the same fundamental mental-toughness techniques that top trainers preach day in and day out to the peak-performers in every human endeavor. This technology has actually been developed to a fairly astonishing level—take advantage, be skeptical as required when confronted with some of the ridiculous claims that are out there, and find what works for you. Make a proactive effort to improve, just like you do when you sit down to compose. Work at it.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFinally, \u003cb\u003eunclench\u003c/b\u003e. Accept that there may, in fact, be aspects of this career that aren't your favorite thing in the world. Put in perspective, though, they're actually relatively minor when you compare them to the fact that, even at a middling level of success, millions of people around the world will be hearing the music you create. You're taking your place as one of the people who shapes the artistic reality of the present moment. That's a pretty spectacular reward, and it's one you shouldn't just blow past in some sort of rush to whine about having to get out there and hustle.\u003cdiv class\u003d\"blogger-post-footer\"\u003e\u003cimg width\u003d'1' height\u003d'1' src\u003d'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2957472132698657339-2305918263867029981?l\u003dwww.scorecastonline.com' alt\u003d'' /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"},"link":[{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2957472132698657339/posts/default/2305918263867029981"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2957472132698657339/posts/default/2305918263867029981"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"../../../../../2010/02/weekend-provocation-shrinking-violet.html","title":"Weekend Provocation: Shrinking Violet Edition"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Lee Sanders"},"uri":{"$t":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/08035088236361437862"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$extendedProperty":{"xmlns$gd":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005","name":"OpenSocialUserId","value":"15436834845629676295"}}],"media$thumbnail":{"xmlns$media":"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/","url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hCspY__CLOo/S2jpvrhCDoI/AAAAAAAAAJU/cqGiIbebaZo/s72-c/sanders-provocation-1.png","height":"72","width":"72"}}]}});
