		<description><![CDATA[Great article. 

I used to compose in a very haphazard way (sometimes just starting with the timbre of an instrument for inspiration) but recently I developed a new approach which usually works well. Firstly, I compose the piece at the piano until I am happy with it as a composition. I then take the final piano midi file and orchestrate it using my VST plugins. This is the fun part as its like adding colour to your black and white drawing. At this point I can still add or take away certain elements e.g. change parts of the melody or harmony etc. As you get to know the piece better these few tweaks can add the icing on the cake (or ruin it if you&#039;re not careful). It&#039;s at this point that the orchestral sounds come into their own and can guide the direction of the composition. 

Overall, I like working like this because it is more disciplined approach and more enjoyable. First, you create the composition, without the distraction of the orchestration (although you may be building up a rough idea of certain instruments in your mind) and then the &quot;treat&quot; is to hear the music develop with all the various new timbres, while having the confidence that as a piece of music, it also works. You still have to tread carefully at the orchestration stage though, because a poor arrangement can ruin the piece. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ryan, I totally agree with the idea of looking to more concrete art forms for guidance in the &#039;How&#039; of composing. I think you can also learn a lot as a composer from stand-up comedy and acting when it comes to relating to your audience. 

The problem I have yet to overcome when using similar techniques as the value studies is the subject of instrumentation. And I guess this also goes for even for initial sketches. It&#039;s logical to a degree to start with &quot;broad strokes&quot; - basic melodies and harmonic movement etc. However leaving the instrumentation, specifically the choosing of which instrument plays what, (orchestration might be a better phrase!), to latter stage in the composition process can completely change your composition.

 I remember a listing to a composer professor talk about the importance of knowing the instrument 1st before you start composing. As choice shouldn&#039;t just be a &#039;black and white&#039; decision of timbre or even instrument range and the musicians ability if performed live. There&#039;s something more - or at least I believe there is. And I also believe that it can sometimes separate &#039;the men from the boys&#039;, when you here a composition that would have sounded great on the piano but just doesn&#039;t translate well to the wind instruments.

Using different paints in composition tends to also mean using different brush heads. What do you think?

		<description><![CDATA[Absolutely! I also find it much easier to work out the rough building blocks, step away from it, and then come back with a fresh perspective to fill in the details. For some reason coming back to it with fresh ears makes it so much easier to finish effectively.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Woo Fellow South Australian :)! Great article. I have been using a technique similar to this for a few songs now. I find that getting the structure down and keeping to basics goes a long way. Getting bogged down in detail too early can kills a song for me]]></description>
