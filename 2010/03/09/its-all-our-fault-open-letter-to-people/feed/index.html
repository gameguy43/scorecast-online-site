		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for that - - I&#039;d have to say the &quot;street dancing&quot; over underscores came across as a pretty eye-rolling bad idea. Although - - and I really don&#039;t know Marc Shaiman (wish I did) but have met him, attended a function where he was feted - - but I can just imagine him coming up with that idea, and falling out laughing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With respect to him, and I don&#039;t know whether this was his idea, but if it was intended as comedy I&#039;m not sure whether it flew or flopped. Yes, actually, I am sure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t know that something like this was going on, but all I can say is that when Mr. Giacchino said &quot;never listen to those who say it&#039;s a waste of time&quot;, I was moved to tears. I found my self raising my fist in the air and shouting &quot;THANK YOU!&quot;. He was right for the most part that there are actually people who does not have the same support system to follow ones dreams. And I am one those people. So, I would like to thank Mr. Giacchino who inspires and reaches out to people no matter where they are from!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ok. My opinion is: It&#039;s not that now we all saying &quot;yeahh  Great Giacchinno&quot; just due to the post.  We need to run with our head, looking for realty. No way, If you want to go for the business you have to follow the rule of the system. No Way. The rest is a shy compromise on our consciousness. &lt;br&gt;We need to be helmsmen, following vibrations. We need to know that we are marketing as well. We just can try to change it, but we need a good position to achieve. No way. Otherwise get a friend score.&lt;br&gt;I&#039;m sorry, we cannot leave the rule of the marketing. Just doing our best in the music. And the proble still remain because if all people liked lady gaga more than Hans Zimmer.. Is lady gaga better? mhh.. is the marketing populism the only truth? So.. Don&#039;t care and go for what you feel, managing youself awarw we are in the business. There is not an alternative way cnsidering the human being. We cannot go for the gigs and marketing and be cool, deep and saint at the same time.&lt;br&gt;Fuck our hyporisy. We need to watch it through the eyes and live with its consciousness. Once we got it fully we can plan to makke some else better but it will be impossibile. So, there is no way. Or black or white. The gray is a compromise (talkking about business/commercial). What we like are only little art with the compromise of the marketing. So keep it in mind. Or go to play around the world with no money.  It&#039;s a dilemma to find the comprmise because it does not exist, so what we can do? I DONT FUKIN KNOW!!!!!!  WE CANNOT DO ANYTHING IF WE WANT TO GO FOR THE OSCAR WE CAN JUST TRY TO PUT SOME OF OUR TRICKS TO WASH OUR CONCIUSNESS. FUCK! I M FUCKING SAD&lt;br&gt;BYE]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I loved Giacchino&#039;s score!  It&#039;s original, it&#039;s fresh!  The other guys are great composers too.  I like them, especially Desplat.   I for one didn&#039;t hear anything &#039;distinct&#039; in Zimmer&#039;s or Horners scores, nothing I could really grab on to.  In Giacchino&#039;s that was there.  Thanks for listening!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[PPpphhht... this blog post is so, like, whatever.  It&#039;s a total rip-off of another post by Gustav Holst.  Yea, so it got like, 24 comments, but whatever... anyone who likes Ogden&#039;s posts and comments doesn&#039;t know anything about blogging or commenting.  So he and he Scorecast &#039;team&#039; (I think Sanders actually writes all his posts for him anyways) have worked really hard to build a great community and people love it, but I think it&#039;s totally lame and if I had the time I would totally make a website that would be like, a million times more awesome.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting article as always. Going back to the point of slagging off big-name composers: it always sounds to me like soccer fans criticising big-name players; what the hell does anyone on the blogs know about what&#039; it takes to be a professional soccer player ? As Deane correctly points out, the same goes for composers. I make a very good living from my music here in France so sure, I&#039;ve got an opinion - I think Hans&#039; score to Sherlock Holmes was simply brilliant.  Don&#039;t really know Giaccino&#039;s work, still less the man, but he got the nomination and the award - big up to him.]]></description>

They have all written great music and some less great but isn&#039;t it about providing the material what it needs ?&lt;br&gt;Our budgets have shrunken because the films have changed, The ability to create an entire picture in a room ? and because they&#039;re are sooo many freakin&#039; composers now. I&#039;m for support and positivity.&lt;br&gt;I think we all wish for another epic and broad score but the film community has changed so much.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Respect, Deane B-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;[...]negative accusations and heated and highly-charged opinions about the alleged detriment of Hans Zimmer&#039;s influence in the community, as well as allegations of him being someone who doesn&#039;t do what he proclaims he does&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I haven&#039;t read or experienced a single Zimmer discussion that didn&#039;t turn into a Zimmer bashing battle, anywhere, be it online or in real life. Personally, I do feel it&#039;s absolutely a pity that &quot;everybody&quot; is looking for (project makers) and trying to copy (composers) that Zimmer sound. Ok, not everybody, but you know what I mean. And ok, many composers only try to copy the sound because that&#039;s what being asked from them. &lt;br&gt;Pity as it is, I love the man&#039;s work, and I can totally understand WHY his music is so popular, even with people who aren&#039;t into film music. I totally understand WHY &quot;everybody&quot; wants that sound in their productions. But as much as I&#039;m a fan of Zimmer, I&#039;m also a big fan of diversity. I wouldn&#039;t want to eat pancakes every single day either. I&#039;d get bored of it very easily. And fat.&lt;br&gt;So yeah, love the man&#039;s work, but I do feel it&#039;s a real pity &quot;everybody&quot; is looking for the Zimmer sound. &lt;br&gt;Heck, Hans Zimmer feels it&#039;s a real pity &quot;everybody&quot; is looking for the Zimmer sound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Out of all five nominations, I&#039;ve only heard Giacchino&#039;s, Zimmer&#039;s, and Horner&#039;s. I thought Avatar wasn&#039;t horrible, but hardly refreshing or inspired (which happens to be exactly how I feel about the movie itself -- the oscars Avater won are exactly the ones I thought it deserved). I like some stuff Horner has done (mostly his older work), but frankly his four-note &quot;danger&quot; motive irritates the hell out of me in every single of his movies. It takes me out of the movie experience every time. I&#039;ve never gotten what the hell&#039;s up with that? If it were up to me: no oscar for Horner until he stops doing that!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Refreshing&quot;, now that&#039;s a word that definitely applies to Zimmer&#039;s Sherlock Holmes. I love that score, and I really appreciate the &quot;rawness&quot; in it, which is something I personally favor and try to bring in my own music as well. Refreshing? Definitely. Oscar-worthy? Well, maybe not -- whatever &quot;oscar-worthy&quot; is supposed to mean anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Out of those three scores, I think Up definitely deserved it. &lt;br&gt;Heck, Hans Zimmer said Giacchino definitively deserved it -- even before he had won it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides, Zimmer and Horner already got one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Never met Giacchino, but -- just like Zimmer and Beltrami, for that matter -- he does come across like a very nice guy in every bit of footage I&#039;ve seen of the man. And this guy knows how to write music that works and sticks. I&#039;d love to hear the arguments against his oscar, actually.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Deanne, I think you captured the heavy load all composers in this business suffer from. It is the idea of loathing each other and rather than congratulating one another on achievements of merit they berate one another. This town is full of petty people. I think the distinction that people who are composers have is that they fall into two categories. The categories are those who can compose and orchestrate without the help of equipment or others and those that cannot. That does not mean one is superior to the other but in this day and age the rise of the composer who cannot do either seems to be the norm of the day and is evident by their busy schedules . Each brings a special gift to the table. There has to be a happy medium where all is respected and not until that time will everyone unite for the greater good of all. As a group we need to shed preconceived notions and be open to the present and realize that the past prior to technology is the past and we need to co-exist with technology and those who function within it in the present and future.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike Giacchino took the time to talk with me wholeheartedly and enthusiastically about music (ok, about his cue) once. He was a delightful and mellow guy.  I had another opportunity to conduct on of his cues for Lost as part of a joint USC/UCLA class...another awesome experience, but less important to the first in terms of him taking the time to talk with a random member of a film scoring class about the joy of writing music.  His music is tremendous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hans Zimmer is great too.  Yeah, sometimes his music is not to my taste, but I have deep respect for what he has done as a composer and a team builder.  Actually, I was rooting for his score for Sherlock Holmes for this round.  In any case...winners for the Oscars don&#039;t matter to me as much as nominees in general and the thrill of seeing great people pour their hearts into their work.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wonder if we need to bring back the &quot;competition&quot; theme again, because snark amongst the pros, and the amateurs, is just gross.  I&#039;ve experienced it a few times myself where other composers flat out ignored me, and they were pretty much on the same achievement level as me.  That&#039;s lame.  We are all bound together by a common love for writing music; some of us get to work together on a project, which I personally think would be tremendous, and if not, we can be collegial.  ...and if we don&#039;t like someone&#039;s music we can at least be polite and professional.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have a feeling that some people feel the need to be more cut-throat as resources diminish in the film world, in order to get ahead.  That simply isn&#039;t true.  This is a business built via friendship and respect.  I&#039;m not talking about unions or CAA or contracts or studio decisions, sure, but the connection between director, editor, cinematographer, actors, composer(s), and all the other production and post-production (and some key pre-production) folks had better be meaningful or else it just ain&#039;t worth it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is the third time someone has used the term &quot;backlash&quot;, and I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d go as far as to say that this is that. I would characterize more of what I witnessed as the kind of talk that you would hear at your second grader&#039;s recess playground. I alluded to some of them in my opening statements:

&quot;The Academy made a mistake&quot;. &quot;He doesn&#039;t deserve it&quot;. &quot;UP sucked and it wasn&#039;t the best score of the year.&quot; &quot;It was a rip-off of traditional French music.&quot;

Some of these opinions *are* subjective, I agree... and therefore interesting to hear inasmuch as they are relevant. But other parts of them are nothing more than epithets that are uninformed, unfounded and rooted in childish meanness or jealousies left unaddressed. For example, I think we can all agree that while some people&#039;s tastes would have led them to vote for &quot;SHERLOCK HOLMES&quot;, &quot;UP!&quot; certainly does *not* &quot;suck&quot;. Neither do the rest of the nominees, for that matter. They were all deserving.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[MG is a brilliant composer from his video game work, Lost, Ratatouille he has so much depth and he&#039;s the nicest guy. I haven&#039;t heard the scores or seen the movies from the other entries but UP I did see and it was certainly Oscar worthy (I would not say the same about the JH&#039;s Avatar which I did hear and honestly felt it was forgettable). 

Too many composer feel that the success and accolades of their peers comes at the expense of their own. Aren&#039;t we all just trying to make a decent living doing what we love? Competition should push us to excel not to attack one another out of envy and jealousy. After all it does benefit us all (I am a composer too) since it does reinforce the strength of having a great score in film and likely wins a few more directors on big and small projects to want an original well crafted score as opposed to licensed music or music library tracks.

		<description><![CDATA[Well said Deane. How or why would anyone discredit Michael Giacchino is beyond me.

&quot;Up&quot; was brilliant. &quot;The Incredibles&quot; was incredible (I think that score should have won an Oscar too!)

And, if you haven&#039;t seen it yet, the 5 min short he scored &quot;One Man Band&quot; continues to blow my mind...

As Deane hinted, his class was obvious in his acceptance speech:

“...When I was nine I asked my dad, “Can I have your movie camera? That old, wind-up 8mm camera that was in your drawer?” And he goes, “Sure, take it.” And I took it and I started making movies with it and I started being as creative as I could, and never once in my life did my parents ever say, “What you’re doing is a waste of time.” Never. And I grew up, I had teachers, I had colleagues, I had people that I worked with all through my life who always told me what you’re doing is not a waste of time. So it was normal to me that it was OK to do that. But  I know there are kids out there that don’t have that support system, so if you’re out there and you’re listening, listen to me: If you want to be creative, get out there and do it. It’s not a waste of time. Do it. OK?”

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not a working composer, but I agree with everything you&#039;ve said here.

I expected &quot;Up&quot; to win for best original score, because like Brian said below, I&#039;d never seen so much hype about a score in a long while.  The music of Up got a lot of people who usually don&#039;t talk about film music, talking about film music.  I really don&#039;t have a problem with it.  Why should I?  It was a great score.

I&#039;m also really surprised to hear that there was/is such a backlash against Giacchino.  I don&#039;t get it either.  I&#039;ve had the pleasure of meeting him briefly, and he seemed like a genuinely nice guy; I haven&#039;t seen any indications that this would be otherwise.  I&#039;ve also met Hans Zimmer; I could say the same thing about him.  Sure I haven&#039;t worked with them, but it always surprises me to hear anyone write badly about another composer, or person, when it&#039;s doubtful they&#039;d be in the position to do so.  Besides, what about principles and respect?  Yes, I think people can have differing opinions, and still be respectful.

I&#039;m more of a filmmaker, and when I watch films, I have strong opinions about how they were written, made, shot all the time.  I can see why composers would look at music the same way.  So there&#039;s an element of this that I understand.  However, if I think that something is &quot;bad&quot;, I always try to figure out how it could be better; otherwise, the criticism is meaningless.  It&#039;s easy to criticize, but more difficult to improve.  At the same time, I&#039;m in college, and I&#039;m not yet working with the people whose work I critique yet.  When I am, I&#039;m not going to be burning any bridges.

&quot;Composers and their teams have to start supporting each other and learning how to be positive and encouraging, rather than negative and destructive towards one another&quot; - Like I said, I&#039;m not a working composer yet, but I&#039;ll second that sentiment, and do what I can to help the community.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very well said Deane, I agree whole-heartedly. A couple of years ago, when I decided to get into the business, I came in with all sorts of notions. I was tired of the music that was coming out of people like Horner and Zimmer. Then I learned to be humble (thanks to a fellow composer and mentor) and accept the fact that these people are really talented and can compose a cue a hell of a lot better than I can as a 24 year-old newbie.

I think we should all be glad that there are 4 categories related to music and sound in the oscars that are shown on the main night (I&#039;m not sure if there are other awards on a separate night). That is a sign that music and sound are still considered crucial elements to any film and that there is recognition of brilliant execution of said categories.

Let&#039;s fight the good fight and not each other.]]></description>

I was tired of the music that was coming out of people like Horner and Zimmer. Then I learned to be humble (thanks to a fellow composer and mentor) and accept the fact that these people are really talented and can compose a cue a hell of a lot better than I can as a 24 year-old newbie.</p>
<p>I think we should all be glad that there are 4 categories related to music and sound in the oscars that are shown on the main night (I&#8217;m not sure if there are other awards on a separate night). That is a sign that music and sound are still considered crucial elements to any film and that there is recognition of brilliant execution of said categories.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s fight the good fight and not each other.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Well Said, Deane! I used to work with one if the nominees and he is demanding, but then again he has an insane schedule. He gets quite a bit of criticism in this industry for his methods, but he is a true champion of nurturing new talent and an amazing artist to boot!!

The composers he has brought into this is industry are some of the busiest composers out there and have changed the landscape forever. Some of us may not like all of the composers nominated, but at least respect them. They are there for a reason, it&#039;s not a fluke, that they are where they are. As far as the industry and where it is heading. We have to change quite a bit, we are &quot;Are own worst enemy&quot;, so to speak.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[FINALLY - some common sense! Thank you so much Deane for calling out the so-called &quot;professional&quot; composers I see on twitter slamming other composers every time Oscar season rolls around. It&#039;s sickening.

And thank you for writing another fabulous post that brings the focus toward action and behavior and not just &quot;talk.&quot; You&#039;re words here are incredibly inspiring and I can only hope that this article gets passed around a great deal since so many people need to read it. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, I was completely oblivious to ANY backlash over MG&#039;s win the other night. I guess anything is possible. I just didn&#039;t have the faith that Hollywood would get it right. I was wrong.

I could go on and on about this but I&#039;ll just say one thing...I can&#039;t recall the last time I saw a film where all the subsequent reviews of the film itself (positive or negative) lauded the music as much as UP. People just don&#039;t talk that much about music in their film reviews.

MG has only been in the Hollywood scoring business for six years and it&#039;s actually a shame this is only his first Oscar.
