		<description><![CDATA[Let me give everyone here a big tip.
Don&#039;t use loops or pads. Don&#039;t use pre-made string runs or a &#034;full&#034; orchestra patch. Write your own music, note for note. Otherwise, you won&#039;t grow and your music will sound bland and generic. You are writing freaking orchestral music, not some two bit rock track. 

Using pre-made loops and full ensemble patches is everything that&#039;s wrong with writing today. I don&#039;t quite understand how people can actually present a piece stating they wrote it, when in fact they did not. If sections are not written by you, but just placed inside the project, you should be ashamed of yourself. 

If someone says, make this score into sheet music, and you are not able to, you need to do some self revaluation. 

Learn to do what the hell you say you do. You write orchestral music? Then do it, and don&#039;t rely on cheap tools to make you look better.

Now, I understand that some may say &#034;we don&#039;t have time in such a tight deadline.&#034; To be frank, 99% of the time that&#039;s total BS, and just denial that helps you sleep at night. If you are working on an actual television show, and need to produce 20 minutes of music a week, then I can start to see why. But if you learn how to orchestrate properly (as no one does these days), writing strings runs and brass textures should take a couple minutes. It would be more original and fit the piece more adequately if you write them yourself.

Once again. If you want to call yourself an orchestral composer, be one. You all know who you are.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great truth Jeff. I definitely agree with you. Probably is just because it&#039;s been 8 years since I&#039;ve been studying in a Conservatory of music that I really understand the importance of the harmony, and the study of the masterpieces of the past; and if one can put in his compositions all the knowledge he got from these great teachers, then he&#039;ll be above the 80% of the other composers.. I&#039;d like to ask you one thing Jeff: recently I&#039;ve found out that many famous current film composers have an orchestrator.. well i&#039;ve to say that my admiration for them now justÂ extinguished. Don&#039;t you think that a great composer should be a great orchestrator too? I mean.. is not just too easy to write smth with piano or a few instruments,get all the glory for it while Â someone else did all the hard work behind it?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, good point, Diederik--sometimes you can get too immersed in finding the &quot;perfect&quot; sound and suddenly the inspiration is gone. That&#039;s why I always get ideas down as quickly as possible--scribbled on a notepad, as a voice recording on my iPhone, or quickly played into my Zoom recorder. Likewise, while scoring it often helps to stay focused on the music for as long as you&#039;re inspired instead of getting sidetracked by choosing snare drum sounds and sorting through reverb presets (as I sometimes do!).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jeff! I&#039;m glad you wrote what you did in your conclusion about the fact that someÂ piecesÂ are actually so reliant on the &quot;sonics&quot; that you do need to hear them (or at least imagine them) when you are writing.


The reason it struck a chord with me today of all days is because I&#039;m currently in the middle of scoring my first low budget horror film. Now, while the film does have it&#039;s moments where the music is thematic/harmonic and the general advice you give would definitely be the right way to approach it. In fact what I tend to do is have a piano part deliberately in my orchestral template in Sibelius exactly so I can work up the entire thematic outline there before transferring to the other staves.

It&#039;s true that I do find myself writing a lot of &quot;tension&quot; music as well though (in fact I am right at this minute). As might be expected these tension scenes tend to rely a fair amount on strange orchestral/percussive effects as well as other sound effects and it&#039;s certainly a massive help to me if I can hear those while I&#039;m writing/shaping the cue.

Both approaches have their Place I feel, but I agree that it certainly doesn&#039;t do any harm to step away from the technology once in a while andÂ remindÂ ourselves what composing is really all about. :)]]></description>
