<p>SCOREcast ushered in a new decade of worldwide community goodness this past January as we celebrated our 10th Anniversary with 130 of LA&#8217;s finest SCOREcasters, as well as some friends and family from around the globe, at our annual dinner in Los Angeles. All of this happened in the midst of Deane and Brian&#8217;s 15th trip to the NAMM Convention, and the boys use this episode to talk about the highlights from this year&#8217;s show. They also cover the controversy surrounding the recent Academy Awards telecast, as well as an exciting new opportunity for composers and filmmakers happening this month in Los Angeles through something called the &#8220;Helix Collective&#8221;.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Many might argue that Hollywood is more concerned these days about having "hit films" than it is about creating successful ones. What's the difference?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p>What kind of &#8220;professional&#8221; walks out on a film set to start production in less than two weeks?James Franco does, that&#8217;s who. That&#8217;s right. After already spending half a million on pre-production just weeks away from shooting, James Franco pulled out of GARDEN OF LAST DAYS, a film he was directing and starring in. The reason? According to Mike Flemming at <em>Deadline Hollywood:</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Franco’s exit had to do with a disagreement with financier Millennium over the crew he wanted to hire. Basically, Franco put together a crew that didn’t &#8220;have the experience&#8221; to get approval from the bond company. Millennium wouldn’t approve his choices.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p>There are a couple different ways to interpret what happened. I realize we are armchair quarterbacking this and not privy to exactly what happened. But think about it with me for a moment. One possible scenario is that Millennium just did not want to do the project any more out of their fear it would lose money and they quietly, under the table, told the bond company to not approve the crew. This would allow them to save the relationship with their star Franco and blame the film not happening on the faceless bond company. That is a possibility. Also&#8230;I am told the bond company does not really care if the film is good&#8230;just if the film can be done on the budget laid out. It is possible the $3M budgeted was certain to go way over budget and the crew assembled did not have the experience to navigate a tight budget. They most likely met with everyone they would have been concerned about&#8230; and discovered the way they are wanting to shoot, there would be no way they were going to only spend $3M. The bond company estimation could have been much higher to finish the film Franco wanted to make and so determined his crew didn&#8217;t know how to be efficient with their choices. That is also possible for sure. But part of me thinks something else may be going on.</p>
<p>James Franco is a rather talented guy who has shown his talent both in front of and behind the camera. He also is someone in this industry who I would consider to be a true &#8220;artist&#8221;. I have always felt he is creating art when he works. He takes chances. He works on both indies and Blockbusters. He breaks barriers. And he has also finally earned the respect of many in Hollywood as an &#8220;A-list&#8221; actor. There is little doubt he knows what he is doing when it comes to making a successful film. So why would a studio/bond company trust him enough to hire him as a director, but not trust his choices for his crew?</p>
<p>I was speaking with a director/producer friend of mine.  He is an active AMPAS member, respected by his peers, and use to be a studio executive in addition to his producing work. So he has been on both sides of the process of making and releasing a film. He knows what he is talking about. He shared with me a profound concept that explains how to interpret what is going on in Hollywood here. And he learned it from Hal Prince, an American theatrical producer and director who has worked on many of the best-known Broadway musical productions of the past 50 years. Hal has garnered twenty-one Tony Awards, more than any other individual, including eight for directing, eight for producing the year&#8217;s Best Musical, two as Best Producer of a Musical and three special awards. Cabaret, West Side Story, Cats, Evite, Phantom Of The Opera. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Hal said there is a difference between a &#8220;Hit&#8221; &amp; a &#8220;Flop&#8221; and a &#8220;Success&#8221; &amp; a &#8220;Failure.&#8221; One set of terms has to do with money&#8230;the other does not.</p>
<p>A <em><strong>hit</strong></em> makes money. Lots of money.<br />
A <em><strong>flop</strong></em> does not.</p>
<p>A <em><strong>success</strong></em> is not tied to money but whether if it is successful in what it set out to do. (Tell a compelling story, entertain, etc&#8230;)<br />
A <em><strong>failure</strong></em> is unsuccessful in completing its goals.</p>
<p>How does this apply to Hollywood today? Many might argue that Hollywood is more concerned these days about having &#8220;hit films&#8221; than it is about creating film successes. A hit does not necessarily have to be a successful film. In fact, I would argue many hits today are not very successful films. How many times have you gone to see the latest blockbuster film and left the theater saying to yourself, &#8220;that was just not a good film.&#8221; And yet it made millions at the box office opening weekend. It was a hit. But as a film&#8230;it was a failure. Disney&#8217;s <em>John Carter</em> is a recent example many considered to be in the flop category. They did take a $200M write down on the film after all and Rich Ross resigned from his position at Disney over it.</p>
<p>On the contrary, there are many films that were extremely successful, but flops at the box office. Going back a bit into the 90&#8217;s, <em>Pleasantville</em> completely changed how the industry worked in Post-Production. A change still in effect today.  It was the first film to use a Digital Intermediate throughout the entire Post process for its groundbreaking color effects. Previous to this, the digital intermediate was used sparingly for FX shots only. Most people I know love the film and all of those associated with the film are very well-respected in Hollywood for their work on that film. It was truly a success in everything it set out to do and changed Hollywood for the better. But financially at the box office it was actually a flop.</p>
<h2>A New Paradigm</h2>
<p>We have to recognize that the financiers and studios today are much more interested in hits than successes. Despite his proven track record of success in film, Franco still could not get his chosen crew to get approved on this little $3 million dollar indie film. This is not hundreds of millions of dollars we are talking about here, but a very low budgeted $3M indie. And Millennium Films, according Deadline Hollywood, would apparently not approve his flop of a crew. Reading between the lines, I keep coming back to the thought that just because some on the crew had not made a $100M dollar hit film, does that necessarily mean they don&#8217;t know what they are doing on a $3M indie film? No. It doesn&#8217;t. The next Tariq Anwar (Editor &#8211; <em>The King&#8217;s Speech, American Beauty</em>), Freddie Young (Cinematographer &#8211; <em>Lawrence Of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago</em>) or Jerry Goldsmith could be among that young crew.</p>
<p>I continue to speculate here, but does anyone really think James Franco would be putting a crew together for a film he was reportedly passionate about that could not pull off what he wanted to do with this little indie? I don&#8217;t. I think the true artist in James was putting together the exact crew perfect to make THAT film&#8230;and yet because some of them were not on the Millennium short list of dept. heads in town, the financiers and bond company (who are experts at the numbers game and not artists and filmmakers) got nervous and began to butt heads with Franco. They did not trust him and his directing choices and probably lost interest in the project and were concerned it would be a flop.  Whether Millennium put the bond company up to not approving the project or not, we will never know. But Franco, out of true loyalty to his film&#8217;s vision and his chosen crew that he believed in, simply walked away. Proving to those around him that there is more to this business than making a hit.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong: The hits <em>are</em> important. They help the studio&#8217;s fund other productions. They <em>must</em> have hits. But if Hollywood is going to start making successful original films again, the films that will become iconic and remembered for generations to come, it is going to have to stop putting a &#8220;hit requirement&#8221; on everything it produces and take more chances across the board on both original stories and young, talented people. Especially the $3M indies like Franco&#8217;s GARDEN OF LAST DAYS and other &#8220;entry-level films&#8221; that are the proving grounds for the future generation of filmmakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&#8230;as composers..how does this apply to us,&#8221; you ask? Well, if you have never had a &#8220;hit&#8221; film&#8230;that does not mean you are not a successful composer. It does not mean you don&#8217;t know what you are doing or talking about. It means the folks out there that may be saying that are confused about the difference between a hit &amp; a flop and a success &amp; a failure. They are not the same. They are exclusive of one another. As a composer, you need to simply focus on making every film score you work on a success and stop worrying about whether it is attached to a hit. Does your music make the film better? Does it do its job well? Did you write a successful score? That is what you should be focusing on.</p>
<p>Hal Prince had it right.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Contemplating moving to Los Angeles for a career in film music? Here are composer Mark Smythe's observations...]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been in Los Angeles since early March 2013 on an Australia Council-funded mentorship program, absorbing all things film music and SoCal: The Good, The Bad and The Bellicose. These are my reflections so far.</p>
<h2>Transit Tantrums</h2>
<p>LA traffic on Thursday afternoon is slower than a George R. R. Martin novel&#8230;and in my case on a shuttle ride, just as gob-smacking when something finally happened. Two young girls in front were chatting excitedly about their impending adventure. Now, they weren&#8217;t exactly shrill but the conversation was audible to all. 40 minutes in, a baby-boomer businessman had an explosive outburst: &#8220;We DON&#8217;T CARE about your banal existence!&#8221;&#8230;stunned silence. A whimpered response. Simmering tension until they were dropped off&#8230;at the same hotel as Mr Explosion and his embarrassed wife. Welcome to Hollywood, girls!</p>
<p>I went to <a href="http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/bmi_participates_in_first_southeast_film_music_symposium" target="_blank">Chattanooga</a> for a weekend, as you do. I had a dawn flight out of LAX so stayed at an airport hotel the night before. Passed the concierge as a man was SCREAMING HIS HEAD OFF at a cab driver for apparently ripping him off all of $9. He kept threatening to call the cops but finally backed down.</p>
<p>On LAX-CHA flight 1, the overhead lockers filled up and a bunch of people had to check their bags through to final destinations, including myself. I didn&#8217;t care; all I needed was my iPad and headphones. Others <em>did care</em> &#8211; airline staff were hammered by well-heeled women with an inflated sense of entitlement, indignant that they wouldn&#8217;t have access to their L&#8217;Oreal travel kits and Xanax.</p>
<p>Then there was the 4-hour delay in Charlotte due to the incoming plane having &#8216;mechanical issues&#8217;. Initially it was 1 hour, then 2&#8230;etc. Was it annoying? Yes. Did it warrant the ageing rocker with a gig that night having an absolute meltdown at the check-in girl, to the point that once again the police were mentioned? NO. I wasn&#8217;t overly happy myself, but would much rather be delayed than fall out of the sky. And for a while there it did feel like the precursor to an episode of &#8216;Air Crash Investigations&#8217;.</p>
<p>SO &#8211; my point is, this was very early into my visit and I was thinking &#8216;holy crap, is this REALLY what Americans are like?&#8217; NO IT ISN&#8217;T. The symposium was FANTASTIC and when I returned to LA, the perpetually warm glow of Angelenos restored my societal faith. I guess travel brings out the best/worst in anyone and I saw some doozies of the latter kind. 99.9% of Americans are nice, genuinely interested in foreigners and usually mean it when they say &#8220;what can I do to help?&#8221;. Embrace that percentile.</p>
<h2>Location/Vehiculation</h2>
<p>Something anyone new to to town should consider carefully, well before landing. Unlike Melbourne, where I could walk 5 minutes to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Fawkner Park or my local cafe strip, LA isn&#8217;t <em>really</em> a city. Rather, it&#8217;s a vast sprawl of mini-cities connected by a web of freeways, each enclave having a unique flavour that may or may not suit your taste. Santa Monica and Venice are renowned for their beach lifestyle and slightly cooler air, but if most of your stuff&#8217;s happening Downtown or in The Valley, you&#8217;ll spend an awful lot of time on the road if you&#8217;re based out west. I knew I&#8217;d be hanging in Studio City/ Hollywood a lot, so took the time to find and pre-book the perfect AirBNB rental, smack in the middle. Slightly pricey but the location definitely saved me time and money. If AirBNB-style pads are beyond your budget, the ubiquitous CRAIGSLIST is a great place to find sub-lets, especially during summer holidays.</p>
<p>Mode of transport is a no-brainer. Unless you have incredibly helpful friends going to Point B (which I actually often do) or don&#8217;t mind spending hours traversing multi Metro routes, <em><strong>you need a car</strong></em>. If you have no choice but to get a cab somewhere, KNOW THIS: They&#8217;ll take at least 20 minutes to turn up, cost a lot and woe betide the passenger that dares to pay by credit card – even if your cab-finder app says it&#8217;s cool. I had a heated argument with a driver about this very point; in the end he was only placated when I tipped cash. If you don&#8217;t want to drive on a night out, a far better option is <a href="http://www.lyft.me" target="_blank">LYFT</a>: a smartphone app that uses your location to find and order a driver in minutes, is 20% cheaper, 100% friendlier and automatically calculates a tip-inclusive fare – ONLY from your credit card. Ok, so they have weird pink moustaches on the cars, but most drivers also stock water and snack treats : )</p>
<h2>LA Flakers — A Few Bad Players or a Team Malaise?</h2>
<p>Much has been said and written about the notoriously slow/complete lack of follow through here in Tinseltown; one friend even suggested that &#8216;yes means maybe, maybe means no and people never say no&#8217;. Hackneyed phrases are quoted with mirth by the cheerfully cynical: “let&#8217;s do lunch” &#8211; ”we&#8217;ll talk” &#8211; etc. Well. I made a conscious decision to ignore the cliché and decide for myself what the deal is. Consequently, I&#8217;ve been very surprised by the reality:</p>
<h3>Those Who&#8217;ve Flaked:</h3>
<p>&#8211; Old Aussie friends now based here, who wanted things from me on a social/industry/material level (they got 2 of the 3) but gave nothing back. Even after I said “You&#8217;re not going to flake on me are you, we will catch up?” I tried to follow up. Twice. We never caught up, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if I suddenly hear from them just before their next gig.<br />
&#8211; Potential new LA friends via Bookface; they were going to &#8216;reach out&#8217; one weekend&#8230;back in March. I tried to follow up. Twice. They de-friended me. Maybe my dry humour was misconstrued when I sent a link to that Four Tops track.</p>
<h3>Those Who Haven&#8217;t Flaked:</h3>
<p>&#8211; New composer friends, including very busy ones working on high-rating shows.<br />
&#8211; Everyone in the industry I&#8217;ve emailed/left a message for, including those I don&#8217;t know that well or haven&#8217;t met yet. I did wait 3 weeks for one reply, but this was a new contact and I time-budgeted accordingly.</p>
<p>So – I&#8217;ve been mildly affected by flakelenos at social level, but industry/music folks have treated me with more than a modicum of politeness and respect. Maybe because I haven&#8217;t burdened myself with unrealistic expectations or exuded the desperate &#8216;I want something from you&#8217; vibe that you can smell a mile away from so many young aspirants. If you come here thinking you&#8217;ll reach the summit straight away, THAT is flakey. Ed Hilary completed his first major climb 13 YEARS before scaling Everest. Patience, persistence and prudence, my friends&#8230;</p>
<h2>Event Etiquette</h2>
<p>Outside of my mentorship with <a href="http://jeffcardoni.com" target="_blank">Jeff Cardoni</a> (CSI:Miami, Wilfred) I&#8217;ve attended a swag (Australian vernacular) of workshops, screenings, seminars and masterclasses. Each event has featured high calibre composers, orchestrators, conductors, directors, or moderators and has been well conceived. Sadly, I can&#8217;t say the same for some of the <em>questions</em> that inevitably slip through the relevance cordon at these things. IT&#8217;S NOT ABOUT YOU! Do you really think that standing up so that everyone can see you when you say &#8220;Hi, my name&#8217;s [wannabe composer X] and I&#8217;ve been working on/done a lot of [gratuitous promo Y] and I work in [DAW Z],&#8221; will make them think <em>&#8220;Wow, I&#8217;m really interested in this guy and what he does, he must write like me because he uses DAW Z&#8221;</em>&#8230;? Truth is, by the time you&#8217;ve got to the actual question, half the room has tuned out (or in my case, head in hands) and the A-lister will remember your face for all the wrong reasons when you push your way through the post-event throng. Then there are those that ask questions just to be &#8216;involved&#8217; and &#8216;seen&#8217;, even if they&#8217;re &#8220;just a songwriter&#8221;&#8230;and you seriously want to punch them when they ask Thomas Newman if he &#8220;scores to picture&#8221;. Or the guy that asked Aaron Zigman if he &#8220;hums ideas in the shower&#8221;. Come on people! Be enthusiastic, but don&#8217;t be a wanker.</p>
<h2>Weeding Out the Tall Poppy</h2>
<p>Australians and New Zealanders are not known for overt self-promotion. In fact, those that say &#8220;I&#8217;m a big deal&#8221; are more often than not regarded as wankers and ostracised by their peers. This is the <strong><em>Tall Poppy Syndrome</em></strong> at work – a &#8216;cut them down&#8217; attitude towards high achievers that is uniquely endemic to Australasia. When I was younger and just out of film music school, I was brimming with enthusiasm; thrilled with any work I could get and any composer I met. Said enthusiasm combined with the mild hero-worship of a composer I spent time with somehow lead to me being perceived as a &#8216;name-dropper&#8217; by a high-ranking person in the Australian film music world. Fast forward four years to the Australian Screen Music Awards, which I was invited to by the organisation this person works for. At an industry lunch prior to the ceremony I made a concerted effort to have a pleasant conversation with this person. But when I told her I was looking forward to the awards, she asked “Are you attending legitimately?”</p>
<p>Happily, my experiences in LA have been the complete opposite. Here, it&#8217;s okay to talk about what you&#8217;ve done, what you&#8217;re doing, who you&#8217;ve connected with and what your aims are. I&#8217;ve been doing so with complete openness and honesty over the last 3 months and have been treated with more respect than I ever was in Australia. In fact, one delightful Executive Director (who holds a comparable position to my antipodean nemesis) now refers to me as her &#8216;favourite Kiwi&#8217;. And you know what? I can write about my awesome night at <a href="http://www.jeffbeal.com" target="_blank">Jeff Beal</a>&#8216;s place without fear of someone telling everybody I&#8217;ve been blowing my own trumpet. I can mention the <a href="http://www.hmmawards.org" target="_blank">Hollywood Music in Media Awards</a> competition I won &#8211; a scoring session with Mr. Beal; helping him record a 25-piece string orchestra. I can say that we exchanged CDs and that he particularly likes my choral stuff.</p>
<p>Los Angeles certainly takes some getting used to, but it&#8217;s so worth it. The top film music people I&#8217;ve met genuinely embrace talent, passion and commitment when they see it.</p>
<p>This, above all, makes me want to stick around.</p>
