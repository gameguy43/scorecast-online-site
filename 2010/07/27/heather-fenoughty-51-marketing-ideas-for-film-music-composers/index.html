<p>We can&#8217;t be quantified or packaged. We&#8217;re artists, darling. Our art speaks for itself. All true&#8230; but all the art out there is vying equally for all of your potential clients&#8217; attentions. And those attention spans are short and very demanding. If you want to make your art into a business, i.e. make money at it, you&#8217;ve no choice &#8211; you have to brand yourself and then market your art. No getting away from it.</p>
<p>And as film composers and sound designers, we&#8217;re usually selling art that&#8217;s <em>yet to be created</em>. So what might be a more effective overall marketing strategy is to think of how we can sell ourselves, our persona, our fun-to-work-with-ness, our attitudes to career and life, how you and I collaborating together will without a doubt create something more awesome than we could possibly have done separately.</p>
<p>So marketing is very important to the film music composer or sound designer. But it need not be boring, time-consuming or expensive. Marketing for us film sound creators can be quick, easy, painless, fun, interesting, and very cheap if you take a little time to think creatively about it. Even if you&#8217;re totally anti-marketing/branding/selling your soul, you&#8217;re probably doing some of it already without even realising it (I&#8217;ve talked about some of this in <em><a href="../../../06/heather-fenoughty-personality-branding.html"><strong>Personality Branding</strong></a></em>).</p>
<p><strong>And</strong>&#8230; if it sells more of your work or your services, what you complainin&#8217; about? :-)</p>
<p>Here are all of the ways I can think of (so far) that a film music composer may market themselves. I&#8217;ve separated them out into whether I&#8217;ve used them or not, and how useful they&#8217;ve been up &#8217;til now. Hopefully you can pick out a few to start forming an easy strategy for marketing your wares and yourself.</p>
<p>This turned into rather a long list so stick with it&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Marketing Stuff that really works &#8211; directly led to sales: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Online portfolio website with music and contact details</li>
<li>DVD Showreel ready to go upon request</li>
<li>Tailored CD submissions</li>
<li>Music licensing on other site which led to commissions</li>
<li>Content marketing (fancy name for blog attached to website): writing blog posts about opinions and thoughts about my experiences. This is all about building a connection with audience, fleshing out a more thorough picture of yourself, what you&#8217;re like as a person to work with rather than just a faceless, personality-less, unknown quantity.</li>
<li>Networking in person and seeing it as an opportunity to make connections for people with other people.</li>
<li>Having an elevator pitch ready to go&#8230; then getting out of the way, asking questions, listening, really engaging in creating the potential for a new business relationship.</li>
<li>Twitter for both forging new relationships and developing ones already made through other methods.</li>
<li>Maintaining and keeping tabs on pre-made business relationships on Facebook.</li>
<li>Word of Mouth recommendations from people you&#8217;ve worked with before. Isn&#8217;t as tricky as you might first think &#8211; be easy to work with, go above and beyond, add value, and make the client feel special (&#8216;cos they are &#8211; they&#8217;re working with you aren&#8217;t they?).</li>
<li>Working in associated roles &#8211; this is really a form of networking. The word-of-mouth that you can gain about you being a really cool person and being great to work with works wonders when you hear about new projects coming up and you offer music composition/sound design!</li>
<li>Collaborating with other artists in relevant areas for free or as equally paid co-creators in order to raise both of our profiles.</li>
<li>Doing really awesome work with awesome people on awesome shows with high profile venues/channels with massive audiences is worth its weight in gold (though this probably counts a word of mouth too).</li>
<li>Giving away free CDs of pre-composed music to trusted filmmakers to license whenever they might like to in the future. Sometimes they&#8217;ll come back to you for a bespoke version or even a new commission.</li>
<li>Participating on relevant trade forums.</li>
<li>Sending showreel CDs out to local and national production companies. I actually did this without checking whether they wanted to hear it first, tut tut. Even though it worked for me, right at the start of my career when I was a little fraidy-cat when it came to cold calling, it was such a small response &#8211; 3 replies from 100+ CDs sent out &#8211; that really, I spent an awful lot of money that could have been saved just by making a few phone calls. Though you never know&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Marketing stuff that probably worked indirectly, though I don&#8217;t know for sure, or methods I&#8217;ve implemented so recently that&#8217;s it&#8217;s hard to say what effect it&#8217;s yet to have:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Website SEO (search engine optimisation)</li>
<li>Building a website with a CMS or &#8216;Content Management System&#8217; (e.g. wordpress, joomla) that&#8217;s very easily update-able with news, presents a more unified site where the blog isn&#8217;t just an add on, and where you don&#8217;t need to go into the code to make site-wide changes.</li>
<li>Asking for testimonials for your website &#8211; also reminds the client how great it was working with you. ;-)</li>
<li>Following up with email note after networking meetings (&#8216;great to meet you&#8217; type stuff).</li>
<li>Business cards handed out at networking events and included in showreel mailouts.</li>
<li>Trade press and general newspaper interviews.</li>
<li>Relevant website interviews.</li>
<li>Writing articles for relevant websites (such as this one).</li>
<li>Email signature including links to my latest work on- or off-line.</li>
<li>Twitter-driven traffic to my website &#8211; these visitors tend to stay around on the website a little longer than the average.</li>
<li>Scheduling tweets for Twitter to maintain a more consistent, steady online presence and reach more followers in all the different timezones.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />
Marketing stuff I&#8217;ve tried that hasn&#8217;t worked for me so far (but might for you&#8230; but it&#8217;s dubious, and if you don&#8217;t have time or money or energy, then maybe don&#8217;t bother):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Private online music store selling mp3s and music licenses for media attached to my website.</li>
<li>A website built on flash &#8211; very little search engine traffic at all as most of it can&#8217;t be indexed.</li>
<li>&#8220;Faking it &#8217;til you make it&#8221;/exaggerating your achievements/pretending to be something you&#8217;re not personality-wise &#8211; you get found out eventually! It&#8217;s so tiring to keep up the facade consistently.</li>
<li>Following general marketing gurus and social media &#8216;experts&#8217; on Twitter.</li>
<li>Following lots and lots of people on Twitter &#8211; signal to noise ratio gets less and less favourable, even though your follow stats are high. They aren&#8217;t really a targeted audience.</li>
<li>Premium, i.e. paid-for, online portfolio/cv sites &#8211; e.g. Productionbase</li>
<li>&#8220;Working the Room&#8221; at industry networking events &#8211; no real, viable relationships formed as a result of constantly looking for instant &#8216;usefulness&#8217; indicators in conversations, looking over shoulders at other people who might be more &#8216;useful.&#8221; This behavior doesn&#8217;t really give the best impression.</li>
<li>Music &#8220;giveaways.&#8221; I tried this once and it didn&#8217;t work&#8230; but it might next time.</li>
<li>Myspace page (although I didn&#8217;t put a lot of effort into it)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stuff I haven&#8217;t tried yet so can&#8217;t say either way. But these tips might send your business into the stratosphere, so am not ruling them out yet:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Professional logo design.</li>
<li>Headshots/professional photography (technically I have but it was for a different business &#8211; a live string group &#8211; and wasn&#8217;t really the right style for what I wanted to promote for my freelance composition).</li>
<li>Professional web design.</li>
<li>Hired professional PR and marketing services.</li>
<li>Email list marketing (round-robins, news updates)</li>
<li>Using bookmarking sites and comments on other blogs to drive traffic to my site (not intentionally anyway)</li>
<li>Paid-for ghostwriters for blog content.</li>
<li>Paid advertisements &#8211; e.g. Telephone directories on and offline, in trade magazines, on relevant trade websites.</li>
<li>Real-world thank you notes (vs email, which I actually do quite a lot).</li>
<li>Professionally printed branded headed note paper, &#8216;with compliments&#8217; slips, holiday cards etc.</li>
<li>Pursuing the press e.g. having a press pack ready, calling the press with a pre-made story or angle.</li>
<li>Video interviews/vlog (e.g. on your blog).</li>
<li>Branded associated merchandise &#8211; hats, cups, tshirts, bags, stuffed animals&#8230;</li>
<li>Reverbnation page (technically I&#8217;ve got a page. but I&#8217;ve not put anything of interest on it. So can&#8217;t really claim to be an authority on this one)</li>
<li>Publicity &#8220;stunts.&#8221;</li>
<li>Cold-calling production companies. (I take the easy route and ask my working friends and colleagues who I&#8217;ve met through networking or working alongside in related media who work at those companies, what&#8217;s going on there. So, technically, it&#8217;s warm-calling).</li>
</ul>
<p>Final word &#8211; and this is as technical as I&#8217;m going to get&#8230;</p>
<p>As media composers and sound designers, we are B2B &#8211; business to business &#8211; rather than B2C &#8211; business to consumer. We sell our services or our previously composed music to producers of other media as raw material for them to sculpt into the product that will be sold to the consumer &#8211; the audience. So a lot of the advice for marketing for musicians you may find on the web or offline, unless specifically for media music composers and sound designers, isn&#8217;t actually that relevant.</p>
<p>Ultimately, rather than focussing on the product, we&#8217;re aiming to be service providers &#8211; you&#8217;re selling you: your working personality, your style of collaboration, your creativity-on-tap. You can&#8217;t really afford to just let the music &#8216;speak for itself&#8217;. That&#8217;s your past. What you&#8217;re selling is in your future. Who you are as an artist. Your creative soul.</p>
<p>If that doesn&#8217;t scare you then you&#8217;re probably in the right business. Go get &#8216;em, tiger.</p>

<p>They are going to talk to people they know, who they believe are in the know, who think they know the best person for the job. So, if you want the job you have to be the biggest a**hole possible.

<p>Along the lines of &#8220;Networking in person and seeing it as an opportunity to make connections for people with other people.&#8221; I would just add an encouragement to try to make &#8220;real&#8221; friends from your contacts, if you guys really get along well. Go out and do stuff together, grab a bite to eat, and don&#39;t always bring work into it. It&#39;s easy to tell if your relationship is based solely on trying to get work out of them, and that can often be a turn-off. Be friends first and teammates second.</p>

<p>&#8220;The biggest ***hole&#8221; is NOT  the person the studios are looking to partner with, no matter who you&#39;ve &#8220;sleep around&#8221; with. In fact, Fox, Warners, Dreamworks, and Disney have been painfully clear and upfront about the fact that they are not interested in working with difficult people. The heads of music at these organizations are very astute and are not swayed in the least by tactics and games like those you suggest. In the modern area of Business 2.0, you cannot and will not get away with simply being a better bullshitter than the next person. If you do not have the goods to back up your rhetoric, including but not limited to effectively publicizing the project in favor of your partners, you will never see a meeting. Screw who you might, you&#39;d be on the wrong track there, I&#39;m afraid. Therefore, it stands to reason that many of Heather&#39;s suggestions, while completely rooted in self-promotion, are relevant to the point that she has a long-established track record of delivering once she&#39;s through the door.</p>
<p>As far as directors being &#8220;too busy&#8221;&#8230; look around. They are all doing the same thing, albeit on different levels and mediums. My caution would be to not confuse the the infancy of a new paradigm of advertising with the even more infinitesimal possibility of it not being relevant at all.</p>
<p>Bottom-line—You sound like someone who&#39;s been beat out before by a &#8220;fast-tracker&#8221;. I think if you can find a way to rein in your jaded perspective a bit, you&#39;d be surprised as to what you&#39;ll be able to accomplish.</p>
<p>Glad we had this talk. :oP</p>

I wouldn&#39;t say that you absolutely have to have a DVD showreel, only that I&#39;ve been asked for them in the past and they have swung the gig in my favour. I&#39;ve heard a more and more that these days producers and directors are also asking for online video showreel clips in preference to offline media. Something to consider (and I forgot to put it on the list! doh!).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had many conversations with people, who are on one or the other side of the social media thing.  I believe social media is neither good or bad.  It&#39;s a channel.  We all have our own distribution now, our own channel showing brand &#39;you&#39; &#8211; whether or not you can get anyone to listen/care is up to you, your content, and how well you position yourself.  There is a new paradigm of openness and connectedness, in that artists are more &#39;direct to fan&#39; &#8211; even film composers, etc.  Just having Facebook/Twitter/ etc does not help you, just as there are many who succeed without these things.  It&#39;s simply another tool, with a lot of possibilities.</p>
<p>I think there are many untapped ways to connect with people that aren&#39;t being taken advantage of.  The best way to get &#39;in&#39; with someone is to offer them something first.  If you can think of something valuable that you are willing to selflessly give away without requiring a return, then social media can help put that offer into the hands of someone that pre-SM you would have had to go through many gatekeepers to reach.  Giving them something selflessly can be a way to forge a real, meaningful connection.</p>
<p>My feeling is that it&#39;s not so much about the method as it is about finding that angle that you deliver in that method which has to hook someone in.</p>
<p>I indirectly know a performer, virtually unknown but with a great sounding CD and resume, who simply Facebooked an A-list composer and made a friendly connection.  Something caught on with this person, and next thing you know this performer was flying off to accompany the composer in a live performance of their work in a high profile festival.  Never say never!</p>

In-person and online networking is how I&#8217;ve connected with most of the projects I&#8217;ve worked on.  Though I do find it easy to become preoccupied/absorbed with making music and having fun with all the new technologies available to composers, so I sometimes have to remind myself to get out there and connect with people, to give fate room to groove (i.e. be in situations where I might meet right person at the right time).</p>
<p>I also try to keep in mind that even though opportunities can come at you in unexpected ways, it&#8217;s worthwhile to keep networking in the usual/predictable ways, so that you&#8217;re in the right frame of mind when something comes up.  One of the most rewarding gigs I&#8217;ve had to date came together after meeting someone in the audience at a seminar put on by a veteran composer.  A big chunk of my regular bread-and-butter work started after I reconnected with an old friend on Facebook.  Yet at the same time I&#8217;ve attended networking events where the explicit purpose was to help media professionals connect with each other, and I&#8217;ve joined a few online communities built around the same goal, with no prospects so far.
