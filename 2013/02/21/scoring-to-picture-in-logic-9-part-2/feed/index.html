					<description><![CDATA[No problem! :) 

In case youÂ´re interested, not only you have Notes where I mentioned but also specific notes under each track in the Mixer in case you want to write something down for that track precisely as opposed to the whole project. Thanks for reading and commenting, David!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Glenn! Thanks for your kind words, good to know it is helpful! :)
Actually I would like to write another article just about the sub-templates because I use them SO much. I find them really useful and time saving! Your questions:

I do use different sub templates according to instrument family and main articulations of each, for example Subtemplate Strings (legato, sustains, pizz, staccati - you name it), Subtemplate Brass (idem) etc instead of just one big Orchestral Template. This is just my way but helps me add very quickly some instrument in different styles, in such a way that strings can be added to orchestral stuff and pop, for example. Again this changes if youÂ´re writing very often on one particular style such as orchestral (then youÂ´d most likely need a specific template for that) but for me it saves time and resources and allows big flexibility. The sub templates I create as independent projects directly under Logic main folder (inside Music in your main HD) and like this my Logic browser can find them very quickly.

About the content of the sub template, I for one donÂ´t include plugins because I want to adapt them to every individual project; otherwise IÂ´m afraid IÂ´d tend to use always the same reverb for example and IÂ´d feel tempted to sounding quite similar all the time, but this is just me. 

In general, for me working module like instead of using big templates helps me keep my workflow agile and open - but maybe because I donÂ´t seem to be asked twice to write in the same style! Again, this all must serve your writing so you can be as specific and specialised as you wish in your set up, which is the beauty of it :)
Anyway I hope to write more about this subject in a separate article, let me know if you have more questions or I didnÂ´t manage to explain myself! 

Thanks for commenting and happy writing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much David! Glad to be of any help, IÂ´m far from having the biggest experience or knowledge in many fields but the little I know IÂ´m happy to share if it can be helpful for others. I work quite comfortably in Logic so it would be great to see other Logic users get the same positive experience! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Yaiza, thanks a lot for these fantastic hands-on work flow tips! Amazingly simple and powerful... Regarding sub-templates: would it be a good practice to build several instrument modules and import those at will when working on a project, in order to keep CPU overhead down, rather than building a giant orchestral + ethnic + synths + soundscapes template? And if so, how would you go about creating these subtemplates? As genuine templates or as projects in some dedicated folder? And how much would you load inside the template? (i.e. you can load settings without loading the actual plugins for example)... So many questions :-) I love seeing more!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Â Thanks Jorge! Well I do love many of LogicÂ´s features for writing to picture and IÂ´m very used to working with it (so I love the tool so to speak) but I overall love the idea of having a choice between many platforms of all sorts - keeps up the need of offering more and better to audio professionals. Logic is the DAW IÂ´ve used the most so it does feel home to me! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Â Hi Stephen,

Apologies for taking me so long to get back to you.
I for one have always used 48k for scoring to picture (as opposed to other kind of writing), I can also confirm itÂ´s the current industry standard recommended for scoring to picture in Logic (by Apple certification programme I mean) Â  - however so far I am not aware that if itÂ´s affected by the sample rate of the libraries used. Maybe some other composers can share their input on this?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Stephen,Â 
very good question.I&#039;m positive that most people working for picture uses 48K.In case you work with libraries only, bouncing at 48 is fine.As you know, if you&#039;re using audio as well you&#039;ll benefit being at 48.Like if you&#039;re import an mp3 and convert it to 48 K it still have the mp3quality.The only reason (44) it will be if you&#039;re doing cd&#039;s, if not use the standard (48).hope this helps.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Yaiza, thanks for all the extra Logic info. Just curious (after zooming in on your screenshot) besides you, how many other Logic users keep their sessions at 48k? I&#039;ve actually never done that, and always bounce mixes out at 48k as needed. Just wondering how that works going forward. Does it matter what the sample rate of libraries are? And how will that mix if my YEARS of work are at 44k. Output &quot;used&quot; to be for CDs. Will it be more of a headache? Thanks. : &#062;]]></description>
