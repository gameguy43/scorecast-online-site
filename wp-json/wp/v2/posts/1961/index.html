In the Global Tracks you can find a dedicated track for the movie where you can import it and see it on the Video Track or you can also import it from <b>File \/ Open Movie<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>For setting up the synchronisation, you can adjust the settings in <b>Project Settings \/ Synchronisation<\/b> (frame rate and bar position in reference to SMTPE) and <b>Project Settings \/ Video<\/b> (Movie Start field).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/2013\/01\/17\/scoring-to-picture-in-logic-9-part-1\/synchronisation\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1977\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1977 aligncenter\" alt=\"Synchronisation\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/Synchronisation-389x243.png\" width=\"389\" height=\"243\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/Synchronisation-389x243.png 389w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/Synchronisation-640x400.png 640w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/Synchronisation.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It\u00b4s always prudent to double check these parameters are well adjusted by checking the burnt in SMPTE code of your clip coincides all along the project with the SMPTE display in Logic (in the transport bar, you can even find an independen giant display)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>Now my movie plays smoothly in Logic- how to start scoring?<\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Once you have those specifications clear the next step is to display in Logic that mental map that you have of how you want to score your scene. How?<\/p>\n<p>One of the major characteristics of writing music to picture is that the structure of the cue shall be shaped by the events in the clip instead of being bar \/ musical divisions based. This is what will make navigating the project a bit different!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Having in mind what hit points you don\u00b4t want to miss in your movie and will shape its structure, the easiest way to keep them and navigate through them is by using Markers. After a spotting session, every relevant event (entry of a cue, change of mood, hit points, etc) can be marked in the exact SMTPE position using markers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For locating those precise time references you can use the<b> Go to Position<\/b> key command (\/) and write there the SMTPE position you want to locate and press Return; Logic\u00b4s playhead will have found that precise spot and there you can create a marker without rounding. This means the marker will be placed at exactly the SMTPE position indicated instead of approximating it to the next bar as it would be helpful when songwriting.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/2013\/01\/17\/scoring-to-picture-in-logic-9-part-1\/go-to-position\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1978\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1978 aligncenter\" alt=\"Go to position\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/Go-to-position-389x243.png\" width=\"389\" height=\"243\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/Go-to-position-389x243.png 389w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/Go-to-position-640x400.png 640w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/Go-to-position.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>You can create markers without rounding in <b>Option\/Marker\/ Create without roundin<\/b>g or use a key command for it (will vary on your keyboard, by default all key commands involving Markers tend to include letter \u201cK\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Once the markers are defined, you can find them in Lists (by default there is a direct access to it in the right up corner). There you can rename them and you will find also space to type any notes regarding that hitpoint that you might need.<\/p>\n<p>However, the most important task now once the markers are conveniently defined is to SMTPE lock them so they will remain unmoved in their position if the project\u00b4s tempo is modified. For this you can simply right click on the marker and select \u201c<b>Lock SMTPE position<\/b>\u201d or use the Option local menu of the Marker List. You will see a little lock icon appear next to the marker, indicating it\u00b4s been locked.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/2013\/01\/17\/scoring-to-picture-in-logic-9-part-1\/markers\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1979\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1979 aligncenter\" alt=\"Markers\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/Markers-389x243.png\" width=\"389\" height=\"243\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/Markers-389x243.png 389w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/Markers-640x400.png 640w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/Markers.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>A very handy feature here is <b>Detect Cuts<\/b>, that you can find in the Video Global Track and captures major visual changes and helps you spot potential hit points that your score may want to underline. It will also by default find the beginning and end of the movie. It might help you locate some points and if you\u00b4re not happy with them, you can always delete them from the list.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One more thing to make the marker list more friendly: you can choose to show the position of each marker in SMTPE units rather than in using its absolute position in the local menu <b>View\/Event position and length in SMTPE units<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Once the markers are well defined and locked, a helpful tip can be to colour them in order to visually find them quicker; as with any other region in Logic, this can be easily done by selecting the marker and using the colour palette by pressing <b>OPT+C<\/b> and choosing the desired colour on it. The same colours shall appear in the Markers list, making it easy to differenciate them one another.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>Now, how to quickly navigate markers?<\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There are two main ways; one, in the Arrange, using the key commands for it (you can define them as any key commands or choose the default ones in Option\/ Markers): <b>Go to previous \/ next marker<\/b>, or <b>Go to Marker Number<\/b> \u201cx\u201d. This will accelerate your navigation of the project quite dramatically, especially because it allows you to navigate flexibly and conceptually rather than using a bar-based grid (which again is great for songwriting but not so much for rhapsodic scoring to picture).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The second way is using the <b>Marker List<\/b>; you can CMD click on the desired marker (this brings by default the Finger Tool) and the playhead will follow it. Some composers also like to have the Markers List as an independent window (that can be opened by using OPT+M) maybe to be used in a second screen!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/2013\/01\/17\/scoring-to-picture-in-logic-9-part-1\/marker-list-window\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1980\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1980 aligncenter\" alt=\"Marker list window\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/Marker-list-window-389x243.png\" width=\"389\" height=\"243\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/Marker-list-window-389x243.png 389w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/Marker-list-window-640x400.png 640w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/Marker-list-window.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yaiza Varona guides you through the procedure of setting up Logic to score a movie, importing the movie and properly syncing it to your project. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":28,"featured_media":1983,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_is_tweetstorm":false},"categories":[687,999,1062],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/Browser1.png","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p202Ia-vD","_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1961"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/28"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1961"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1961\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1983"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1961"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1961"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1961"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
