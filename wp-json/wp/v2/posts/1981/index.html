Here we will see the one that should be faster!<\/p>\n<p>It basically consists in assigning whatever channels of similar material you have to a particular bus, that you will later use as an independent track on its own.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u00b4s say something in the line: tracks 1-7 go to bus 1 called Strings, 8-9 to bus 2 called Bass, 10 to 17 to bus 3 called Drums&#8230;you name it. By doing so you are creating some aux channels in the mixer devoted to stem groups. Now, to record those stems, we shall use the outputs of each of those submixes as input sources of new tracks in the arrange.<br \/>\nSo, in the Arrange we create new audio tracks using the buses as input (as many as buses we created and we choose the first and go ascending). Now, if we click Record for the whole length of the track, these new tracks shall contain the stems.<\/p>\n<p><em>That&#8217;s all ladies and gentlemen!
