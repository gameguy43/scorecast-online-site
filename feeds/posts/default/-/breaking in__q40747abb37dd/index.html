Not unless you consider hard work, lots of rejection, or a healthy bent toward self-determination a \"magic bullet\". Is there an easy way in? The answer, as with most things in life, is \"no\". Most things that are worth doing don't come easy. However, there are many tried and true methods as well as some proven principles that most of us here at SCO can safely say we've built our working careers on.

In fact, I would say that the more legit your recording session is, the tougher it is to pay for. An example would be a union scale production. If you are working on an independent film where YOU are the orchestrator, the copyist, the contractor, and ultimately the player, then it becomes quite clear how the music budget should be planned because YOU are the only one getting paid. However, on a studio budgeted film where there are hundreds of thousands — if not millions — of dollars to be played with, there is obviously a lot more to consider.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cdiv class\u003d\"separator\" style\u003d\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.istockphoto.com/file_thumbview_approve/4146593/2/istockphoto_4146593-stack-of-cash.jpg\" imageanchor\u003d\"1\" style\u003d\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"\u003e\u003cimg border\u003d\"0\" height\u003d\"158\" src\u003d\"http://www.istockphoto.com/file_thumbview_approve/4146593/2/istockphoto_4146593-stack-of-cash.jpg\" width\u003d\"200\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003eHiring union musicians can cost you anywhere from $261 to $315 per player, per hour... depending on if you are overdubbing or not, but you also have to figure in your concertmaster and your contractor (they make double scale), cartage fees, studio assistants, room costs, engineers, ProTools operators, specialty musicians (The George Doering's of the world), and whatever else your score needs to get recorded. Room costs are very important to consider, because if you are recording a 60-piece group you are going to need a stage versus a \"record room\" (a studio typically set up to record smaller orchestras for rock and pop performances) that will better accommodate an orchestra — the latter of which will cost you considerably less.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eA couple of years ago, I was assisting a composer who had been handed his first major studio assignment. I was only doing production work on source material for the film, but I was close enough to see some of the ins and outs that this guy had to go through as a fairly new player in the game. It was interesting, to say the least, but the biggest thing I learned while on that job was that, for whatever reason, this composer had no idea of how to budget for musicians. You would know the name of the movie if I told you what it was, so we aren't talking about a little independent flick here. No, this was a full-fleged studio film in the 170 million overall budget range (and that's just what was reported publicly).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAbout three weeks before the delivery deadline, after all of the orchestral sessions and pre-records were in the can, the composer realized that he had not budgeted enough money for an adequate final mix of the score. He was about $30,000 short. Everyone on our team of six went to work calling in favors and figuring out how we could divide up the mix in hopes of getting it done, handed in on time and under budget. After we all spent the last week of production with zero sleep and a constant ringing in our ears because of no breaks, the score was finally delivered. Needless to say, it was a rough final week.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI remember being so excited to go see the film in the theater. That score was hard work and we all were looking forward to premiere night. As the opening scene whizzed by, another assistant on the team leaned over to me, jaw on the ground, and whispered, \"Thank God for the effects or we'd be thrown out of this theater.\" The mix was atrocious. Absolutely unlistenable. And now, when I am at someone's home and their children are watching the film on BluRay or DVD, I can hear each painful note coming through loud and... distorted.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eSchedules\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIsn't it always the schedule that kills ya? In my experience, the best composers spend as much time writing music as they can, and as little time screwing with computers as they can. It really is *that* simple! The schedule is the schedule is the schedule. It is what it is. There's often no changing it, no making it better. With that in mind, write! Spend every minute you have writing. Forget tweaking sounds or getting the computer to respond quicker, or cleaning your studio. (By the way — if you are one of those people who say \"I cannot function in a cluttered studio\", then you have clearly never worked on a studio feature! I haven't been in a studio production hub yet that didn't look like a Level 5 hurricane swept through it!)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd before we go any further, let me clarify something: \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\"Writing\" does \u003ci\u003eNOT\u003c/i\u003e mean:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e· Sequencing mock-ups.\u003c/b\u003e This can be hired out and it is well worth the expense when you consider how long it takes to accomplish.

While this is not something you should hire out, it is important to educate your directors and producers early to the fact that the more time they want to sit and bullshit about how great John Williams is, the more time they are going to need to allot you to make their score great as well. Sometimes, creative people think they are the only ones that need space and solitude to create. It's weird, but it's true.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOn sequencing, most composers I've worked for have people in their studios that do all of that for them. Chill out! They oversee it ALL, so nobody is ghosting or taking liberties with lead lines and harmonies. But what *is* happening is the composer is able to multiply himself/herself in such a way that all of this work gets done and the project stays on schedule. I know composers whose studios run 24/7. \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004581/\"\u003eHarry Gregson-Williams\u003c/a\u003e, for one, has a crew come in when the \"day crew\" leaves so that production can run throughout the night - like a musical 7 Eleven!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cdiv class\u003d\"separator\" style\u003d\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.viev.com/images/vievstock/scheduling_solutions_small_355048.jpg\" imageanchor\u003d\"1\" style\u003d\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"\u003e\u003cimg border\u003d\"0\" height\u003d\"150\" src\u003d\"http://www.viev.com/images/vievstock/scheduling_solutions_small_355048.jpg\" width\u003d\"200\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003eLook, you can talk about it however you want to talk about it and you can have whatever view on it you want to have, but I'll tell you straight up how it is: Big-budget studio films do not get done with one guy anymore. It just doesn't happen. This business is a business of \u003ci\u003e\u003cu\u003eteams\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/i\u003e - and it has nothing to do with the talent of the composer, whether he is lacking or she is amazing. It has to do with the schedules imposed by the studios to get these things finished on time and without overrun. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd it's only going to get worse. The music team's technology used to be the leader in the movie-making industry. We used to have the coolest toys. That's not necessarily true anymore. Special effects digitization, motion-capture technology, and CGI animation has eclipsed the coolness factor of any music-related software that is out there, and in turn, has created ever shorter schedules and timeframes for getting things done in post-production. Like it or not, we *have* to keep up with that - and so we find whatever way we can to cope. One of my mentors last year at school said, \"More dotties equals more bodies!\"\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eCreative Finance\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOne last thing on money: Use it as a tool. Too many composers who are just starting out think of money as a \"consumable resource\" instead of a \"tool\". Just because you are being paid from one job this month doesn't mean that you need to use it to go on vacation next month. Instead, use it to pay for a little bit better group of musicians on next month's gig. Further your career with whatever money you make. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhen I was working this last year for SCO founder Deane Ogden, we worked on a picture that had a very small music expense budget — well under what was necessary to complete a solid dramatic score with a live ensemble. After negotiating the creative fee, Deane trusted his instincts for the legs of the project and took the gig. As it turns out he was right - the film is in negotiations to be picked up by one of the big four and is on its way to theaters later this year... but not without a score that involved star international soloists, a live 30-piece orchestra, live group percussion of monumental proportions, and a professional mix and master by a top Hollywood engineer. AND we all got paid and ate great throughout the entire process! (Mmm... I love me some yummins!)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWe cut no corners on this score. Everything was top-notch. But what we *did* do was use left-over budget from a prior package deal where Deane had taken a smaller cut home in order to save dough for a bigger, badder orchestra on that next project.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWe made that few extra G's work in our favor in ways that you wouldn't believe. Our soloists were all international, so they recorded their parts in their respective studios live in realtime, and were able to communicate through each session over iChat AV. We also rented certain instruments we didn't have access to, as opposed to sampling them, so that we could record nuances and articulations that are not always present in sampled form, thus giving the sampled performances that much more of a realistic edge.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTowards the end of the recording process, we ran up against a situation where we needed to hire a player who was not in the union. I called the union and was able to work out a deal to \u003ca href\u003d\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taft%E2%80%93Hartley_Act#Entertainment_industry\"\u003e\"Taft Hartley\"\u003c/a\u003e the player onto the project. Not only did we get the player we wanted, but also now that person is enjoying a great relationship with the Local 47 as a full-fledged member.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere are many more secrets and techniques that made this particular score special, but at every turn we forced ourselves to think  outside the box.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eIs This Doable?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eYou CAN do this stuff. You just have to think. Most of what I'm talking about here has to do with putting away your fear and really hanging your musical ass out there on the line. It *really* does. Is it scary to think about possibly sacrificing your take for the sake of a better sounding score? Yes! Is it tough to schedule time away from the sequencer in order to really conceptualize a killer idea for the overall musical arc? Yes!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut see... it is these things, when you really dig out the info, that separates the pettily little Jai Meghans from the gargantuanly ginormous James Newton-Howards.

Because of that, today is my last day of full-time work at my current place of employment, Deane Ogden Music. This has easily been the best job I've had since moving to Los Angeles in 2004 and I will miss it greatly. Deane has generously taught me things about how to be a great composer and how to treat the people that you work with like royalty, and his influence on me is deep - I will miss hanging out with him, working alongside him, and watching a master craftsman accomplish his work.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eDeane and Lee have asked me to stay on as managing editor of SCOREcastOnline.com, a position I accepted with a big fat smile on my face. One of the greatest things I've ever done in my life is have a hand in  the creation of such a fabulous community of people as SCOREcast. We should not take lightly the generosity these two guys have shown in building this resource for all of us.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLast night, I was thinking about my career thusfar and how far I have come, and it was pretty overwhelming. Sometimes when you feel like you aren't moving forward as quickly as you'd like to be, and then you write down everything you've accomplished so far, you realize you've done a lot. I've had people ask me why I haven't struck out on my own yet as a composer and the truth is I just feel like I'm not ready to fly solo quite yet. I'm giving it another few months.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBecause of the importance of the day, I'm in a bit of a sentimental mood. I wanted to get some thoughts down to you guys about my experiences so far. I'm not sure where I'm going with this, so it might not follow any kind of formal format, but they are my thoughts, nonetheless. I think they are worth something.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI've been a studio scoring assistant for several years now, all while working my way through school at USC. My advisers have told me that the way I'm doing it is right - to take it easy while I'm in school  before I get out there on my own, instead of trying to squeak by and scrimp and save as a student. Instead, I've decided to learn as much as I possibly can from people who are actually making a living in the film music business - composers who have \"hit it\" in terms of finding a way to live comfortably and stay successful over the long haul.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut man... it has been a long journey. Under my current composer, SCOREcast founder \u003ca class\u003d\"zem_slink\" href\u003d\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1676420/\" rel\u003d\"imdb\" title\u003d\"Deane Ogden\"\u003eDeane Ogden\u003c/a\u003e, I've learned a ton. I also worked at Remote Control for quite awhile and that was an education all in itself. I work hard at learning this craft, and I would heartily recommend that anyone who is considering a career in film music assist a composer for a time before you launch out on your own. It will give you a head start that can not be obtained in any other way.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt kind of sounds mean, but the truth is that you can short-cut a lot of bullshit by watching someone else find their way through something. However, that is the essence of assisting - yes, you are there to help pull off something that maybe cannot be pulled off as a solo act, but for YOU, there is an education in front of you that should not be taken for granted. The fact that you can learn by seeing every possible situation come about without getting any of it on you, per se, is priceless.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHere are a few things, and a few stories, from my experience.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eCompensation\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFirst of all,  do not expect to make a fortune working as an assistant. I started out as an intern at Remote Control working for school credit, assisting several A-list and B-list (several who are \u003ci\u003enow\u003c/i\u003e A-list) composers. I spent a lot of time orchestrating and programming. The first time I made any money was toward the end of my first year there working on the music team for the film \"\u003ca class\u003d\"zem_slink\" href\u003d\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399201/\" rel\u003d\"imdb\" title\u003d\"The Island (2005 film)\"\u003eThe Island\u003c/a\u003e\" with composer Steve Jablonsky. I wrote several arrangements for some of the source music on the film, not a very glamorous first job, but I was so happy to finally be making some cash doing anything musically related.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe first time I earned a solid wage (and by \u003ci\u003esolid\u003c/i\u003e, I simply mean \u003ci\u003econsistent\u003c/i\u003e) as an assistant wasn't until a year after \"The Island\" when I began working on the music team for \"Pirates of the Caribbean II and III\". I made $15 an hour working on those two films as an assistant to several composers under the Remote Control roof. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBasically, there is no good answer to the question of compensation since the art of \"assisting\" is still relatively new in our business. It's odd, but even though technology has supposedly made things better for composers, the learning curve has created an entirely new role that is now necessary for film composers to fill - programmers and assistants.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eSchedules\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe hours on the \"Pirates\" gigs were ridiculous... sometimes 16 or 17 hour days for weeks straight. I was paid every other week. Sometimes I'd work in upwards of 20 hours a day, only sleeping an hour here and an hour there. It was brutal. Since working for Deane, I might work 30 hours a week. BIG difference. Truth be told, working at Deane's is completely different work than working anywhere else I have worked. Laid back, clear cut, no drama, precise. I know what my job is and I know what is expected. That is important when you are assisting. It still amazes me how most composers have zero idea what to have their assistants do every day, and a lot of time is wasted daily because of that. Since I started working for Deane, I've been able to write the scores to a few of my pals' student films, experience that I wouldn't have been able to find if I was still working a job that required 90+ hours a week of my time.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eYesterday, Deane wrote a fabulous \u003ca href\u003d\"../../../../../2009/09/balanced-composer.html\"\u003earticle\u003c/a\u003e for SCOREcast about balancing family with work. I've had this to contend with also, and I think I've done well. I have a beautiful wife and a sweet 1 year-old baby girl. We have plenty of time together even though I am in school and working a full-time job. This year, I will only have school to finish up, and I'm really looking forward to major time at home. Deane has been great, and during his downtime, he has given me blocks of time off that I've used to my advantage with my family.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSometimes I come in at 8AM, other times I don't get in until after lunch. Deane doesn't care as long as I get my work done. I have a punch list, and if it is done by the end of the day, what time I arrive doesn't matter. If he has a meeting in the morning, I will start work earlier so that things are covered while he's gone. If it is crunch time, well... we are in for the long haul until the project is finished. My family just knows that I'm under it for however long it takes.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eDuties\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI've done so many things for composers: studio rewires, software upgrades, additional composing, car washes, clothes shopping (yes!), and more. I'll tell you, I even was asked once by a composer that I was working  for to go pick up the dog doo in his yard while he took a phone call. This composer happened to be known for his practical joking, so I innocently asked, \"Really? Are you joking  or are you serious?\" He put his hands in the air and yelled, \"Do I look like I'm f*cking joking? GO!\"\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI \u003ci\u003edid\u003c/i\u003e go...  and after I was done picking up after the dog, I just kept going and never went back. The icing on the cake was months later, and I had moved on to working for Deane. Deane took me with him to a   BMI event and we ran into Poop Guy at the bar. He either didn't remember who I was, or he was too embarrassed to say \"hi\" to me. Deane said it was probably the latter... and to not worry... \"I don't have a dog... or a yard!\", he said with smile.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eProfessionalism\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI've also had the opportunity to work with a lot of great directors while assisting composers. Directors can be very difficult to work with, or they can be easy as hell. I've dealt with both, and I've seen how composers deal with them, too. Some do a great job at appeasing directors and getting them what they want, and some don't do so hot.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOne time, I was working for a composer who was doing a cue on spec for a film that he really wanted to score. The film was a huge one (you would know it by name), and he was very excited that he was even being considered for the job.\u0026nbsp; After demoing for the job with this spec cue, we received word that we would not be working on this film. My composer was pissed. He got up after the call came in, picked up a chair that was next to his desk, and threw it into a rack of (luckily) old defunct gear. The rack fell over and everything cascaded onto the floor. Guess who got to pick *that* up?!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI've always found it interesting that even to the big guys, not getting the gig is as frustrating as getting it is exciting.

I was in the room when he found out he didn't get a gig he was up for.

Looking back through my posts to the SCOREcast website, I see a theme in my work that suggests I like to break the rules. I guess it is inline with my original idea when I started the podcast back in 2006. I simply wanted to help other people getting into this business understand some of the lessons an independent composer might learn — both positive and negative — on this path of self-discovery that we call \"scoring films\", the ultimate goal being to bring to the forefront some of the issues that we composer types hate to talk about... and start talking about them.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAfter three years of doing this, and having now had so many great film music veterans chime in with their thoughts too, I now know for certain that those \"unspoken rules\" are cold-blooded career killers. There is no doubt about it. The insecurity of the \"never let them see you sweat\" attitude that pervades the composer culture nowadays is a poison that has been systemic in turning our community into a tiny hive of solitary-confined worker bees.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eComposing, especially the realm of independent composing, has always sort of been a \"vacuum\" career. You create alone, you hustle alone, you produce alone, you interface alone, you fight to be paid alone, and in the end you celebrate alone or suffer alone, depending on the outcome of all of your former suffering. The good news is that it changes as you ascend up the proverbial ladder, and as you become more successful, the model shifts into more of a team thing where then you are managing (and being managed by) a group of people who are all out for you, and you for them. But until then, it's all you baby!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo... you're alone. What could be worse than that, right? How about \u003ci\u003ebeing alone with nothing to work on?\u003c/i\u003e Now THAT sucks! The thing is that it's going to happen. It's not matter of \"if\", it's a matter of \"when\". At some point, no matter what you do, there are going to be times in your career when you have no projects in sight. It could be right now (maybe you've not worked on anything yet), or maybe you've been somewhat successful in the past and now, all of a sudden, you are facing a drought with no oasis on the horizon. It is during these times that it is hard as a composer for picture to stay motivated. Then you add on the \"aloneness\" factor, and things can get real dark real fast.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOften for us... \u003cu\u003e\u003ci\u003eComposer + No picture \u003d No motivation to write\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/u\u003e. Therefore, it just stands to reason that... \u003cu\u003e\u003ci\u003eComposer + No picture + Nobody \u003d No motivation to go out and get a picture to write to\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/u\u003e. At that point, it's basically Dead Man Walking.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe concept of the suffering artist is not new. How many times have you heard it said that we all, as artists, \"suffer for the sake of art\"? The trick is, however, to learn to learn to use the suffering to your benefit, and most of all, to learn to use the suffering to your benefit when it matters most... when there is no project on the horizon — to stay motivated during the doughts. It sounds silly, but it is so true. There is often no getting around the suffering part, and there is definitely no getting around the drought part either, but just like the literal, real-world version of it, suffering during a drought can lead to death. You have to have the internal fire to get yourself through it and keep forging ahead, in complete faith that the next thing is simply around the next bend.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI would offer that \"motivation\" is the internal fire and thus the antidote to \"suffering\".\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eDeveloping the Disciplne of Self-Motivation\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ePeople ask me all the time how I stay motivated when there is nothing in the pipeline. How, in a career that is powered solely by my will to get up in the morning and power through, project or no, do I stay excited to do so? The simple answer is this: I've been doing this long enough now that the schedule I keep (lining up my next project at least by the time I'm recording my current one) combined with my love for the craft is a natural motivator. However, the answer nobody wants to hear is that over time I've developed a strict regimen of \"motivation maintenance\", and I apply it daily in my life. This is something that I've learned out of listening to others that have gone before me... namely my father, Don Ogden, and my amazing manager, Michal Marks. My Pop has given gems of wisdom since I was old enough to retain cognitive memory and my manager is an ass-kicker who never lets me whine for more than 30 seconds about how tough life is. She's always teaching me new ways to get back up on the horse, and my dad taught me to \"have\" a horse to begin with, so there you have it.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe truth is that maintaining your motivation to create is actually a long-term journey. The first steps in that journey can be hard, but with discipline and consistency comes the reward of achieving motivation through minimal daily maintenance — a simple matter of learning to do the right things at the right time.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWe are all different people, made of different levels of \"chutzpah\", therefore there is going to be a different path to perpetual motivation for me than there is for you. It is going to be up to you to find the path that works best in your life, but I can promise you it will be made of a combination of listening to your gut, knowing your abilities, and learning how to coax, negotiate, and even trick yourself into being creative. Here, then, are some fundamentals that I have learned that will keep you traipsing through the sand during the next project drought that comes your way.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e1) Know Your Targets\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt's literally impossible to stay motivated if you don't know what you are trying to accomplish. You have to have goals. To me, goals are targets. Targets have to have identities. Name each project. Give it an identity, even if it doesn't come with one already. Treat it like it is a person standing in your studio watching you work. You cannot hit your targets when you don't know what they are.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e2) Realistically Pace Yourself\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eYou'll lose interest fast in staying motivated if you fail a lot when you are first trying to develop your creative momentum. Keep your targets small enough that you can hit them with some modicum of regularity, but large enough that you aren't underwhelming yourself creatively. Maybe short films are the way to go in preparation for your first Hollywood feature. Perhaps a web series would be a great starting block if you want to get into TV eventually. These \"smaller\" targets will help you prepare for the bigger ones waiting for you when you are ready. They aren't going anywhere! Be slow and methodical. Rome wasn't built in a day.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e3) Protect the Nest\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eYour studio is not a place for preparing your taxes, doing your online banking, or researching airline fares for flying home this Christmas. Make your studio a sanctuary of peace, tranquility, and music-making... ONLY. Ask any composer that has had any amount of success doing this and they will tell you, \"You need a place specifically set aside to be creative in.\" After you set yourself up in that creative space, spend time in it daily (or nightly if you are working an additional day job) and make sure you are there at the same time each day. After awhile, you'll start achieving creative success in that space, and once you do, your brain will start associating creative success with \u003ci\u003ethat\u003c/i\u003e space. The next thing that will happen is you will only be able to be \"creative\" there, and your studio will become a power-center in your life. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis is not some weird-ass cosmic thing I'm talking about here... so don't flip out and think I'm from Satan! I'm simply talking about using your studio as a place of creative power rather than another room in your house, or a space in a rental facility... a \"necessary expense\" to keeping your career moving. Your studio is much more than that. When I go in every day to the Musicave, my brain clicks into \"create\" mode, because that is all I've ever allowed my studio to be - a creative \"laboratory\" for my musical science experiments.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e4) Give It Time, but Don't Give It Up\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf you encounter a situation that seems insurmountable, give it a day or two if you have it to give, but do not give up and just lay down and die to it. No problem (and certainly no project) is ever truly insurmountable. Put problems and obstacles away for a second, but always come back and work on them later. Often times, you'll have more info by then, a better perspective by then, and a better idea of what to try that might be the catalyst for a breakthrough. My dad always taught me that \"Everything is always better after a good night's sleep.\" He is right. Take a break, take a nap, take a vacation if you have that kind of time... but never ever take the easy way out by quitting or giving up. Quitting is not characteristic of a winner, and to be successful in the film music biz being a winner is Film Composer 101.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e5) Identify Your \"Power Band\"\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI hear my partner in crime Lee Sanders talk about this concept all the time. Each of us has a time of day where we are most creative. Just like your body needs to sleep at certain times and eat at certain times, your brain also needs to be creative at certain times.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eYour brain has a creative \"power band\" and (unfortunately, an uncreative one, as well). My power band is in the wee hours of the morning, between the hours of 4 and 9AM. When everyone in my house is asleep, I seem to get the majority of my creative work finished. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI realize that the majority of composers reading this will disagree and say that their \"power band\" is at night and maybe even into the wee hours of night - completely opposite from me, and that's totally cool. It's whatever you know it to be. And... it could change as you grow. My creative time used to be at night when I was in my early twenties, and even still I have to pull the occasional all-nighter to get something delivered on time. But whether it is early morning, late night, or in the middle of the day after you eat a healthy lunch, you need to find and identify what time of day your brain is at its most creative, and then make it a point to create during that time. Reserve the least creative time of the day to do the things that you know even a monkey could do, but need to be done, nonetheless.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e6) Use the Right Tools\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHave you ever tried to use a butter knife as a Phillips head screw driver? C'mon! Yes you have! We all have. It seems like it would work, but it doesn't work so well. That's because in order to turn a Phillips head screw, you need a Phillips head screw driver. That type of fastener was simply made to be used with the right tool.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI observed this in action repeatedly by watching my father and my grandfather work together in our family's floor covering business. It never really hit home with me, however, until the day my father bought me my first professional drum set. After laying out over $4,000 of wages earned by crawling around on his hands and knees laying carpet in strangers' homes, he looked at me with tears in his eyes and said, \"To be great, son, it helps to have the right tools.\"\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThat lesson has stayed with me since, and after years of writing and playing music while using the tools of the trade that we all use, I cannot stress enough how true that really is. Working with the right gear makes all the difference. Conversely, working with inferior gear causes pain and heartache, and ultimately, when the stakes are critical, it will cost you jobs. You simply cannot afford to scrimp on your studio or your instruments. I have been a professional studio drummer for 30 years, and I've played about every manufacturer's drums that can be played. I'm not lying when I tell you that playing a custom-made and hand-crafted kit is so much easier and musical than playing a cheap assembly-line kit that anyone can buy at the local Walmart. I bet Tiger Woods would agree that playing with the best-made clubs he can find makes \"thinking\" about his game way easier.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhen you don't have to worry about your tools, you are free to worry about the stuff that matters. Don't cut corners here. Buy the best you can afford. Always.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e7) Monitor Your Progress\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI know people who cannot wait to wake up, log into IMDb Pro, and see if their \"Star Meter\" increased while they were sleeping. True story.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhile it might seem a little bit self-absorbed, I understand their excitement to a certain degree. Monitoring your progress can be excellent motivation to either do better, or keep doing what you are doing. Either way, stop and self-evaluate every once in awhile. Nothing but good can come from it, and since nobody loves you enough to *really* tell you the truth anyway (American Idol much?), why the hell not?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e8) Get Out in the World\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhile your nest will serve as your creative space, the world can serve as your \"inluential\" one. I'm a tea drinker, so many times I've set up shop in my local Coffee Bean to work on the more mundane tasks that our job demands — emails, invoices, payroll, website development, SCOREcast article writing... Just kidding! The Coffee Bean might not be as cozy and \"cocoon-ish\" as the Musicave is for me, but it provides an atmosphere that effects me differently than the Musicave does, and allows me to be influenced by things that will eventually find their way into music. Remember that we are responsible for supporting dramatic emotion in a musical way that every human hopefully can relate to. If we don't surround ourselves with humans every once in awhile, we'll almost certainly lose touch with the reality of human emotion and behavior, and then our music could become dry and empty.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e9) Pay Attention to Your Peers\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt is often helpful to listen to the work of others and pay attention to what others are up to. However, proceed with caution here... I ONLY do this to make sure that...\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u0026nbsp;#1) \u003cu\u003e\u003ci\u003eI'm not reinventing the wheel.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/u\u003e Why do stuff your way when someone else has found a more efficient way to accomplish the exact same thing? That's not innovative, that's just plain stupid.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e#2) \u003cu\u003e\u003ci\u003eMy work is up to industry standards.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/u\u003e You cannot turn in mediocre mixes, tracks with artifacts in them, or stems that are in the wrong formats and resolutions because industry standard delivery specifications have been established that will not tolerate those things. Find out what the standards are and either adopt them, or go one step further and make yours a level better.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe reason I say to only pay attention to others in these two instances is because if you constantly watch what everyone else is doing, then sooner or later you snap out of it and realize that only THEY have gotten music written while you have been standing there like a dumbass drooling over their accomplishments! You haven't done a thing! \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo, be careful... keep your finger on the pulse of the industry, but don't get so interested that you lose time.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e10) Do It Anyway\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMy manager constantly tells me this, and she is so right on: When you don't feel like writing, \u003ci\u003ewrite anyway.\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp; Force yourself to write. I mean, look... it's what we do. We. Write. Music. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAt first, it will seem awkward, clumsy, forced, and futile to just write when you feel you have nothing to write. After awhile though, you will start to feel your groove returning. You might still think what you are producing is the biggest bunch of noise in the world, but honestly... when you are in a funk, you aren't the best judge of your output anyway, so who the hell are you to say what is good when you think everything in life sucks at the moment? Do you see how silly that is?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMy manager says when you feel blue, write it. When you are happy, write THAT. When you are angry, write THAT. When you are scared, write THAT TOO! Just write. Just start doing it. Nine times out of ten, your creativity will come rushing in and you'll have three more cues in your library by the end of the day. Your momentum will return and you are back on that horse!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd believe me, that horse (life!) will do everything it can to buck you off again... but maybe next time you'll have the right tools to know what do.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cdiv class\u003d\"zemanta-pixie\" style\u003d\"height: 15px; margin-top: 10px;\"\u003e\u003ca class\u003d\"zemanta-pixie-a\" href\u003d\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/eb751cf0-9de8-41f3-9b21-e3e2d025f354/\" title\u003d\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\"\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" class\u003d\"zemanta-pixie-img\" src\u003d\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id\u003deb751cf0-9de8-41f3-9b21-e3e2d025f354\" style\u003d\"border: medium none; float: right;\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cscript defer\u003d\"defer\" src\u003d\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type\u003d\"text/javascript\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class\u003d\"blogger-post-footer\"\u003e\u003cimg width\u003d'1' height\u003d'1' src\u003d'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2957472132698657339-4372312439353563971?l\u003dwww.scorecastonline.com' alt\u003d'' /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"},"link":[{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2957472132698657339/posts/default/4372312439353563971"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2957472132698657339/posts/default/4372312439353563971"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"../../../../../2009/08/scoring-through-droughts.html","title":"Scoring Through the Droughts"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Deane Ogden"},"uri":{"$t":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/10128163732914887649"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$extendedProperty":{"xmlns$gd":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005","name":"OpenSocialUserId","value":"00458890414498824724"}}],"media$thumbnail":{"xmlns$media":"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/","url":"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/Sn4OX4qm7YI/AAAAAAAAAKI/ISxEOnkC-H0/s72-c/sig-ogden.png","height":"72","width":"72"}}]}});
