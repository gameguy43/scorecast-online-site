On the surface, the look and feel of a \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esmart sheet\u003c/span\u003e is similar to that of a conventional spreadsheet document – with rows and columns of \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ecells\u003c/span\u003e, and user interface functionality that makes it easy for you to enter, view, and manipulate your data in whatever way your particular collaboration methodology might require.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs a composer using \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSmartSheet\u003c/span\u003e, you might think of designing a set of \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esmart sheets\u003c/span\u003e that work like the documents you (and everyone else in the film music business) are already familiar with, such as spotting notes, timing breakdown, orchestral breakdown, recording session plan, track log, and so on.

Why not use these capabilities to organizing a re-usable infrastructure that supports collaboration between the many people who collaborate on a film music project, including the composer, music editor, film director, assistants, orchestrators, orchestra contractors, recording engineers, conductors, musicians, accountants, and so on?

Inside, you’re instantly presented with the sheets to which you have access rights, and you start working.  It’s pretty intuitive.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLet’s think about the implications of being “in the cloud”.  In the past, if you wanted to use personal computers to construct a distributed collaboratorium involving several individuals, you had to make sure they all had the same software on their computers.  If the collaborators were independent contractors, each would have had to purchase and install his or her own copy of any software needed.  You would have had to ensure that each collaborator owned a sufficiently compatible computer with adequate horsepower.  And then there could be a steep learning curve.  All of these factors would have been expense issues and coordination nightmares – which would have served as a barriers to ever getting the team together and off the ground.  The idea of instant, effortless, low-cost, Internet-enabled collaboration would have been little more than a wistful dream.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut with cloud-based collaboration using \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSmartSheet\u003c/span\u003e, most of these barriers evaporate.  All each collaborator needs is a low-cost laptop or netbook computer capable of running a modern web browser (and it doesn’t have to be the same browser on each individual’s computer).  Mobile device fans can even connect via their smartphones when on the move.  It’s literally true that if you’ve thought through your collaboration and project tracking methodology and have instrumented it in terms of a set of \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esmart sheet\u003c/span\u003e templates, you can choose team members, invite them into your collaboratorium (by means I’ll explain below), and tie them together within a matter of hours or maybe even minutes, with very little learning curve and \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ezero \u003c/span\u003eincremental buy-in cost on the part of invitees.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNotice that these benefits are \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ein addition to\u003c/span\u003e the most basic advantage of \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eany \u003c/span\u003escheme for collaborating over the web:  namely, that the members of your team can be distributed geographically – even across the globe – or, can be in the same room.  This means new flexibility in how you think about team formation and professional relationships.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eThe Benefit Of Sourcing Documents From The Cloud\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLet’s return for a moment to the fact that sharing project documents over the web is central to the way collaboration and project tracking are instrumented when using \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSmartSheet\u003c/span\u003e.  But how does storing these documents in the cloud and sourcing them to team members from the cloud improve sharing?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSharing documents might not seem like such a big deal at first, especially for computer-based documents.  You think,\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003e of course I’m going to share my documents with my team members, just like I always have\u003c/span\u003e.  And then you think:  \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eany time I revise a document, I’ll just send a copy of the updated document file to each team member, right?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere’s a potential problem with this thinking.  If a separate copy of a document resides on each team member’s computer, and the document is subject to change (especially if it can be changed frequently or by more than one person), the possibility arises that different team members can find themselves inadvertently working with \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003edifferent versions\u003c/span\u003e of the document.  In other words, team members can get out of sync with one another.  What could make this happen?  \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eScore changes, \u003c/span\u003eof course!  In today’s film music world, late changes – even up to the last minute – are an increasing risk.  Why?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWell, in the pre-digital age, a much less automated post-production technology meant that late-stage changes to picture or dialog caused unacceptable disruption that could delay final release, with adverse financial impact.  To avoid such disruptions, it used to be that \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003epicture lock\u003c/span\u003e was put into effect far earlier than it is now, relative to the targeted release date.  The lengthy time allowed for post-production let the start of film music work be postponed until picture lock, and thus composers could usually rely on working against stable picture.  But today, computers and digital technologies have drastically accelerated post-production, such that directors can (and often do) keep tweaking their films until much closer to the scheduled release date than before.  In contrast, the process of composing and producing film music \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ehasn’t \u003c/span\u003eaccelerated to the same degree.  The result is that music development is increasingly exposed to late dramatic and timing changes that require cues to be re-worked.  Cue revisions mean that documents supporting the music development process are being changed.  And, as I’ve pointed out, one of the ways a rush of changes can lead to chaos sand lost time is by causing inconsistencies to emerge between the versions of documents that different team members have.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut with \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSmartSheet \u003c/span\u003eand similar cloud-based document-sharing technologies, the idea is that team members \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003edon’t\u003c/span\u003e send copies of documents, revised or otherwise, to one another.  Instead, a \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esingle copy\u003c/span\u003e of each document (a \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esmart sheet\u003c/span\u003e) is stored in the cloud.  All team members work with that single copy – which reflects the latest revision status – within the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSmartSheet \u003c/span\u003eon-line environment.  In this way, the emergence of conflicting document versions is avoided – and with it, the associated chaos.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eEven better – although \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSmartSheet \u003c/span\u003ealways shows you (or any team member) the latest version of a document, it also shows you at a glance \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ewhat’s recently changed\u003c/span\u003e – information that could easily be overlooked with conventional documents.  In addition, SmartSheet transparently maintains a history of \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eall \u003c/span\u003echanges that have been made, as well as when and by whom they were made.  You can access this history for any given \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esmart sheet \u003c/span\u003ecell with a click of the mouse.

However, many or most film music enterprises are probably small enough that there need be only one sheet creator.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo, it all starts with an entrepreneurially-motivated individual – most likely the composer, who is typically at the head of his or her film music enterprise.  That person opens one of several types of paid accounts with \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esmartsheet.com\u003c/span\u003e.  There is a monthly (or annual) fee (as little as $8.50 a month for the most basic account), which entitles the payer to be a sheet creator and provides an \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eallotment of sheets\u003c/span\u003e.
