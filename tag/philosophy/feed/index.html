		<description><![CDATA[You ain't no Williams… and that's not such a bad thing.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>None of us are the same.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll never have to worry about competing with John Williams. I know what you are thinking: &#8220;No kidding, dude!&#8221;</p>
<p>No, I mean it. John Williams will never sound like you can. He&#8217;ll never sound like me. He&#8217;s not able. You might say, &#8220;Um, Deane, excuse me, but John Williams is arguably the single greatest composer living today. He can do anything.&#8221; To which I would respond, &#8220;Yes he is&#8230; and no he cannot.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Williams can never be Deane Ogden, or James Newton Howard, , or John Debney, or Brian Ralston, or Alexandre Desplat, or Sharon Farber, or Chris Young, or Adrian Ellis, or Hans Zimmer, or Brian Satterwhite, or Richard Bellis, or Tim Montijo, or Alan Silvestri. As long as he has written for the screen, as hard as he might try, as much as he may study, he&#8217;ll never get there. Our music flows from a place that John Williams could never understand or even come close to comprehending. He could not possibly get it and he never will.</p>
<p>Conversely, as hard as <em>we</em> try, as hard as <em>we</em> study, and as hard as <em>we</em> practice, <em>we</em> will never sound like John Williams. John Williams never has to worry you nor I. Why? Because none of us could ever fathom what John Williams had to go through to write his most recent note. We will never know the place John Williams writes from. We don&#8217;t <em>get</em> him, and we never ever will.</p>
<p>We are all different people with different lives, different sets of experiences, born of different parents, facing radically different futures. Therefore, <em>competition</em>, at least in the form by which we usually refer to it, doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>People talk about <em>competition</em> all the time. I hear constantly from players how hard it is to compete with the convenience of samples (not the <em>quality</em> of them&#8230;. the <em>convenience</em> of them!). Of course, we all have experienced competition within our own ranks, being put up against each other by our own representative agencies for projects, always with that same reassurance from them, &#8220;Hey don&#8217;t worry… this one&#8217;s got YOU written all over it!&#8221; Uh huh.</p>
<p>Professional golfers say often that there is no competition amongst their tribe, but rather only that which exists between each golfer and the golf course itself. To a pro golfer, the other golfer on the course is not the competitor, but the curve of a fairway or the placement of a hazard. I&#8217;ve always found that concept fascinating and I&#8217;ve often pondered how it might apply to our situation as music and film Creatives. There really is no one entity in the film music community that you need ever have to worry about competing with, save for one&#8230; your own <em>music</em>. Yes, the most fierce competition out there that you&#8217;ll face as a composer is the last score you wrote. Your true nemesis resides right there, in the pit of your own stomach—the drive to better yourself. To set a goal, achieve it, set a loftier goal, achieve that, and so on, and so forth. Creatives have it in their guts to up their own ante. As Creatives, we are our own fiercest competition, our own worst enemies.</p>
<p>Creatives are different than other people. It&#8217;s politically correct to say that we aren&#8217;t—that we are just like construction workers, attorneys, corporate buyers, or police officers—but when you get honest about it, we most certainly AREN&#8217;T like any of those people. We are a different animal. We don&#8217;t think, analyze, opine, or expend our energy the way non-creatives do. We also don&#8217;t rest, work, vacation, engage, or &#8220;unplug&#8221; the way that non-creatives do. We rarely ever stop creating, whether we are writing at our workstations or writing in our heads at the dinner table. We often get accused of not being &#8220;present&#8221; during conversations or engaged in our surroundings (sound familiar?). We daydream a lot. We also have a greater need for solitude and seclusion and often are told that we lean towards being &#8220;reclusive&#8221;. By all counts, we are simply <em>different</em>. And what drives us is different, also.</p>
<p>Creatives are <em>driven</em> in a way that no other human tribe is. We are driven to create, yet in that process of creating—when we are really <em>down in it</em>— composers in particular tend to lose track of something that is vital to long-term success: Self-Improvement. So many composers—even the A-listers who some view as &#8220;leading the pack&#8221; in terms of pushing the boundaries of the craft—rely on their same old bag of tricks, their tried-and-true methods of creating&#8230; the things that have always worked for them. The crutches. The old standards. The &#8220;reliables&#8221;.</p>
<p>It gets worse as you move up the ladder. I recently sat with an A-list composer friend of mine and we talked about the differences between the terraces of the film composing career. We talked about the contrasts of handling 1-2 million dollar studio budgets versus 30-90k indie budgets, managing a team of 25 versus an army of One, and working with our agencies as opposed to negotiating our own deals. But when we started talking <em>creativity</em>, I ask him what the major differences were that he saw between his A-list position and when he first started out as an indie film guy. Here&#8217;s what he said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>&#8220;Deane, when you have done this as long as I&#8217;ve been fortunate to, you develop a sound. And that sound is what you then become known for. Once you have your sound, in a strange way, it&#8217;s over for you creatively. That&#8217;s all they want. That sound. You don&#8217;t get to experiment, they don&#8217;t want you to try anything new. They just want the sound. Then it is up to you. You have to then figure out a way to manipulate that sound—the sound that is YOU—so that it evolves and changes, yet to them, it is still that sound. But to you, it becomes something else. Something different every time. And it&#8217;s always got to be better than the last time, because if it&#8217;s not, then what&#8217;s the point for you? If you aren&#8217;t doing better work each and every time you score a picture, you are cheating yourself and at that point it really is just a service job. It&#8217;s heartless, then. No life. I&#8217;m not saying that&#8217;s easy, Deane. Getting to the point of besting yourself each time out is a hard thing to do, and most composers haven&#8217;t figured out how to do it. But it is possible if you work at it. But that&#8217;s the rub—it takes a lot of patience and a lot of hard work.&#8221;<br />
</em></p>
<h1>The Passion to Be <em>You</em></h1>
<p>Finding your own voice or sound can be daunting at best and impossible at worst. Is it something you can just conjure up, or must it come to you organically, born out of doing film music for long periods of time? Who knows. It&#8217;s probably different for everybody. But certainly, the commonality exists that you must be conscious of it before you set out to be original. In doing so, however, be careful not to set out to be different from everyone else. If you do, you&#8217;ll be looking at others more than you should be. When you focus too much on outside factors, you begin to lose track of what you are trying to accomplish in your own craft.</p>
<p>Exerting effort to be better than the next person will get you nowhere. Well, that&#8217;s not entirely true; it will get you somewhere, but <em>somewhere</em> is a place that you won&#8217;t like very much. Better to concentrate instead on besting yourself. You&#8217;ll never be better than John Williams at what he does. Williams is the best Williams there is. You&#8217;ll never do Tom Newman better than Tom Newman does Tom Newman. I&#8217;m not talking about not having to &#8220;live up&#8221; to the temp, or having to create something with the same vibe as what the director has been infatuated with since the beginning of post. In fact, I believe that &#8220;temp love&#8221; is less about the music and more about the feeling of the scene. (There has never been a situation in my own career when I wasn&#8217;t able to talk the director off the steep cliff of &#8220;recreating the temp&#8221;. It&#8217;s easy to do if you can articulate how the music is not really the issue—the scene is.)</p>
<p>What am I suggesting? Am I saying that competition isn&#8217;t productive? Of course not. What I&#8217;m saying is that competing against <em>yourself</em>, allowing your <em>own</em> brand of greatness to slowly unfold, is better than buzzing harder to keep up with the swarm.</p>
<p>Allow <em>your</em> music to do the talking.</p>

In our 43rd episode, Deane and Brian hold court during a 90-minute discussion with guest composers Panos Kolias and Oliver Sadie on achieving a healthy balance between composing, raising kids, being around for the family and having a life of your own. Also, in a rare unhinging, Deane lets the expletives fly as he collides with Brian over a controversial composing contest that has had the Internet trolls spitting and frothing for weeks. Finally, at the top of the show, David Saunders (Director of Global Community for SCOREcast) announces the details on the new <em>SCOREcast: TORONTO</em> Community Chapter!</p>
<p><strong>WARNING: We believe this episode on family issues and work/life balance to be one of the best in the history of our show. We also realized in editing that it&#8217;s probably our most R-rated. So, consider yourselves warned — we don&#8217;t edit for language. If you have children within earshot, we recommend waiting until you can strap on the cans before listening to this particular episode. Thanks! — D&amp;B</strong></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Your artistic quality has been called into question. And it hurts. Might be true, might not be... but from time to time every artist, no matter the discipline, needs to check the 'ol barometer.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The film music culture over the years has a developed a bit of an elitist complex in the way we talk about the artform, leading some to believe that if you don&#8217;t have little black dots as prevalent as you have red blood cells in your veins then you must not be trying very hard. After all, we were born with this, right? It&#8217;s in our DNA.</p>
<p>Arguable, at best. A lot of people say we were born with certain aptitudes toward this gig but I would argue that while that might be true about musical intuition and a predisposition toward cognitive retention of scales  and other functional repeating mathematical sequences, quality skilled composition only comes out of tireless practice, varied experience and loads of trial and error. It&#8217;s not a far-flung theory then to assume that there could be a serious self-esteem issue working against emerging composers, dare I say even veteran ones who are willing to admit the ugly truth. Are we <em>Weenies</em>? <em>Wimps</em>? <em>Candie-asses</em>? I don&#8217;t think so. But we <em>are</em> human beings and from time to time every artist, no matter the discipline, needs to check the &#8216;ol barometer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>You&#8217;re Not a Bad Composer</h1>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you can&#8217;t seem to write anything today.</strong></h3>
<p>Writer&#8217;s block sucks. But even though the cool thing to say is &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time for that&#8221;, that still doesn&#8217;t mean it never happens. The truth is that it does happen&#8230; to everybody. You aren&#8217;t a bad composer if you are not able to write for whatever reason. You might be a <em>late</em> composer, but you aren&#8217;t a bad one.</p>
<p>How to get rid of it? Studies show that stress is the leading cause of &#8220;mental blocking&#8221; and that eliminating stress-related activities or events in your life can also lower your chances of stalling out creatively. Want to drill down further? Those same studies show that the number one cause of stress, at least among Americans, is <em>finances</em>. If that means something to you&#8230; get on it. Scale back, pare down, save more, spend less, slash and burn, budget hard, charge more — whatever you need to do, but get that financial monkey off your back, and fast. It&#8217;s a killer. Literally.</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you don&#8217;t understand the theories behind music in film.</strong></h3>
<p>It just means you have a few things to learn if you are to be as effective a film music writer as you can be. You might already be an effective composer, but as a film composer you have to intimately understand the marriage of music and drama. If you don&#8217;t, then you are missing a huge piece of the puzzle as a talented composer looking to crack this particular medium. Obviously you aren&#8217;t a bad composer if this skill still eludes you, but I&#8217;ll warn you that without it you are always going to be composing from a <em>defensive</em> posture — meaning that whatever is thrown at you, you&#8217;ll either need to be lucky enough to intuitively feel it and magically hit that bullseye on the first dart throw or you&#8217;ll need to study up every time out, whether that&#8217;s through asking seasoned vets or &#8220;listening&#8221; to seasoned vets via Netflix streaming. Point being, you&#8217;ll always be playing &#8220;catch up&#8221;. That game gets old fast, slows you down, and eventually begins to erode your confidence.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t worry&#8230; it&#8217;s an easy fix. All you have to do is find a way to absorb the principles and theories behind drama. Extended viewing and note-taking can do it, but so will auditing a few film appreciation courses at the local community college. Or reading a stack of good books on the subject. I&#8217;d recommend starting with Earle Hagen&#8217;s <a href="http://amzn.com/0882844474" target="_blank"><em>Advanced Techniques for Film Scoring</em></a>. Hagen&#8217;s book is grossly outdated in its purview of technology, but the score analysis and score/script interaction is second to none. If you really want to steam your head, pick up Fred Karlin&#8217;s classic brick of a book <a href="http://amzn.com/0415941369" target="_blank"><em>On the Track</em></a>. Often referred to as &#8220;the film scoring bible&#8221;, <em>On the Track</em> offers probably the most extensive perspective on various approaches to dramatic writing for the medium of film.</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you&#8217;ve been rejected, fired or ignored. A lot.</strong></h3>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean you suck. Not necessarily, anyway. Although, a case could be made that if you got so far as to pitch for the gig it won&#8217;t matter if you suck anyway because you obviously have what it takes to get through the door. Any well-heeled major player knows <em>that ain&#8217;t easy</em>. But being told that &#8220;your music just isn&#8217;t what we&#8217;re looking for&#8221; is tough. What&#8217;s tougher, though, is hearing that time and again. And even still, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you are a bad composer. You&#8217;ll have to gauge this one for yourself and use your best and most honest evaluations of your output, but there have been plenty of people — hundreds — who&#8217;ve been turned down dozens upon dozens of times before they ever scored a note to picture and even more than that who&#8217;ve been successful and then been told they were washed up, irrelevant, too old, too young, too inexperienced, too expensive, too high-profile, not high-profile enough&#8230; you name it. Point being: Rejection happens and you have to learn to accept it and deal with it appropriately.</p>
<p>There are many ways to face rejection, accept whatever truths come with it, and then discard the parts that don&#8217;t matter. One way is to be sure that you have the most healthy self-esteem you can have outside of your role as a creative person. I married a wonderful woman whom my every heartbeat pounds for. So, I don&#8217;t live every moment to be a composer or to even be a musician. It&#8217;s certainly a gigantic part of who I am at my core, but there are things and people in my life who are more important than any of this will ever be. I&#8217;m not alone in this feeling. Ask anyone who is creative and probably over the age of thirty. The secondary things in life, you realize over time, matter very little. Success takes on a whole new definition when love, children, family, and even the closest friends take root in your life as a middle-aged person. I spend a huge majority of my time trying to hip younger people who are ready to jump off the cliff of career suicide to this fact. When you get rejected, it&#8217;s not a rejection of <em>you as a person</em>, it&#8217;s simply that the timing of your artistic expression and that of the source material don&#8217;t align. That&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s the wrinkle of cosmic scheduling. You could bring the same set of demo cues to the next meeting and have the biggest film in history on your hands. Nobody knows. But whatever the case, rejection should only hit your art, not your heart. It&#8217;s just not worth it and it never ever lasts anyway, so why devote the emotional bandwidth?</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you don&#8217;t know how to read music.</strong></h3>
<p>Clearly, you will be at major and immediate disadvantage if you don&#8217;t read music and you are trying to break into the scene. Not only does this hamper your speed and agility as the point person for the music department on a production, but it will also hurt you as a potential candidate for an apprenticeship — the avenue by which a lot of film composers get their start. Like it or not, and argue all you want, but the film music business still thrives and depends on people who can read dots on a page. Period. Whether you are a musician at a session, an orchestrator sorting out lines for the composer, a copyist handling last-minute changes, or the composer yourself, you will need to read often. Written music comprehension is to a composer what the interpreting of blueprints is to an architect. Not knowing how to read the architectural drawings on the house you are building will be an unmitigated disaster. Imagine being a non-reading composer on the scoring stage and having to quickly change a lead-line for your director, transpose it in your head, and rattle it off to your 1st chair trumpet or clarinetist. Can you imagine? Well, please do&#8230; because that exact scenario is not a rare experience for the in-the-trenches film composer.</p>
<p>Does not reading make you a <em>bad</em> composer? Of course not. Even a few top-tier composers in the game started out just humming their melodies to an orchestrator. But before long, almost all of them learned to read and write at least functionally. Need to brush up? Take some private lessons; there are hundreds of teachers in LA, NYC, and London who will take you on as a private student and bring you up to functional and workable levels in no time. Don&#8217;t be embarrassed by your inability to read notes; not all composers who are working today are ace readers, either, and no matter how good you are, I promise you your musicians will always be ten times better anyway. But even still, having that very basic ability in your skill set will remove what is probably the biggest hurdle to self-confidence as a composer. It is your job as the captain of this ship to have a solid grasp of the fundamentals. This is as fundamental as it gets.</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you don&#8217;t live in a music mecca.</strong></h3>
<p>There you are&#8230; in Delaware. Don&#8217;t worry. Geographical misfortune does not a bad composer make. There&#8217;s been a lot of talk in the last decade about geography and how it correlates to the level of sophistication of a composer, implying that the farther away you are from a major music center the less &#8220;dedicated&#8221; you must be to your craft. Obviously that&#8217;s bullshit. It doesn&#8217;t matter where you live, your talents are your talents. Now, how accessible your talents are to those who need them&#8230; well, that&#8217;s another matter entirely.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re not a <em>bad</em> composer if you live in Cornwall. Still living with the folks in Texarkana? No problem. Never underestimate the powerful combo of a gigabit Internet connection and a fair amount of good old-fashioned hustle. You can accomplish a lot with an IMDbPro account, a well thought-out demo reel and a cell phone. But if you are determined to be in the thick of the film world, the brick and mortar studios are all still standing in Los Angeles. Film and TV seem to be the only industries who haven&#8217;t figured out that the world is flat like the video game industry has. They are making strides in that direction, but they aren&#8217;t there yet. Post-production on films and shows happens in LA.</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; just because somebody says you are.</strong></h3>
<p>Human beings are strange creatures. We love to kick our wounded. I don&#8217;t know what it is, but people will love you when it&#8217;s easy to and hate you when it&#8217;s easier. There is nothing that will take the wind out of your sails more than negative feedback from colleagues. Complete strangers? Whatevs. But colleagues&#8230; That&#8217;s a tough knife in the gut. And there are those out there who are self-loathing enough to let you have it. Believe me. As I&#8217;ve just finished a very personal project, the barbs from the people I figured would lob them last have found their mark. And for a while, I internalized every one, taking it apart and searching for where I&#8217;d gone wrong. But then I realized that those people are not my audience. Do you make music for other musicians? I sure don&#8217;t. So what was I worried about?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: The people who love what you do love it because it does something for them. It fills something in them. It cures what&#8217;s ailing, if only for five minutes. That is your <em>audience</em>. <em>The</em> <em>fans</em>. Not the freaks&#8230; <em>the fans</em>. The freaks are just freaking. They need something to freak about so that they don&#8217;t have to keep staring at their own work. There will be people who &#8220;get&#8221; what you do and there will be people who just don&#8217;t and never will. Just accept that those people aren&#8217;t the people you are doing this for and they likely never will be. Don&#8217;t read your comment feed. Never punch down. Even the biggest stars in entertainment get railed by the folks who are sitting at home doing nothing. If you happen to convert a non-believer through consistent output that ultimately changes their mind, awesome&#8230; You&#8217;re lucky. That doesn&#8217;t happen often. Take great care of them and don&#8217;t abuse their commitment to your art by following up with a piece of crap. But if you never do, remember who you are playing to: <em>Your fans</em>. The dedicated few. Your niche. Your tribe. Your supporters. The people who will join your mailing list, share your content in their social circles, attend your panel discussions, and email occasionally to tell you they &#8220;enjoyed this last one&#8221;. That is the person you are working for. That is where your mental bandwidth deserves allocation. Not thinking about how to <em>get new fans</em>&#8230;. but thinking about how to care for the ones who are here already. That&#8217;s an endgame that matters.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>James Horner once said, &#8220;There are only 12 tones. There&#8217;s only so much you can do.&#8221; Interesting theory, but is it true? Some of you will say that Horner is just lazy. Hmm. Others will say, &#8220;He has a point: Perhaps that&#8217;s why much of the film music we hear today seems a bit derivative.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whichever, his comment raises a pertinent question amongst Creatives: Is there a limit to what can be created from an <em>original</em> place?</p>
<p>Indeed, what constitutes &#8220;originality&#8221;? To take it a step further, what makes for a truly <em>original film score</em>? Is it the sound? The composer? The approach? The use of instruments? Or none of the above&#8230; or ALL of the above? Why do you feel the way you do about your take on it?</p>

Be careful how you answer this one: We are certainly aware of the risk involved in even putting this question out there—we are inviting a deluge of the token <em>&#8220;writing music is who I am&#8221;</em> comments.</p>
<p>If we are honest, though, simply <em>writing</em> is not the primary motivator amongst most who do it everyday. First of all, there are far more easier paths to creative self-realization, and secondly there are far more important things in the overall grand scheme of life itself. After all, if you lost everyone and everything in your life tomorrow, we&#8217;d bet money that the least important &#8220;treasure&#8221; would be all of the shows you&#8217;ve worked on, right?</p>
<p>Some are motivated by the joy of &#8220;making stuff&#8221;, and music just happens to be the conduit by which they are able to do so. Others might be motivated by the fact that they are able to support their family doing such a thing as working in film music, while even others might be driven by the mere fact that they don&#8217;t know how to do anything else! Then again, maybe you just like to&#8230;oh, I don&#8217;t know&#8230; EAT.</p>
<p>There are hundreds, if not millions, of potentially motivating factors involved in choosing a career in film music. And so, we ask YOU: What <em>TRULY</em> motivates you to continue on in this tough business? Yeah, yeah, yeah&#8230; we get it—<em>you were &#8220;made to do this!&#8221;</em> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But what is it that <em>REALLY</em> keeps you coming back time and time again to have another go, frame after frame, note after note, film after film?</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../2010/08/deane-ogden-caveats-of-convenient-film-composing-pt-1.html" target="_blank">Caveats of Convenience: Part I</a></li>
</ul>
<p>[/slidingnote]</p>
<p>While we often love to talk about what we do right most of the time, these few posts speak instead to some things that I’ve observed film composers doing <em>wrong</em> lately. Of course, that statement in and of itself is highly subjective, but I think there are some habits that are starting to trend that, while possibly not evident right away, will prove down the line to be detrimental to doing business as a film composer in our continually evolving market. I see this list of choices as “temptations of convenience”, and this series might also be called “The Seduction of the Easy Way Out”. In this economy and composing climate, I see a lot of composers taking these routes and while none of them are necessarily “bad”, I’ll try to make the case as to why I believe most of them should be avoided.</p>
<h3>Caveat #2: Fame</h3>
<p>I was at my manager&#8217;s birthday party a few weeks ago and was asked by someone who read my first installment in this series, &#8220;Why did you say, <em>&#8216;You&#8217;ll never become famous being a film composer?&#8217; </em>That&#8217;s not true. There are several people who have become famous composing for films.” This person went on to cite several people who we might all agree could be considered famous in our field: John WIlliams, Jerry Goldsmith, James Horner, and more recently—Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard.</p>
<p>While I would agree that each of those people—and more—are quite famous within the circles of film music, I would not be too quick to say that they are famous as we would define fame within our society&#8217;s immediate cultural definition of the term. For example, ask a person &#8220;Who is Michael Jackson?&#8221; and nine times out of ten you&#8217;ll hear, &#8220;He was the King of Pop.&#8221; Ask the same ten people &#8220;Who is John Williams?&#8221; and I&#8217;m not sure nine of them—or even <em>five</em> of them—would have any answer at the ready. A few may know, while others may only know if you hum a few bars of the &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; theme or the &#8220;Raiders March&#8221;, but the majority would have no clue. This is not to say that Williams isn&#8217;t every bit as influential on the modern landscape of American music. He most certainly has been. But with all due respect to &#8220;the Maestro&#8221;, the truth is that Michael Jackson and John Williams are worlds apart in the &#8220;fame&#8221; department.</p>
<p>In fact, the more I think about this question posed to me by this gentleman at the party, the more I stand behind my statement. First and foremost, “fame”, as defined by Webster&#8217;s, is “the state or quality of being widely honored and acclaimed.” I think we can all agree that by this definition, we as film composers—should we ever attain any great heights of fame and fortune—would be in the minority on this one. Michael Jackson; Michael Jordan; Michael Douglas… hell, Michael LOHAN (ugh!)—I hate to burst any bubbles, but film composers don&#8217;t even register as a blip on the radar screen of <em>that</em> kind of fame.</p>
<p>Secondly, I believe that if the impetus behind your drive to score films is <em>fame</em>, you are missing the point entirely. Maybe I should have said, &#8220;If you <em>want</em> to be famous, don&#8217;t be a composer.&#8221; Maybe that would have made the difference for my friend? I don&#8217;t know. What I <em>do</em> know is that although John Williams ended up being famous doing what he did, I&#8217;d bet money he never intended to write music for the purpose of “getting famous&#8221;. And <em>that’s</em> where I hope people are not headed as they choose to embark on their odyssey in film music. Like anything you put your hand to in life, you have to do it for the love of it, or you are doing it in vain. Period.</p>
<p><strong>The Difference Between <em>Fame </em>and <em>Greatness</em></strong><br />
I&#8217;ve made it a priority in my career to mentor a certain number of film music students during each cycle of work here at the Musicave. One recent student kept using the word &#8220;famous&#8221; every time we would talk about his career goals in our times together. I once asked him at what level a composer would need to be at in order to be free to pick and choose projects as they saw fit. &#8220;After you are <em>famous</em>,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;then you can do whatever you want. Until you get <em>famous</em>, you have to take anything you can get to build your career.&#8221; His choice to constantly use that word&#8230; &#8220;famous&#8221;&#8230; it grated on me like fingernails on a chalkboard. I finally confronted him about it. Susie and I took him to dinner and I told him, &#8220;Dude, we need to talk about something you have been saying that&#8217;s been nagging at me for a few days. This &#8216;getting famous&#8217; thing of yours&#8230; first of all, you are dreaming. That&#8217;s Number 1. Number 2, it&#8217;s just the wrong motivation for wanting to be in film music. No director gives a damn about your desire to &#8216;be famous&#8217;&#8230; they want to know if you love the story enough to give it your all&#8230; FOR THE FILM. It&#8217;s never about YOU. It&#8217;s always about the project.&#8221;</p>
<p>As we talked, the real problem came out. This poor kid has been told all his life that he&#8217;ll &#8220;never do anything <em>great</em>&#8220;. He&#8217;s been put down, stomped on, made to feel inferior, and basically just had every ounce of esteem kicked out of him by the very people who should have been supporting him the most. It became clear to me that this young man equated &#8220;fame&#8221; with &#8220;greatness&#8221;. In his mind, the best way to show those unbelieving people in his life that he was worth believing in was to become &#8220;famous&#8221; doing what they told him he could never and would never do <em>well</em>. Once I helped him identify the real problem, we were then able to have an important conversation about the vast difference between being <em>great</em> and being <em>famous</em>. For him, the delineation of those two ideas was a paradigm shift that he really needed to have if he was to ever stand a chance at this career. Maybe even at life in general.</p>
<p>The sad truth is that many of our graduating film music students are just like this young man once was. They do not understand the difference between <em>being great</em> and <em>being famous</em>. And how could they? Our culture glorifies <em>fame</em>, but places very little value on <em>greatness</em>. They&#8217;ve confused the two, thus sending young people on a wild goose chase to find this brass ring of &#8220;fame&#8221;. Think about this: How many people in your life were extremely popular (famous) but just really not that great of a person? See what I mean? It is a pathetic trend in our society that needs to seriously level off should we hope to extend any nobility to the next generation of film music innovators, or our children in general. There is an entire legion of aspiring composers entering the fold who simply want to be famous or make lots of money. There really are. If you don&#8217;t believe me, spend some time on the campus at some of our finer music schools. I have, and I&#8217;ve seen it with my own eyes and heard with my own ears. Ambition, to these misguided young minds, is simply a commodity to be bought and sold like stocks or widgets. It is something attainable by having as many Twitter followers as Justin Beiber or by having 30 or 40 comments on your Facebook statuses. These kids have seen too many episodes of &#8220;Entourage&#8221;—they&#8217;ve convinced themselves that the way to the top of the film music heap is by becoming the compositional version of &#8220;Vinnie Chase&#8221;. All they need is their &#8220;Ari&#8221; to help them get there.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fame</em> is not Enough</strong><br />
I wish I could stand in front of every film music student enrolled today and tell them that the desire for fame is not a valid reason for doing ANYTHING. To truly get all you can get out of something—in our case, film music—you must simply be in love with the mere act of doing it. Nothing more. I&#8217;m not even talking &#8220;results&#8221;, yet&#8230; I&#8217;m just talking about the <em>action</em> of it. It&#8217;s the <em>action</em> that must consume you. Writing film music must be critical to your very existence. You should love it so much that you go to sleep thinking about how you really should get up and do more of it, and you should be waking up in the morning already late to get back to doing it. The very process must be your only motivation, your every reason, and your insatiable drive for needing to do it some more. It has to be that one thing that you do, that were you ever not able to do it anymore, you would honestly cease to be complete in some unexplainable way—a vital component to your human contentment would be absent&#8230; and that vast expanse would not be a void that could be filled with dollars, fame, notoriety, or accolades. It would be a &#8220;music-shaped hole&#8221; that only writing music could fill again.</p>
<p>Fame doesn&#8217;t do any of that. Fame is a state of <em>being</em>, not a state of <em>process </em>or<em> an action</em>. Fame is not a <em>choice</em>. Fame is something that happens <em>to</em> you, not something you<em> make</em> happen. <em>Fame</em> relies on luck and chance, while <em>greatness</em> relies on consistency of character. Serenity, contentment, balance, and harmony—these are the motivating mechanisms that propel people toward <em>greatness</em>. In this light then, <em>fame</em>, it seems, is simply not enough.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am attending a film festival this week in LA to promote a film that I recently scored called &#8220;In the Eyes of a Killer&#8221; with my director <a class="zem_slink" title="Louis Mandylor" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0541909/" rel="imdb">Louis Mandylor</a>. I have met a grip of great people at this fest and have seen many great films, all by talented filmmakers that at one time or another&#8230; needed film composers!! (Hint hint, nudge nudge, wink wink&#8230; Get out there and network!!)</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SnAE8tPWRzI/AAAAAAAAAes/rMGGjzAAj8Y/s1600-h/photo.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SnAE8tPWRzI/AAAAAAAAAes/rMGGjzAAj8Y/s320/photo.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a></div>
<p>In a conversation with a group of directors and producers yesterday, the talk turned to <em>producing movies</em>. One of them said, &#8220;Deane, why don&#8217;t you produce in addition to compose? You are a such a good producer&#8230; you should just do it as another career.&#8221;</p>
<p>I fumbled through some sort of answer like, &#8220;Aw shucks, guys&#8230; I just cannot think of anything I&#8217;d rather do than compose.&#8221; With a little more chiding and a little more dodging from me, they were finally satisfied and we changed the topic.</p>
<p>The more I thought about it throughout the day, however, the more that situation showed its true colors as a glaring example of what my dad often refers to as &#8220;good being the enemy of great&#8221;.</p>
<p>The truth is, I <strong><em>am</em></strong> a good producer. I have an incredibly solid sense of film and I know how to tell a story, and tell it well. I&#8217;ve been offered producer credits several times on films that I&#8217;ve been hired to score simply because I&#8217;ve talked directors, editors, and producers into doing things that they never would have done had someone like me not pitched them on it. But in the end, producing neither interests me or is what I am 100% passionate about. I am passionate about one thing, and one thing only: Scoring the film.</p>
<p>Here is the lesson in this for me: <em>Being &#8220;good&#8221; at something doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you should do it.</em> I&#8217;m a decent orchestrator, but I would much rather hire people like Brian Satterwhite or Susie Benchasil that are &#8220;great&#8221; at it. I can sit down and copy parts for the orchestra, but my attention to detail in that department is not anywhere in the same ball-park as someone like Steven Julliani&#8217;s. I&#8217;m also quite handy with a hammer and can keep a poker face like nobody&#8217;s business, but I&#8217;m not a housing contractor or a world-championship card shark, either!</p>
<p>Furthermore, I feel like since I am a solid businessman (which is what it takes to be a killer producer), I&#8217;d almost be playing it <em>safe</em> if I was to choose that career over this one. The honest truth is that when you are passionate about something, you are willing to risk it all to make it happen, and I&#8217;m not passionate about <em>producing</em>. Therefore, it would be a &#8220;sleepwalking&#8221; job for me that I know I wouldn&#8217;t throw my heart and soul into on a daily basis. I would be one of those cautionary tales you here about at cocktail parties where &#8220;Yeah, Deane is a great producer, but man&#8230; the lights are on but there&#8217;s nobody home anymore.&#8221; Not good.</p>
<p>Yet, I see it all the time&#8230; people in careers that are unfulfilling to them, and when called on the carpet for it, the answer is one that most often has to do with <em>security</em> and <em>safety</em>. The problem is that nobody gets anywhere by playing it safe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good&#8221; is safe, but &#8220;great&#8221; is fulfilling. I left a very financially safe career playing drums in the pop music world to do what I&#8217;ve always wanted to do. Now I have a great life that I wouldn&#8217;t trade for anything, and I&#8217;ve often said that I&#8217;d rather be homeless and living in a box if I still got to score films than be rich beyond belief in a job doing anything but.</p>
<p>So the challenge is this: If you <em>aren&#8217;t</em> doing what you are passionate about&#8230; why not? What&#8217;s the matter? Maybe it&#8217;s what people have told you you&#8217;re good at. Have you ever thought about that? People always seem to know what <em>you</em> should be doing with <em>yourself</em>. I hate that. It&#8217;s like &#8220;Live your own life and let me do <em>my</em> thing, will ya!&#8221; If you listen to what people say you ought to be when you grow up, then guess what? You&#8217;ll be old and fat and have a nice house and drive a nice car but still be miserable as hell. Any questions?</p>
<p>Maybe you are <em>afraid</em> of something. Are you <em>scared</em> that things might not be the way they are now&#8230; all nice and safe and secure&#8230; if you were to begin doing what you were made to do? It&#8217;s okay if you are&#8230; we have all been afraid at some point. That is a natural human response to a very realistic dilemma, and nobody can or should fault you for it. But, you have to move past it and you have to overcome that fear, otherwise it will keep you from doing what truly brings you the most joy in your life.</p>
<p>Now, go write some kick-ass music for something&#8230; you know&#8230; the kind only <strong><em>you</em></strong> can write!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of the time when talking about the topic of &#8220;diversification&#8221; as film composers, we are referring to the skills necessary to write for a variety of different mediums, genres, or projects. I&#8217;d like to talk about diversifying in a different light &#8211; being a diverse <span style="font-style: italic;">collaborator</span>.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Diverse collaboration</span> to me means that in this process of filmmaking you are a <span style="font-style: italic;">solution</span>, not a <span style="font-style: italic;">problem</span>. It means possessing the skillset to creatively and intuitively behave your team <span style="font-style: italic;">out</span> of the tight spots that others might have behaved your team <span style="font-style: italic;">in</span> to. It doesn&#8217;t just mean that you can write great music for any number of situations or scenes, but also that you are solid in a room, you know how to treat people, you know your gear, and that you follow through on tasks delegated to you. In fact, your diversity as a collaborator might be one of the greatest assets you can provide a director who has hired you to score his or her film.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not always easy – diversity and flexibility as a collaborator can be tough. You have to be on your toes as much as on your guard. In the post-production process, schedules are tight and claustrophobic which tends to create tension and sometimes friction amongst those being held responsible to pull off a miracle at the eleventh hour. I have found that in times like these, when directors are almost always already on the edge of insanity, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Whatever you can do at this point insure a smoother ride for them, do <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span>.</p>
<p>There are some simple work habits that have helped me collaborate well with people over the years. Each of these suggestions are basic yet important fundamentals that I&#8217;ve held fast to and tried not to deviate from. This list is itself a diverse one – some of these ideas are technical, while others are philosophical in nature. Each of them, however, has played an important role in my business, guarantying a smooth working collaboration every time.</p>
<p>In this, my first &#8220;Tao&#8221; column, I&#8217;ll attempt to define some of them, and then I wanna hear yours!</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">NEVER play a director a cue that you don&#8217;t really love.</span><br />
These are in no particular order, but this might be the most important one in the bunch. I&#8217;ve done it both ways in my career- I&#8217;ve submitted something I thought was absolutely perfect for the scene, and then on one particular occasion, I thought I&#8217;d be &#8220;smart&#8221; and submit two things: one that I thought was perfect, and one that I thought was lame and would most assuredly guarantee that the director choose the first one. Yep&#8230;you guessed it. The director chose the lame one, and I was forced to run with it. Now every time I hear that cue in that particular movie, I cringe. NEVER ever ever ever play the director a cue that you aren&#8217;t 200% in love with.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Demo in as much detail as possible.</span><br />
&#8220;The more you show, the more you&#8217;ll know.&#8221; – Christopher Young.<br />
Directors don&#8217;t speak &#8220;music&#8221;. It is up to you to utilize your mock-ups to determine what it is that they like about what they are hearing, as much as what they don&#8217;t like about it. Ask a lot of questions. Upon them saying, &#8220;Yeah, that just doesn&#8217;t work for me&#8221;, find out &#8220;Why&#8221;. Is it an instrument they don&#8217;t like, or an entire melody line? The former is easy to fix, the latter&#8230; not so much. More often than not, less is more in a film score so the more color you add to your mock-ups (assuming your thematic material has already been approved), the more opportunity there is to strip away layers until they finally hear what they like.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Save EVERY version of EVERY cue.</span><br />
I&#8217;ll never forget one time while working on a pivotal cue for an action scene, I saved what I thought was the best version of the cue that I had come up with yet. The problem was that I saved it over the top of the prior version. But that&#8217;s okay, cuz this one was better, right?! I played the cue for the director, and he confirmed what I had told myself would never happen in a million years: &#8220;Yeah that&#8217;s cool, but I liked the last one better! It had something this one doesn&#8217;t.&#8221; FRICK! Moral of the story? Save every damn thing you do. You never know what is going to catch their ear and what isn&#8217;t, even if you think you know.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Find out who the boss is, and deal only with them.</span><br />
Never accept a job where a committee of 10 people must approve each cue revision. You&#8217;ll end up taking a great score and turning it into a giant pile of crap trying to please a committee. If I&#8217;ve said it once, I&#8217;ve said it a thousand times: &#8220;Approval by committee never ever works!&#8221; Find out who the decision maker is and work ONLY with them. If there is no single decision maker (Hint: its usually the director), then don&#8217;t accept the job. You&#8217;ll thank yourself for it later. That said, there are exceptions to every rule. On &#8220;The Way Home&#8221;, I had two decision makers – the director AND the producer – but they functioned as one. If one of them approved something, it was understood by all that I had my &#8220;final approval&#8221;. This worked flawlessly, and given the time pressure of our deadline, it HAD to.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Triple check your mixes against dialog and FX.</span><br />
You aren&#8217;t the only contractor working on the project at this stage in the game. Make sure you are communicating with all department heads, ie. mix engineer, lead foley artist, dialog editors, etc. Check your mixes against the scenes &#8211; never skip this step, even if you are in a rush. There&#8217;s nothing worse than getting to a dub and having to concede that your music be buried in the mix because it conflicts with more important elements in the film. And remember &#8211; Dialog will take priority every time. No exceptions. Never try to compete with it. You&#8217;ll simply lose that battle.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Give the film YOUR voice. Try to avoid trends and gimmicks.<br />
</span> An original score is a huge investment in trust and belief in you by your employers. Creating a trendy/gimmicky score will result in it sounding outdated and cheap in two years. Your director/producers deserve more and have paid the price to bring you in. Don&#8217;t skimp by simply stringing something together using the latest loops and plugins that every single other composer is using. Be original and come up with something that will &#8220;brand&#8221; their movie in people&#8217;s ears and minds, and never ever be afraid to inject your personality into your scores. After all, they hired YOU for a reason.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Create simple motifs and themes.</span><br />
Don&#8217;t get too complex with your themes and motifs. Don&#8217;t use more than two or three themes or two or three motifs to identify those themes. Even the heaviest symphonic scores are simple in their effectiveness. John Williams is the obvious master of this tactic. Listen to how he brilliantly reuses motivic ideas throughout his entire score, never deviating far from the original theme or idea. A score that is too complex serves to do nothing but dilute the storyline and take the viewers attention off of where it should be.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Create &#8220;threads&#8221;.</span><br />
Building on my last point, I like to think of the score as a big quilt that wraps itself around a film. The &#8220;quilt&#8221; (score) is made up of dozens of &#8220;blocks&#8221; (cues) and each block has within it several &#8220;threads&#8221; that associate each block with the rest of the quilt. Once you have a theme that supports the film well, check to see if there&#8217;s a way to use only one line of the theme in other themes to help &#8220;thread&#8221; the score together. In your film score, there are all kinds of ways to &#8220;state a theme&#8221; without really stating it within the context of its original useage. Additionally, the &#8220;thread&#8221; can also be the use of some sort of instrument that lends identity to the score. Think of what Mark Isham did in &#8220;Crash&#8221; with a female solo voice juxtaposed against a thick liquidy wash of synthesizers. &#8220;Threads&#8221; are everything in helping to give the film a musical identity.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Think big.</span><br />
As an independent film composer, by the time the producers are ready for your music, there is not much room left in the budget. Yet, the everyone has met and its unanimous: Real instruments &#8211; maybe even a large orchestra &#8220;would sound amazing on this film!&#8221; Well, yes, that might be true, but the reality is that you can&#8217;t get something for nothing. Or can you? Online networking has opened up so many more possibilities that weren&#8217;t there even a year ago, and the reality is that in today&#8217;s technological age, it IS possible to get together a group of people who would love nothing more than to get their names on something that Hollywood is up to. So think big. Don&#8217;t let the &#8220;budget&#8221; paint you into a corner that really doesn&#8217;t exist. Many times I&#8217;ve recorded a decent orchestra on a shoe-string budget for a film that, in my opinion as the composer, really needed an orchestral sound. It is always worth turning over every rock and calling in every marker to get something bigger than everyone thinks is even possible when people are looking to you to deliver something amazing. So, go on, be the hero and save the day! You&#8217;ll get hired again by giving more than you are being asked to give. Everyone wants someone like that on their team.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Over Communicate.</span><br />
Okay&#8230; forget #1! THIS might be the most important one of the bunch! Dale Carnegie said, &#8220;The worst thing you can do in business is leave people to their own wondering.&#8221; So true. You can never communicate too much. It&#8217;s impossible. Find out how your client likes to communicate, whether by email, phone, fax, iChat, whatever&#8230; and DO IT TO DEATH! Tell them everytime you revise something, rewrite something, notice something in the picture that you didn&#8217;t notice before&#8230; anything to help them understand that you are working hard for them and doing what they&#8217;ve asked you to do (and sometimes what they HAVEN&#8217;T asked you to do!). NEVER let your creative team not hear from you in days. That&#8217;s the cardinal sin. The score is likely the first time that the creative team has let go of the project to an outside independent creative talent like yourself, and they need reassurance that you are not killing the &#8220;baby&#8221; they just spent the last two years of their life carrying.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes, part of being <span style="font-style: italic;">diverse</span> means being flexible and ready to do whatever it takes. The job of a film composer is one of service to the director and service to the film itself. We cannot afford to be unbendable or unteachable in our careers. Being diverse in how you handle situations and flexible in how you handle stress and obstacles is vital to your success in this business. Some of it will come with time and learning the hard way, but most of it can come with common sense and solid planning.</p>
<p>This is <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">my</span> list &#8211; if you have a few of your own, I&#8217;d love to hear them!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Before diving headlong into an analytical frenzy surrounding the functions of film music, one must begin by establishing a frame of reference by which the very existence of film music centers. In doing that one must not immediately look at specific moments in film that are supported by music but rather moments which are not.</div>
<p>Silence (or non-scored scenes) in film is a beautiful thing. I have a knack for confusing people by saying that even as a film composer, there is nothing I love more than film that works perfectly without music. There&#8217;s an ingrained sense of cinematic perfection when it achieves its narrative goals without the aid of music. These moments contain something that music could never offer&#8230;complete and total silence (by that I&#8217;m still acknowledging the existence of dialogue and sound effects).</p>
<p>If we are to believe that music is an ingredient that when added to a particular scene helps achieve a variety of narrative goals then one might reasonably deduce that perhaps that scene is flawed in some way. Is this true? If the scene needs help by employing music does that make it an inferior scene to one that is successful wholly on its own?</p>
<p>These are rhetorical questions that don&#8217;t necessarily need answering. Because of the extreme variation in cinematic storytelling and the many obstacles contained therein there is no definitive answer. However, I pose the question merely to get your brain tuned to the frequency of judging silence vs. scoring. I think the art of spotting a film (deciding where music should go in a movie) is dying. Gone are the days where I&#8217;m noticing clever choices in spotting which used to be frequently exhibited by composers like Bernard Herrmann, Miklós Rózsa, and perhaps the best spotter of them all&#8230;Jerry Goldsmith. Their creative decisions on where to put music (or more importantly, where <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> to put music) vastly effected the overall success and quality of their scores and ultimately their respective films.</p>
<p>For example, let&#8217;s look at a classic scene in NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959) directed by Alfred Hitchcock. There is a moment where Roger Thornhill (played by Cary Grant) ascends upon a lone crossroads in the middle of nowhere to await instruction from his unknown mystery source. He stands there patiently&#8230;waiting. The scene is unusually long and not much, if anything, really happens. A car drives by, a man appears and waits, a bus passes&#8230;all benign, boring, and without a clue of justification.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1267" title="north_by_northwest" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/north_by_northwest-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/north_by_northwest-640x360.jpg 640w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/north_by_northwest-389x218.jpg 389w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>So how does the master, Bernard Herrmann, decide to score benign and boring? He doesn&#8217;t. The scene, in its entirety, is left completely unscored. Why? Isn&#8217;t Herrmann worried about losing at least part of the audience here? It&#8217;s a valid concern.</p>
<p>This entire scene is about perpetuating one question&#8230;<span style="font-style: italic;">What the hell is going on?</span> Roger is internally asking it to himself. We, as the audience, are asking this of ourselves as we experience this along with him. It&#8217;s the &#8220;elephant-in-the-room&#8221; of this scene. There isn&#8217;t a note of music Herrmann could have written that could better express the awkwardness of the moment better than silence. It&#8217;s the inherent function of silence that works so utterly beautifully here. Moments later the scene is thrust into overdrive as Roger is peculiarly attacked by a nearby crop-dusting biplane. Again the question accelerates and perpetuates&#8230;&#8221;What the hell is going on?&#8221; It isn&#8217;t until the scene is completely over and the crop duster plows into the side of a tanker truck that Herrmann finally enters the music.</p>
<p>As many times as I&#8217;ve seen this scene, I often wonder if it were made today how many composers would automatically score this scene. I think a high percentage of them probably would. It&#8217;s a powerful lesson more composers should heed.</p>
<p>Silence is a powerful thing&#8230;and as an added benefit, it&#8217;s far less work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/05/sig-satterwhite.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-740" title="sig-satterwhite" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/05/sig-satterwhite.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>Deane just wrote an interesting article about procrastination that I think is a valuable lesson for anybody working under pressure deadline situations. I also agree that procrastination is erroneously looked upon as a negative thing nearly all the time.</p>
<p>Even under the most common definitions I&#8217;m not too terribly guilty of procrastination or &#8220;wasting time.&#8221; That doesn&#8217;t mean I push things off or delay starts or anything like that. In fact, procrastination for me is a major step in the creative process. It&#8217;s the moment to cleanse the palette and purge the creative process of any undesirables. It&#8217;s a moment for planning and just keeping things fun. Eventually when the that phase is over you&#8217;ll need to make that transition effectively or else risk losing valuable time in your schedule. That is when procrastination <span style="font-style: italic;">does</span> become a liability.</p>
<p>Even working with Deane on his latest project the fact we had to pull an all-nighter to get the scores and parts done before an 11AM recording session wasn&#8217;t that big of a deal for me. My wife knows, my kids know, my friends know&#8230;when it&#8217;s deadline time they won&#8217;t see me and I&#8217;m probably not sleeping. That&#8217;s just a fact of the business. There&#8217;s no such thing as finishing early. In fact, there is the old saying &#8220;you never really finish you just run out of time.&#8221; That&#8217;s pretty much true.</p>
<p>Even though I may spend a week or ten days &#8220;procrastinating&#8221; on a big scoring project I look back when it&#8217;s all said and done and realize that planned time at the start of production was essential to me reaching the finish line. I feel like I maximized my time on nearly everything I&#8217;ve done. That&#8217;s just the way the old ball bounces.</p>
<p>Good topic Deane&#8230;</p>
