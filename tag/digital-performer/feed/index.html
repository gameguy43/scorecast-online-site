<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">For me being a recording engineer and having to appeal to a wide variety of people means that I need to stay competitive in my gear selection, my rates, my marketing, and my best practices. I can no longer afford just try to compete on my talent or skill alone. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><a name="more"></a></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">The market branding of technology has both helped and hurt us in this regard. If I say, &#8220;ProTools&#8221;, you know exactly what I’m talking about and you probably know that it is the defacto standard in most recording studios, post houses, and professional dubbing stages. While there is always a 2nd competitor lurking in the wings, for the most part ProTools is the king. This is not a debate of whether Digital Performer (my DAW) is better or can do the same thing as ProTools, but it’s simply the expectation that this is what you are required to have.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">I had someone recently stop by my studio to chat about music and a future recording project. He looked at all of my vintage gear and mic pre-amps. Then, without even hesitating, he said, “So you have Pro Tools right?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Now, I don’t have a full blown HD system. I have an LE system that I bought for the purpose of being able to open and import other clients PT sessions, but I do not use it as my main DAW. Trying to remain competitive, for a brief moment, I had to put on my selling hat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">&#8220;While I do have Pro Tools, I use DP to record everything you need recorded!&#8221; </span></p>
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">After spending all my money on my gear, I didn’t like the feeling of having to justify myself, but the potentially of having the client leave and go somewhere else solely based on me not having Pro Tools would have been catastrophic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">But by illustration, this is how a competitor could take business from me. A potential client could go elsewhere simply because I don’t have the right microphone or the right compressor. I have had this happen. Again, not because what I had was junk, but someone told someone, who told someone, who read it on the latest audio blog that you have to use a Neve pre amp and an SSL to mix on.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">I still have not fully embraced the ProTools regime. Call me a rebel, but this could affect me, or even my chance to go work at another studio. Even if I have over 20 years of recording experience could I get overlooked if I don’t know ProTools? Maybe…</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">So&#8230; do you need more gear, the latest sound library, monitors, or microphone to remain competitive? The answer is that it depends on what your goal is. Think about what you do and what you have to offer from a talent, skill, or business perspective. Weigh the pros and cons of any financial or potential gear purchase. Could this new technology help you? If 9 out of 10 clients keep asking for a specific drum program, it may be worth investing in. If you need something versus wanting something that may in fact make you more competitive, then by all means, carry on my wayward son!</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">For me, it’s a struggle of trying to keep a certain standard in my own mind as far as a service that I provide, versus the kid in his basement charging $15 dollars/hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">What about you? Hit me back in the <strong>COMMENTS</strong> below and let&#8217;s talk this through. Is the assumption that certain technologies are a must important to the issue of strong competition? Is it even worth competing if your set-up does not contain a certain &#8220;level&#8221; of string library or a particular piece of EQ software? </span></p>
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">And now&#8230; off to buy the new Neve and an SSL!</span></p>

Here are the three that Lee Sanders chose, and a short rundown on why he picked them.</em><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Digital Performer</strong><br />
I imagine a lot of us will include our sequencing app on this list—and that&#8217;s probably appropriate. If you write music at the computer, your sequencing platform informs everything else you do. Its importance is paramount. It has to be solid, flexible, and powerful… and above all, it has to serve any need you might conceivably have in your composing life. Digital Performer delivers for me on all counts.</p>
<p>For me this application has, over the years, become a transparent filter. I&#8217;ve worked with it for thousands—tens of thousands—of hours, and my fingers just know where to go. If you&#8217;re a user of Logic, Cubase or any of the other major platforms out there, you may have the same feeling about your work canvas… at some point it&#8217;s just a matter of what you &#8220;grew up&#8221; using. For me, it&#8217;s Digital Performer—since 1989, when it was plain old Performer. For twenty years and counting, and I don&#8217;t see myself switching anytime soon.</p>
<p><strong>Omnisphere</strong><br />
On the other hand, Omnisphere is one of the newest additions to my arsenal, and it&#8217;s just a sick powerhouse of a sound module. The variety and sound quality of what you&#8217;ll find here is unparalleled, in my experience… and the playability and &#8220;inspiration&#8221; factor are downright dangerous. I&#8217;ve caught myself spending hours on end in enjoyable tone patrol, just seeing what this monster can do. And when you add the processing capabilities they&#8217;ve added onto this beast, the entire thing steps up yet another level. Seriously… it&#8217;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not nearly done scratching the surface of what Omnisphere will bring to my writing. I&#8217;d sum it up this way: sometimes you buy a new piece of gear because of its range: it does many things you need (or that you discover you need once you&#8217;ve made the purchase). Other gear you buy because it does one thing incredibly well. Omnisphere gives you both these functions… and that&#8217;s just plain wrong. Spectrasonics is a company of absolute lunatics for letting this thing go at the current price point. There. I said it.</p>
<p><strong>M-Audio keyboards</strong> (Keystation Pro 88 et al.)<br />
For me there are two camps of controllers: the Really Expensive, Really Nice Controller, and the Really Cheap, Readily Replaceable Controller. If you have true keyboard chops, you probably want to purchase the former and keep it around for a long, long time. The exquisite action of the hammers… the glorious reproduction of an actual piano &#8220;feel&#8221;… all these things make a difference to you.</p>
<p>Me, I&#8217;m a hack. I can play just well enough to enter the information in when I&#8217;m sequencing… and that&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s simply not a skill I&#8217;ve developed. Fully-weighted keyboards actually make my hands ache after a few hours of hard sequencing. So I buy a new, cheap, semi-weighted keyboard controller every year or two, and I just abuse that sucker. Inevitably it bites the dust, and I buy a new one. But that&#8217;s a strategy that works for me. And M-Audio offers lots of bells and whistles on their 88-key range (and I&#8217;d recommend 88 keys for you—if you haven&#8217;t worked with the full 88, you honestly don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re missing!), at a price that makes it possible for me to get by with my (lack of) performance technique. Problem… solution. Simple.</p>
<p>(P.S. I&#8217;d include my trusty Mac Pro on this list, but A) someone else is almost sure to do so, and B) Digital Performer is a Mac-only product, so I&#8217;m sort of able to cheat and include it by default—!)</p>

You probably have heard of a few models from Mackie including the Mackie Control, and the HUI. <a href="http://presonus.com/">Presonus </a>and <a href="http://frontierdesign.com/">Frontier Design</a> have entered the market with a single fader unit, and if you’re Houston Haynes you already use the <a href="http://www.smartav.net/tango/index.php">SmartAV Tango</a> controller. <a href="http://euphonix.com/">Euphonix</a> has also come out with two lower cost versions of their higher-end controllers, the System 5 and MC Pro. These lower cost versions, the MC Mix and MC Control offer a great deal of features for the price.</p>
<div class="MsoNormal">DAW controllers have been around for a few years now, but have increased in visibility more and more in project studios and composing rigs.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">So, what <em>is</em> a DAW Remote Controller? As we started mixing more in the box, the desire to have more analog style faders to mix increased. Using a mouse became a pain for people used to using a real mixing console. Being able to mix via larger sized faders versus using the mouse became a necessity. Also the ability to control the transport functions (start, stop, record) and even control and automate parameters of plugins, enables you to improve your workflow. With that in mind, manufactures started  producing these remote controllers that look like some kind of audio mixer but does not pass any audio. They offer various controls for your DAW parameters and transport functions giving you the simplicity of mixing in the box, the control of a stand-alone <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f800000000015377a" title="Mixing console" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixing_console">mixing board</a>, and the flexibility of the computer.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">These controllers use various protocols to communicate. Mackie Control and HUI are the most common, as well as proprietary protocols such as Euphonix’s Eucon. These run over <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f80000000000282fe" title="Musical Instrument Digital Interface" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_Instrument_Digital_Interface">MIDI</a>, <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f800000000003ed6d" title="Universal Serial Bus" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus">USB</a> and <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f80000000000149d0" title="Ethernet" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet">Ethernet</a>. Some controllers come in a single fader package and most others offer 4-8 channels. Most of the manufactures allow you to expand your control surface by connecting more of these fader units together, building larger 24 channel units.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><a style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23755444@N00/2501620949"><img style="border: medium none; display: block; height: 240px; width: 204px;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3124/2501620949_e919c2456f_m.jpg" alt="Apogee with Euphonix control surface" /></a><br />
I just recently in the last two months have started using both of the Euphonix models, the MC Control and the MC Mix, together in my studio. I love these things!  Aside from having nice big faders to <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f800000000ad32db3" title="Audio mixing (recorded music)" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_%28recorded_music%29">mix</a> with, I love the control and flexibility these units bring me in my workflow. Now, I have used other controllers in the past, so I am familiar with the overall effectiveness of having one to work with, but let me tell you a few things about these Euphonix models.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">The Euphonix artist series has two models: the MC control, which is a motorized 4-fader touch sensitive model with a wonderful touch screen, and the MC Mix which features a motorized 8-channel touch sensitive unit without the touch screen. Both of these units use the Eucon protocol.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Eucon is a high-speed bi-directional Ethernet protocol. You hook these units up via Ethernet directly to your computers Ethernet port(s) or via an Ethernet switch. Speeds up to gigabit are supported. The Eucon protocol is 250 times faster than MIDI. Anybody who has experienced the dreadful MIDI logjam (when MIDI notes can’t be processed fast enough and they end up being fired almost like a machine gun after a period of delay) can testify that having a faster protocol to send data is a big plus. Eucon also offers 1024 steps of resolution versus MIDI’s 128 steps. This gives you more control of your fades with less zipper noise.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">The Euphonix MC Control has a wonderful color touch screen and has 12 configurable soft keys that can be configured to use not only specific DAW functions, but also standard file-new, open, and save type commands. They also have bank buttons that let you skip faders in groups of 8. The MC Control also has 8 touch sensitive rotary encoders that can be assigned to control plugin parameters, panning, etc. The MC Mix has in addition to the 8 faders, 8 rotary encoders and 8 displays for surround metering, track names and panning.</p>
<p>The Euphonix system lets you expand up to 36 faders for the ultimate DAW mixing system.</p>
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Since the MC’s support the Mackie Control protocol, HUI as well as Eucon, they can virtually control any application that supports one of these protocols. These controllers work on both the Mac and the PC.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">So as I mentioned, I have been using these controllers in my studio with both DP and Logic Studio 8 and recently Logic Studio 9, as Logic and DP both support the native Eucon protocol. After adding the controller, the DAW recognizes the MC and automatically maps your channels to the faders in the current session that’s loaded.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">My productivity has increased greatly using these controllers. Having the ability to get to certain large groups of channels quickly, and having transport jog and shuttle controls are nice features. Being able to shuttle audio and MIDI back and forth for precise edits really helps. I use the soft keys to add new audio, MIDI and instrument tracks, and the faders are really nice. Having touch sensitivity allows me when working in Logic, to simply touch a fader and the corresponding Logic track gets selected.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">For me, using the faders for gain riding my mixes is much easy and fulfilling than drawing it in with a mouse. I do use a mouse for very precise editing, but 90% of the time I am using the faders. I don’t know if I can put a quantitative number to the time I save using these controllers, but I feel myself working much faster. Maybe its just me, but something about having theses controllers in front of me makes me smile. Probably similar to the notion of making your work space an inviting and creative experience. When I sit down to work and these faders start flying around, I get to feel like I’m on the Big SSL 4K, which I have always dreamed of working on. LOL ……I know I am a total techno geek.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">I highly recommend anyone not using a DAW controller to look seriously into getting one. It will greatly improve your workflow and give you the flexibility and control of mixing using large touch sensitive faders. Check out the tutorial and mixing videos on the Euphonix website for more information on these specific controllers.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Hit the COMMENTS below, SCOREcasters, and tell me your thoughts on using a DAW controller, and if you are using one already, share with us what value it brings to your workflow.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/sig-knaub.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-696" title="sig-knaub" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/sig-knaub.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>Every month I will be talking about the technology that we work with on a day to day basis as well as some tips on how to make your experience writing and composing music as easy as possible without letting the technology get in the way.</p>
<p>These techno toys we deal with can be very intimidating at times. Some of us are just not that technical and we don’t want to be, while others love combing through the manual and look forward to the challenges of taking on a new piece of gear. (In a future issue we will talk about GAS (Gear Acquisition Syndrome).</p>
<p>So what exactly do we have to deal with in our studios on a daily basis? Computers, mixing consoles, DAW controllers, audio interfaces, microphones, patch bays, word clock generators, stereo recorders, MIDI interfaces, MIDI sound modules, and not to mention all the different pieces of software you may use. And, let’s not forget our countless connections: Analog, Digital, MIDI, Ethernet, Video, Internet, etc. If you’re Deane, you probably have a fiber optic cable connected to your forehead as well.</p>
<p>When you sit down with pencil and paper, notation software, or your DAW, you want to turn on your right brain and go to it without thinking “is this hooked up correctly, how come I can’t hear the percussion tracks, and why are the lights dimming around my neighborhood.” (Unless, that is your mood lighting.)</p>
<p>Joe Trapanese mentions in his <a href="../../../2009/06/composer-as-producer-maximizing-your.html">column</a> that using templates is key to kicking your project off on the right foot. I have to agree that these are probably one of the most significant timesavers and methods to improve your creative muse.</p>
<p>So let’s talk specifically about the template in your sequencer or DAW. This template is really nothing more than a blank session that you have pre-configured to have all of your tracks/channels, routing, groupings, stems, and effects laid out in a way that makes your workflow smooth. Some composers use predominantly MIDI tracks and few audio tracks, while others use more audio tracks than MIDI. I have composer friends who may have separate tracks for every piece of the orchestra, percussion, and separate drum tracks. This can easily put you over 100 tracks. Do you need just a few key orchestral instruments? Are you composing with guitar and perhaps need 4-6 audio tracks as well? These are some of the questions to ask. How do I work best? What is the end result? A full mockup score to be redone later on during the scoring stage, or is this a lower budget piece that will use everything as played in your DAW. Whatever your result, start by adding these tracks to your blank template.</p>
<p>Before you do this, I recommend you sit down and spend a few hours or more laying out how you typically score and what are the technical logistics of your studio.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
Start with a list like this:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Small Orchestral Pop Template</span></p>
<p>* 5 external MIDI modules with stereo outputs using 2 MIDI channels on each module<br />
* One GigaSampler with 16 MIDI and16 digital audio outputs via ADAT<br />
* 10 internal Soft synths fed to outputs 1-4 on audio interface<br />
* 8 audio channels in DAW for loops, FX, etc.<br />
* All audio outputs run to external mixer<br />
* Mixer control levels and control room monitoring<br />
* Mixer feeds DAW inputs 1-2 for mixdown</p>
<p>A list similar to this can help you visualize exactly what you have and how things need to be connected and laid out in your DAW. Remember, the goal is to make things easy and simplistic.</p>
<p>From here, start to build out your template by adding tracks and testing them. Make sure your MIDI routing is correct and that you can hear the correct synths, soft synths, etc. If you are using a more complex setup, i.e. multiple computers and MIDI over LAN, these things take time to set up and trouble shoot if you encounter problems. So again, give yourself some time to be able to work out the kinks. You’re a composer – you don’t care that you may need an Ethernet crossover cable instead of a straight through, but your gear does.</p>
<p>Make sure to save your template after every modification.</p>
<p>If you’re using a soft sampler, make sure you have the instances loaded and a stereo or multiple output version configured. If you are pre-loading samples, then load them to their associated channels and test the MIDI and audio routing. (In a future issue we will talk about getting samplers to run outside of your DAW and the 32-bit memory limitation.)</p>
<p>If you are using any type of stems or sub groups, get those added in, and make sure your internal audio buses are working correctly. (Tip: Use a pre-recorded audio test tone on your tracks (audio) to test the audio outputs as well as aux and group busing.)</p>
<p>Add any internal or even external effects to your aux sends, individual tracks, groups, etc.</p>
<p>So we have our template saved with all of our tracks, groups, synths, samplers and effects. One last and very important thing we need to do is validate that your CPU is worthy of your template. One thing I like to do as a test is, using a stopwatch, time how long the template takes to open. If you have many soft samplers in your template and they are loading samples, this could take a while depending on your drive speed and whether you’re using RAID or not. This seems trivial but is actually quite useful if you know it takes 3 minutes to open, you could go get a cup of coffee or a glass of wine, while you’re waiting. This time is also important to know if you have to make any changes to the audio system settings. In Digital Performer for example, every time you open and close the audio driver settings, or change the buffer size, DP must reload the entire contents of the project, so count on another 3 minutes. This can definitely steal your Mojo. This I know first hand as I am currently in DP therapy for cursing at the computer screen during this time.</p>
<p>Record some MIDI and audio data to make sure the CPU can handle all you’ve just asked it to. You may have to change your buffer while recording and again during playback based on the speed of your system, at which point you can join me in therapy. :-)</p>
<p>So once we have our template finalized and working, we can now start writing that award winning Opus without the gear potentially getting in the way and blaming your soft synth for ruining your Oscar nomination.</p>
<p>Now some of you might be thinking about our good friend Murphy, and saying sometimes he likes to visit at the worst of times. Well, my fellow SCOREcasters, I can&#8217;t save you from Mr. Murphy, but I can tell you that by going through this exercise of building your template you’ll have a better understanding of how things are connected. You’ll have documentation and maybe even some type of drawing showing your connections. In the end, this should help you, if….. sorry I meant when you need to troubleshoot your studio setup.</p>
<p>Share with us tips on your templates.</p>
<p>Until next time, happy composing.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/sig-trapanese.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-766" title="sig-trapanese" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/sig-trapanese.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>So here I am, responsible for getting these columns off to a delinquent start!  But, I have a legitimate excuse, which I am going to use to kick off my first post here in my series “Composer as Producer.”</p>
<p>Before I get started, I’ll take a quick moment to explain the purpose of my column.  As a lecturer at UCLA, my personal goal is to train students in the skills they need to bring their music from the initial moment of creativity to the finished product, whether it be a live performance, an electronic recording, or a combination of the two.</p>
<p>Even as the prices of music production equipment continue to fall, and the opportunities for live performances and funding continue to disappear, most schools continue to train composers in the same ways they have for years, falling short of giving composer the essential tools to actually deliver their music to an audience.  The purpose of this column is to help fill in the gap between traditional music training (creativity and technique) and the elusive process of creating a tangible musical product that can be sold, broadcasted, and promoted (making a living).</p>
<p>So back to my excuse and the impetus for this first column.  Yesterday I was called to orchestrate and conduct a short recording session that had an 11am downbeat… today. Without the techniques I speak about below, the answer could not have been ‘Yes.’</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">TEMPLATES</span></p>
<div class="MsoNormal">Templates are a key to beginning your projects off on the right foot.  When orchestrating and preparing parts, use a Sibelius or Finale template with objects that are unique to film music already set- boxed bar numbers in the correct places; both violin lines in the same part; a line dedicated to notating pre-recorded material; correct spacing, etc.  Objects which may not appear in an ideal place when starting from scratch (copyright text, composer text, page numbers, et al.) should be moved to the correct position in both the score and parts.  Formatting the parts in this template (spacing, bar number location, placement of text) is key. Furthermore, upon starting a new project, copy and modify the basic template to fit the unique instrumentation as well as any special needs of the particular session and its musicians.  A reasonable estimate of time save is about 20-40 minutes of detailed editing saved <em>per score</em>.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Perhaps even more useful are templates in sequencing programs.  When using external computers hosting sounds, this standard technique saves us from setting complex MIDI and audio routings within each new session (sometimes for over 150 tracks in modern film composer studios).  But there are a handful of other ways to save yourself time and effort when beginning a sequence and setting up your tracks.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">For Logic users, an entire chain of plugins can be saved as a ‘Channel Strip,’ a small file which preserves the settings of every single plugin loaded on a channel, from samplers to compressors to reverbs.  This feature is accessed above the EQ window on any channel in the Logic mixer.  Once you have created a useful sound that you will want to recall elsewhere in your project or at any point in the future.  These files can then be copied to other computers (Users / Home Folder / Library / Application Support / Logic / Channel Strip Settings) and as of Logic 8, can be shared using Apple’s Me service.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Unique to Digital Performer are V-Racks, short for “Virtual Racks.”  Several plugins can be put into a V-Rack and saved.  These virtual racks are maintained when switching sequences in Digital Performer’s chunks feature, saving what can be upwards of 5 minutes in plugin and sample loading time when switching cues.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Digital Performer, Cubase, and ProTools can also save settings using the plugin’s dedicated save features or the host application’s own plugin saving function.  However, large and complex plugins may not be able to save in the host application’s own plugin interface.  These files may be limited in size and unable to save each parameter or these extensive plugins (this is currently and issue with Digital Performer and Omnisphere; use Omisphere’s own save function to overcome this).</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">These programs allow you to save templates within their own interface, and Logic 8 and Pro Tools 8 both come with pre-made templates including plugins set up by professional engineers.  Plugins such as Kontakt and Stylus RMX allow the saving of multiple channels of instruments and their settings into a single ‘Multi’ file.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style: italic;">ADVANCED TRICK: Do you like the idea or channel strips but you don’t use Logic?  Try Plogue Bidule.  Known as an efficient and stable AU and VST host that can run in both standalone and Rewire, Plogue Bidule comes in a plugin form as well.  Inserted as a virtual instrument in your sequencer, you can create a chain of effects and plugins within the interface of the plugin and save this setting for future use.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><em><br />
</em></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">KEY COMMANDS</span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">The more time your hand spends moving a mouse around the more time you are going to spend focusing on the screen, navigating through deep menus, and in general, being distracted from writing.  Rather than searching for a task that is located 3 menus deep within a certain editor window, most tasks have been assigned a key or set of keys on the QWERTY keyboard that take a fraction of the second to complete</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Tasks that have not been assigned key commands can be created by the use in programs such as Logic and Digital Performer, while the initial set can also be edited to taste.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">The goal any composer has is to write good music with minimal distraction and strain.  Being able to quickly make changes to the material in your sequencer, notation editor, or any other computer program will help break down the ‘virtual wall’ between your creativity and the execution of it using a digital medium.  Learn how to minimize your time on the mouse by with key commands- learn them as you go along, and the more you work, key commands will gradually become part of your process.  I don&#8217;t even think about key commands anymore- they have become second nature.  The result is a fluid interface between creativity and the programs used to solidify it.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style: italic;">ALSO: For Logic users, a key command that is often overlooked is ‘Capture Last Take as Recording.”  As your are playing your sequence, the computer is listening to and remember every note you play between the time you hit play and the time you hit stop.  Using this key command can take that improvisation that turned out to be quite good into an midi region- exactly how you played it!  I never hit record any more…</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><em><br />
</em></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">FILE ORGANIZATION</span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Keeping files organized and safe on your computer will be the last topic of today’s post.  This seemingly boring issue will not seem so boring the day your hard drive fails; or after you waste several hours trying to figure out which file is the one the studio loved; or rewriting a main title cue after accidentally erasing the original.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">First things first- create a single master folder for the project where every file associated with the project will live.  Subfolders can be made within that- Sequences, Rough Mixes, Documents, Videos, etc.  Back up this folder using one of any number of fine products &#8211; SuperDuper, CarbonCopyCloner, SynchronizeX, Time Machine, Retrospect.  In fact, if the project is currently underway, back it up to two places.  And update the backups twice per day at least!</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">This system also makes transferring the entire project between systems very simple.  When moving between your desktop and laptop, rather than gathering files together from all across your system, you can just copy the master folder over to your laptop drive get started.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">One common file organization technique is to use a 2 to 3 letter abbreviation for a project at the beginning of each file associated with it.  For instance, if I was scoring a show named ‘Donald the Duck,’ each sequence, audio mix, or document associated with the show would begin with the abbreviation ‘DD.’  Also, rather than using spaces, which may cause errors on PCs as well as when exchanging files on the internet, many will use underscores instead of spaces.  So if I wrote a cue called ‘River Chase’ for this show, my file would be called ‘DD_1m1_RiverChase.’</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">After that name, a version number will be placed so that changes can be tracked easily.  Say I have written ‘DD_1m1_RiverChase_v1’ and the producer has requested some revisions.  Rather than going into version 1 and editing that, I will duplicate the file and rename it ‘DD_1m1_RiverChase_v2,’ preserving my original version in case it is needed later in the process.  Depending on the process, even a sub-version may be used for smaller changes, i.e. ‘DD_1m1_RiverChase_v2-1’ or ‘DD_1m1_RiverChase_v2b.’</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Timecode can be placed in filenames as well.  Rather than using colons or periods usually associated with timecode, dashes will translate much better when passing files to different people and systems.  Usually the hour is dropped because this is indicated by the first digit of the cue number (‘1m1’ in the title above would translate to ‘Hour 1, Music Cue 1.’  Similarly, music cue 2 in hour 3 will be designated ‘3m2.’)</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Perhaps the final mix file of this cue will look like this: ‘DD_1m1_RiverChase_v3_03-31-15.’  That timecode at the end would translate to 3 minutes, 31 seconds, and 15 frames.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Dates can also be used.  To differentiate between dates and timecode, most often the punctuation of dates is removed so that today, June 1<sup>st</sup> 2009 would become 060109.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NEXT TIME: WHY EVERY COMPOSER SHOULD OWN AN ANALOG SYNTH</span></div>
