Many people just see it as a way to fill their iPhones. While it certainly is pretty good at doing that, it also can serve as a tool to give you access to music you might want to listen to for inspiration. iTunes also works great for cataloguing your own work for reference, but we will come to that in a future article.<\/p>\n<p>So what are we talking about here? I don\u2019t know about you, but at least I am constantly prompted to cal up this or that film score. People say \u201eI want something like XY did in that film!\u201c. Fortunately, with a big record collection, I usually have that particular score at hand &#8211; now all I need is to find it. Also quite often I search for inspiration in my collection. I want to listen to a bunch of horror film scores, but don\u2019t know any particular names of films or composers. Or maybe I remember which year that particular album was from, but not the name. Either way, iTunes can help in these situations, provided that you organize your collection efficiently.<\/p>\n<p>In this article I will show you a number of tips and tricks for making iTunes effortlessly present you with exactly what you are looking for when searching for inspiration.<\/p>\n<p>1) Tag your stuff: It may be painfully obvious, but still most people do not correctly tag their music. Every track should have as much information as possible, including composer _and_ artist(s). If multiple artists (for example soloists) perform in one album, give all of them a common album artist. This will keep your albums together. Also fill out the year and CD number as well as track number tags. These are very important for finding tracks quickly.<\/p>\n<p>2) Use the grouping for combining different sections of a work: The grouping tag is the most important tag for quickly finding tracks that belong together. For classical works, place the composer in this tag, followed by the name of the work. For example \u201eElfman &#8211; Serenada Schizophrana\u201c. You can then just have the title of the movements in the track name and do not need to clutter six or seven tracks with the title of the work, followed by the movement title. This also allows you to at a glance see all the recordings you have of a particular work by just searching for its grouping.<\/p>\n<p>3) Unify names: Quite a lot of names can either be spelled different ways (take Russian composers, for example: Shostakovich vs. Schostakowitsch) or are susceptible to being spelled wrong (for example Bernard Herrmann has had gruesome things done to this first and last name!). This happens a lot even on commercial releases &#8211; I have even seen an album in a major music store by \u201eJohn Wilaims\u201c. At least they were consistent in spelling the poor man wrong in the whole booklet, too. Check this &#8211; nothing is worse than frantically looking for that Michael Giacchino album which you absolutely know to have in your library, but not finding it, because the man is misspelled. This is double worse &#8211; and embarrassing &#8211; when happening in front of a client.<\/p>\n<p>4) Use album covers: Many of us are visual thinkers. Having album covers for every album is a bit of work, especially if you need to scan in covers of rare to find albums, but especially in the light of iTunes 11\u2019s reliance on a grid of covers as the main method of navigating, it is simply a must. Album covers also go a long way to bring as much of the good old vinyl days to the digital age. As artists we should always make sure to include cover art with albums as a token of respect for the talented people who created this artwork.<\/p>\n<p>5) Use the sorting tags: In the track info window (Apple\/Cmd-I) you will find a large number of tags that are used for sorting albums. You can use these to influence the order in which your albums are displayed inside the library. Basically what iTunes does is use those tags (if present) for sorting, but will still use the regular tags when displaying the albums. As an example, if you have an album called \u201eX\u201c and call it \u201eA\u201c in the Album for Sorting tag, it will appear under the letter \u201eA\u201c inside your library, but will still be called \u201eX\u201c. These tags are extremely useful when grouping together albums that belong together in a series in a particular order, but would be sorted differently because of their names. One such series of film scores that comes to mind is Harry Potter. \u201eC\u201c comes before \u201eS\u201c or \u201eP\u201c in the alphabet, so the second film (Chamber of Secrets) is sorted before the first (Philosopher\u2019s\/Sorcerer\u2019s Stone). Just name them \u201eHarry Potter 1\u201cand so on\u00a0 as the Album for Sorting and you are done. You will find that searching for \u201eChamber of Secrets\u201c will still have the album turn up in the search results because iTunes searches all tags by default and the sorting tags do not override the regular tags as far as searching is concerned.<\/p>\n<p>6) Use unused tags: Chances are high you never need that BPM tag. Firstly, the BPM tend to change quite frequently in our kind of music. Secondly, you are unlikely to ever need to play your newest film score at the hottest club in town, where beat-matching is a must. Use this tag for organizing your music. You might for example enter the shelf number that particular CD is stored on, or the hard drive number where the cue is located. Anything that has numbers.<\/p>\n<p>7) Use TV tags: Every file in iTunes can have the tags reserved for TV shows, even if it is not TV show or even a video file at all. Of course when cataloguing music for TV shows it makes perfect sense to use these tags. Enter the season, the episode number and additional information. For all other files, use these tags for other information, like the director of the movie, or the scoring stage the album was recorded at.<\/p>\n<p>8) Be creative with genres: If you mainly have film scores in your library, there is no reason to leave the genre for all of them as \u201eSoundtrack\u201c. Firstly, as we all know, it is sort of incorrect because the soundtrack is everything you can hear, not just the actual score; secondly it makes no sense to have \u201eAlien\u201c in the same genre as \u201eThe Sea Hawk\u201c. Change the genre to \u201eSciFi\u201c or \u201eGolden Age\u201c and, voil\u00e0, searching for \u201eGolden Age\u201c will magically pull up all scores fitting that era.<\/p>\n<p>9) Understand the search function: The one basic thing about iTunes\u2019 search to know is that it uses the \u201eAND\u201c operator by default. So when looking for \u201eJerry Goldsmith SciFi\u201c it will pull up all tracks that have these two terms somewhere in their tags. \u201eAlien\u201c will be in there; \u201eFreud\u201c not so much. You can also search for ratings: \u201eAlan Menken ****\u201c will pull up all albums with his name and four stars.<\/p>\n<p>10) Make Smart Playlists: There will be an additional article about some Smart Playlists that have proven indispensable for me, but here\u2019s my favorite: Make a playlist with the condition \u201eLast played more than a year ago\u201c. You will discover tons of great music that you haven\u2019t listened to in ages. I guarantee you will immediately feel inspired to write the next big thing!<\/p>\n<p>I hope these ten tips sparked your interest in iTunes and helped you get your collection up to speed.
