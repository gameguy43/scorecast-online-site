		<description><![CDATA[I second lhsanders--a very good read. Any update on this? What conclusions have you drawn?

I seem to be very much in the same boat as many who have commented here. While I began my own &quot;little experiment&quot; purely focused on producing stock music for media, I eventually grew tired (OK, bored) of writing &quot;generic&quot; music and inevitably slipped back into more conscientious &quot;listenable&quot; music. (Interestingly, a lot of these sell better.)

I&#039;ve heard of a number of services like tunecore.com and lulu.com although I don&#039;t feel that I have enough quality material yet to fill a whole CD. But printed CDs..? Hmm, judging by the experiences here, it&#039;s not a profitable avenue unless you have a big starting fan base or play regular live gigs.

Re: Adding value to a product. RadioHead just did this with their &quot;The King of Limbs&quot; album--offering signed copies at a premium (and a &quot;newspaper&quot; album insert, whatever that is) and the rest as downloads.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, &lt;a href=&quot;http://MovieScoreMedia.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MovieScoreMedia.com&lt;/a&gt; did cover all the costs, but I make a smaller percentage of the profit. Though overall, that CD has made more money for me than my other self released efforts. Which goes to show how important marketing is, as well as having created it&#039;s own built in audience of film score fans. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For printing CD&#039;s, I use an Epson R-340 photo printer which also prints directly on CD&#039;s. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And my opinion on releasing &quot;film music&quot;, is that I really enjoy listening to music with a melody. So, most of my releases have been compilations where I picked out music of mine that I felt was musical and worth listening to. There are plenty of ambient cues that I&#039;ve written that may have served a dramatic purpose in a film, but would bore the hell out of me if I was listening to it on CD. I think it&#039;s great to write music for the sake of writing music for people to hear, but I&#039;m primarily focused on my career and getting paid to write for visual media.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now getting live concerts going, that&#039;s difficult to make happen without having a big name. I was very fortunate in getting a piece performed by the Golden State Pops Orchestra, and that was a result of playing clarinet with the group for a few years and making a lot of friendships (particularly with the conductor), and I was extremely pleased to be asked to have my music performed. &lt;br&gt;Video from the concert:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrkcnsDoCZU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrkcnsDoCZU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other concert was produced by a friend who happened to work at an arts organization, and without their help, I definitely could not have put on something like that. I guess the important thing here, is that it still takes a lot of networking and letting people know about my music to get them interested in doing performances.&lt;br&gt;Here&#039;s one video from that performance:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYCTq_bbwcM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYCTq_bbwcM&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;These were instrumental albums of improvised hymn arrangements &amp; solo J.S. Bach &quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thats an interesting point that you brought up Mike - I wonder the difference in sales between pure instrumental music, and film music.  Instrumental music is a totally different ball park when it comes to selling CDs, compared to film music.  Film music sometimes might not &quot;make sense&quot; to the layman on the street without the medium of the film to complement it (or vice versa), however instrumental music composed for listening purposes can be easier for people to understand and enjoy...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thats a great idea actually Deane.  I&#039;m reading a few books on marketing at the moment, and one important point is to add as much value to your product as you can.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#039;ll definitively look into more ways that I could add value to my CD&#039;s while I sell them...in fact I have some cunning ideas already as to how to add value to the product, at no real expense to yourself.  I&#039;ll share these once I have an idea if they work or not during my sales :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi George, that &lt;a href=&quot;http://MoveScoreMedia.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MoveScoreMedia.com&lt;/a&gt; website looks interesting - I think I remember seeing it before, but never looked into it.  Did they cover all of your costs of duplication and marketing for you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How did you get on printing your own CD-R&#039;s? Did you print the image on the CD using your own home printer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also did you sell just &quot;Film Music&quot; or have you tried composing music simply for personal listening purposes? I think my music is in between - its used a lot for media, but a few people contacted me and said they would like to download my music just to listen to it. I wonder does pure &quot;film music&quot; work without the medium of film?...although thats another discussion entirely :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also interesting is what you said about the live concerts - thats a great idea, and I&#039;d love to hear about how you organised the concert, and any problems you came up against during the process.  I did a few piano performances in front of a crowd during college, and its an exhilarating experience - something I&#039;d love to get back into.  Also another question (sorry lol!) - was the music performed your film music or something that you composed just for the concerts?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Probably the number one rule in music retail is &quot;Add Value to Every Sale.&quot; It seems that the music business is in such a state that it is no longer good enough - in fact, it&#039;s expected - that the customer get more for their 10 or 15 bucks than just a program&#039;s worth of music. The boundaries of this concept are being broadned yet again by Apple&#039;s recent introduction of &quot;iTunes LP&quot;, which is pretty amazing if you haven&#039;t already checked it out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mike brings up an interesting point above with his explanation of how DiscMakers handles you waiting awhile between orders, and their choice to dump your material, presumably to make space on their servers for people who are making them money right this second. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why not take a cue from the labels that are still left (all whom are struggling, by the way) and use your initial order run of 100-200, or even 1000 (f you have that kind of a fanbase), CDs and make them &quot;limited-edition signed&quot; copies. When they run out, they are gone. Just MovieScore Media, ScreenArchives, or Varese does. Make it clear that after those run out, the only places left to purchase that album are view the digital download sites that you use.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seems like a solid biz plan for adding urgent measurable value to your physical CDs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah...they send you an email saying &quot;Your content is about to expire&quot;. Either you order soon....or you have to go through the whole upload process (for the graphics &amp; text info) and upload audio files or mail in another CD master.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frankly, that&#039;s what made the process a pain. My orders were spaced just far enough apart that I finally missed the deadline. I re-submitted once; but it&#039;s a hassle, to order just 100 CDs. So at this point, the albums are on iTunes, etc. -- no hard copies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, when you&#039;re ordering 100 at a time, the cost/CD is higher. Some genres (i.e. classical) just don&#039;t sell super fast, so you never order in real bulk quantities.

<p>Frankly, that&#39;s what made the process a pain. My orders were spaced just far enough apart that I finally missed the deadline. I re-submitted once; but it&#39;s a hassle, to order just 100 CDs. So at this point, the albums are on iTunes, etc. &#8212; no hard copies.</p>
<p>Also, when you&#39;re ordering 100 at a time, the cost/CD is higher. Some genres (i.e. classical) just don&#39;t sell super fast, so you never order in real bulk quantities. For digital distribution, the overhead &#038; profit margin are the same no matter how many you sell.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Also, unless things have changed, DiscMakers will eventually discard the stored master info from a short-run duplication (after 6mo or something like that). Replication requires making a glass-master disc -- and I think that is kept longer (if not indefinitely).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or maybe they&#039;ve changed things since I had albums (2) duplicated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using a combination of DiscMakers &amp; CDBaby My two CDs sold somewhere in the neighborhood of 1500-2000 units. I lost count after a few years. I consider this a reasonable success...though if the sales are spread over several years it feels less impressive. This is not &quot;pay the bills money&quot; -- more like a few extra dollars for gear, upgrades, repairs, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Digital sales via iTunes, CDBaby, Napster, etc. (all arranged &amp; orchestrated by CDBaby&#039;s Digital Distribution service) have been slow but steady -- with zero overhead costs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Note: These were instrumental albums of improvised hymn arrangements &amp; solo J.S. Bach -- and both albums were shared with co-artists. So they are a little different from film music scores. But hopefully this info will be helpful anyway.]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I put out my first (and so far only) &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/jamesolszewski&quot; target=_new rel=nofollow rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CD&lt;/A&gt; in mid-March 2008, through &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.cdbaby.com/&quot; target=_new rel=nofollow rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CD Baby&lt;/A&gt;. I did a short run of 100 CD-Rs through DiscMakers, and I couldn&#039;t have been happier with the experience. I gave away about 20 or so, and sold the rest. I have about 15 left, scattered around- 8 still at CD Baby, 3 in my studio, the rest in a shop in my home town being sold locally- sort of like consignment.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I broke even pretty quickly, the rest being gravy. The best thing about a company like DiscMakers, they retain all the &quot;information&quot;- the images, the song files, specs on the CDs, etc.- so if i ever need to do another run, I just let them know how many more I want and they spring into action (once the credit card clears)!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I&#039;m working on my second CD now, and I&#039;m struggling with whether to sell physical CDs. My particular demographic (thank you &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.reverbnation.com/jamesolszewski/&quot; target=_new rel=nofollow rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ReverbNation&lt;/A&gt;) for my solo work is women 40+, so I think maybe I will. But even so, I plan to offer hi-res downloads, along with PDFs of all the artwork, plus more, in the download package. This will justify my charging a little bit closer to the physical CD price for the download, and folks will still get the artwork. I&#039;m thinking of throwing in images of my handwritten music in progress. That&#039;s the beauty of downloads- you can throw in extra stuff people will value with virtually no extra cost.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This next CD I&#039;ll probably print 200, or I may make the leap to 300, replicated, not duplicated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(Sidebar: CD Duplication means CD-R. The company burns your CD as you would at home. CD Replication is &quot;the real deal&quot;. They make a glass master of your CD, and press the CDs physically, instead of using lasers and special ink to &quot;burn&quot; them. This is how CDs from your favorite artists are done. Easiest way to tell duplication from replication (from what I&#039;ve found), duplicated CDs have that purplish or greenish tint to their undersides. Replicated CDs are silver. Replicated CDs tend to last longer (probably something to do with oxidation), and (sadly) some people consider duplicated CDs to be &quot;amateur&quot;.) Sorry for the tangent, figured I&#039;d throw it out there.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/BR&gt;&lt;/BR&gt;&lt;/BR&gt;&lt;/BR&gt;&lt;/BR&gt;&lt;/BR&gt;&lt;/BR&gt;&lt;/BR&gt;&lt;/BR&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cool experiment, I&#039;ve been running a similar experiment for the last 4 years, and I&#039;ve barely broken even to cover my expenses. It&#039;s really hard to sell film music CD&#039;s especially if you&#039;re not a big name like John Williams or Danny Elfman, and don&#039;t have a publicist marketing your music. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#039;ve self released 4 CD&#039;s via CD Baby, and had another released by &lt;a href=&quot;http://moviescoremedia.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;moviescoremedia.com&lt;/a&gt; (which was awesome to not have to cover any costs for duplication or marketing). My first 2 CD&#039;s, I bought really nice printable CD-R&#039;s, and printed nice covers and basically created the CD&#039;s myself, and have sold 70 physical CD&#039;s to date between the two. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My 3rd CD, I decided I wanted to make it look nice, and ordered 200 copies via Oasis. It was ridiculously expensive, so I charged slightly higher for CD&#039;s. And I&#039;ve only sold 11 in the past year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My 4th CD, I decided I didn&#039;t want to spend at all on CD&#039;s, and made available only as a digital download. It&#039;s only been around for a few months, but it&#039;s about recouped it&#039;s costs (about $55 for CD Baby fees). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On top of selling CD&#039;s, about 50% of income from my sales is from digital downloads, mostly from iTunes (and most of that is from iTunes-Europe), but I&#039;m generating income from various other places like Napster and CD Baby&#039;s own digital sales. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That said, through CD Baby, I probably make about $20-30 a month in CD Sales, and that&#039;s through a minimal amount of self marketing when I&#039;m not busy composing. Though in the last year, I&#039;ve had two opportunities to have my music performed in live concerts, and each time I was able to sell about 40 CD&#039;s, and making those live appearances has been much more effective than trying to sell my CD&#039;s online.]]></description>
