Grab a hot cup of nog and a slice of that pumpkin pie and settle in for a terrific discussion with Simon as he walks you through working on several of the highest-grossing pictures of all-time, including <em>Titanic </em>and <em>Avatar</em>, plus the complete behind-the-scenes story of the score to his newest film, <em>The Magnificent Seven</em>, where he took up the mantle of his dear friend James Horner and turned out one of 2016&#8217;s most notable musical achievements.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://outputsounds.com" target="_blank">Output</a> first came on the sample library scene nearly a year and a half ago with their groundbreaking and highly acclaimed release REV (<a title="REVIEW: REV by Output" href="../../../2013/11/20/review-rev-by-output" target="_blank">SCOREcast review here</a>). The library was so forward thinking with such an unorthodox concept that many have wondered how they could possibly follow up that release.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The answer comes in the form of their brand new pulse-driven sample library: <b>SIGNAL</b>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SIGNAL<b> </b>combines the warmth of analog and aggressive synthesis with an immense collection of organic, sampled instruments, but the true lure of the library rests with the inclusion of its “Pulse Engine”, which allows for up to four independent, tempo-locking rhythms across two separate sound source layers to create that “heartbeat” at the center of your track.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We will take a detailed look at the library from the ground up to see what’s included, how it operates and ultimately what it will add to your existing sample library arsenal.</span></p>
<h2>General Overview</h2>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SIGNAL<b> </b>requires Kontakt 5.3.1 or higher and is compatible with the Kontakt Free Player. The library is immense, weighing in at around 40GB. Output utilizes the <a title="Continuata Utility" href="http://www.continuata.com/" target="_blank">Continuata Connect Download Utility</a> and I personally had a smooth and swift download of the content.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The library will need to be activated within the Native Instruments Service Center before it will become available within the library pane of your Kontakt browser.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before unpacking this beast, let&#8217;s look at a quick listing of everything included in the library as well as its features:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">500 Pulse Instruments for instant playability</li>
<li class="p1">40GB of content, including analog synths, digital synths and organic instruments</li>
<li class="p1">Up to four separate pulses at one time</li>
<li class="p1">All pulses lock to tempo</li>
<li class="p1">Rhythms: Looper, Step Sequencers, Arpeggiators, LFO’s</li>
<li class="p1">Four central MACRO sliders unique to each of the 500 Pulse Instruments</li>
<li class="p1">Effects can control global parameters and individual layers</li>
<li class="p1">Convolution reverb engine</li>
<li class="p1">Advanced mode for access to all parameters</li>
<li class="p1">Copy and paste settings between layers</li>
<li class="p1">Smart tagging preset menu</li>
<li class="p1">Simple design and ease of use</li>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SIGNAL<b> </b>contains just one patch in the instruments folder by which all the contents of the library can be accessed, which I think it is a brilliant layout. The developer recommends (and I agree) that you access the “preset” browser page first when initially diving into the library. This can be accessed by simply clicking on any preset name (e.g. &#8220;Dark Clacks&#8221;, pictured above) from the main page. The browser is laid out in a familiar, yet very welcomed format; simply click on one (or many) of the “smart tags” in the left-side palette and the right window pane will provide a listing of compatible instruments, based on your choices.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are five hundred — That&#8217;s right… 500! — different instruments in SIGNAL<b> </b>and<b> </b>I couldn’t have asked for a better way to audition them than the way this browser is constructed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So how does it sound on a first play through?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I clicked on “Epic” and “Organic” and chose the patch “Sun King” from the browser – I played a three-note D minor triad and heard a deep, gritty, pulsating arpeggiated figure with two intersecting polyrhythms. Awesome. I proceeded to get lost over the next hour sampling various different instruments from the browser and the immediate attention to the production value and execution of the patches were very impressive.</span></p>

<h2>The Pulse Engines</h2>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<div id="attachment_2233" style="width: 399px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://outputsounds.com"><img class="wp-image-2233 size-medium" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.12.10-389x374.png" alt="" width="389" height="374" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.12.10-389x374.png 389w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.12.10-640x615.png 640w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.12.10-300x288.png 300w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.12.10.png 649w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pulse Engines</p></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The true heart of SIGNAL rests within its “Pulse Engines” page. At first glance the layout may seem daunting and complex, but Output has made the source audio flow so intuitively that you’ll want to dig deeper and deeper at the sounds and the engine’s capability.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SIGNAL<b> </b>gives you two separate sound sources that can be loaded and played in unison. Simply clicking on the “Signal Pulse Engines” window in the middle of the page will disable the pulse engine, leaving just the sound sources by themselves. Each sound source has it’s own channel strip  and when you click on the instrument picture/name it will open the sound source browser. There is an immense collection of synths and organic instruments in the browser that can be quickly loaded into the existing patch. This is a fantastic addition as you can quickly tryout new sounds in your loaded instrument that may mesh even better to your ears than before. Don’t want the “Sub Sine”? Why not load up a deep sampled “Muted Guitar” and see how that sounds? The possibilities are endless. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Let’s focus on <em>Pulse Engine A</em> for now (<em>Pulse Engine B</em> has all the functionality identical to Pulse Engine A). You will see a tab of “Main Rhythm” and “2</span><span class="s2"><sup>nd</sup></span><span class="s1"> Rhythm”, each able to be activated or deactivated by clicking the corresponding power switch. The “Main Rhythm” is the first engine your source audio will pass through and you have multiple options to create that “pulse” from the audio. SIGNAL<b> </b>gives you access to a Wave Form (LFO), Step Sequencer, Arpeggiator or a Loop mechanism (see picture above under Engine B) to modulate the audio signal. Regardless of which option you choose, you can manipulate the time format via bars, standard signatures (1/2, 1/4, 1/16, etc.), and dotted or triplet subdivisions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The “2</span><span class="s2"><sup>nd</sup></span><span class="s1"> Rhythm” will take the carrier signal through an additional rhythmic manipulation, available to you via LFO or Step Sequencer. The level of control and audio quality of all these parameters is stunning, making it simple to create highly useable and complex rhythmic figures on the fly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As mentioned, all this can be done with Pulse Engine B as well, but with a completely separate (or same) audio source.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> SIGNAL</span> also makes it very easy for you to copy/paste one rhythm in Pulse Engine A to Pulse Engine B through an elegant transfer window. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_2232" style="width: 399px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://outputsounds.com"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2232" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.03.11-389x374.png" alt="Macro Sliders" width="389" height="374" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.03.11-389x374.png 389w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.03.11-640x615.png 640w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.03.11-300x288.png 300w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.03.11.png 649w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Macro Sliders</p></div>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The four available macro sliders are perhaps the most flexible and intuitive feature in SIGNAL. Output meticulously crafted these macros so they are completely unique to each of the 500 instruments found in the library. I immediately assigned each macro slider to an available slider on my MIDI controller. The macros can make the sound modulate from subtle to drastic just from the flick of the slider. For instance, you can distort, widen, open/close filters, blend layers or completely change one of the four available rhythms on the fly. Moving around all four macros at the same time pull out instant inspiration and promote these patches for live performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is a Macro Page from the instrument menu that will allow you too see which particular instrument parameters are being controlled by the sliders and these can be further adjusted as well.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Want to go even deeper with the sounds? You can quickly access the “Advanced Tab” from the Pulse Engines page or the the “Effects” page for even further tweaking. All effects can be applied globally or individually between Pulse Engine A or Pulse Engine B.</span></p>

<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Orchestral percussion is a venture that many sample library developers have challenged throughout recent years. The availability of large recording stages &amp; halls in tandem with world class players have provided a wide range of options for the modern media composer. <em>Impact Soundworks</em>, known for their respected line of ethnic instruments, guitar (Shreddage 1 &amp; 2) and sound design (Juggernaut, Celestia) libraries, have crossed into the field with <em><strong>Rhapsody: Orchestral Percussion</strong></em>.</p>
<p>A common theme amongst modern day composers is, “You can never have too much percussion.” I certainly agree with the masses but will still ask, “What will Rhapsody add that I do not already have in my existing orchestral percussion libraries?” Let&#8217;s take a detailed look at the library from the ground up and see how Rhapsody responds to that question.</p>
<h2>At First Glance</h2>
<p>For this review, we took a look at the full version of Rhapsody ($199 intro and $249 regular MSRP), which boasts an impressively large collection of drums, auxiliary percussion, hand drums and chromatic instruments with three user-controllable mic positions. The developer also offers an &#8220;essentials&#8221; version that contains most of the core instruments at 16-bit samples with the close and hall mic positions. All instruments have been deeply sampled with up to 10X round-robin and 5X velocity layers in both the full and &#8220;essentials&#8221; versions.</p>
<p>Both versions will require the latest retail version of Kontakt 5.3. Most of the included instruments contain multiple articulations as well as dynamic rolls that can be controlled via the mod wheel.</p>
<h2>Instruments</h2>
<p>Here is a listing of all the included instruments with those underlined as being included in the ESSENTIALS package(we will look deeper into the organization of the instruments later in the review):</p>

<p>The full version comes with a choice to receive the library as a 16-Bit(4 GB) or 24-Bit(9 GB) package. Both versions are available via download delivery at <a href="http://impactsoundworks.com/rhapsody-orchestral-percussion/" target="_blank">www.impactsoundworks.com</a>. The library comes with a well-documented and comprehensive users guide that can also be downloaded via the product page on their website. I highly recommend reviewing the manual as it has a nice breakdown of all the included instruments and articulations as well as tips on how to use/mix library and conserve system resources.</p>
<h2>Interface</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2180" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rhapsody_UI_1-389x165.jpg" alt="" width="389" height="165" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rhapsody_UI_1-389x165.jpg 389w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rhapsody_UI_1-300x127.jpg 300w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rhapsody_UI_1.jpg 631w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></p>
<p>The GUI for Rhapsody certainly gets right to the point and provides the user with an efficient means for editing and sound sculpting the instruments from the ground level. All of the options you need for editing are provided right from the main page with no multiple menus, macros, etc. The GUI supports the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access to all 3 microphone positions — Close, Stage &amp; Far — with control over Mix, Panning and Width. Mics can also be purged from memory to save on CPU.</li>
<li>A menu to pull up a specific instrument (see All in 1 Patches) with individual volume and tuning settings.</li>
<li>Standard ADSR Envelope</li>
<li>3 Band “G” EQ</li>
<li>Access to an internal reverb with settings for wetness and size.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Patches</h2>
<p>The library organizes the patches into 2 distinct options:</p>
<h4>All-in-1 Patches</h4>
<p>Groups of instruments are all included into their respective percussion family and stretched over the range of the keyboard. For instance, ROP Aux Percussion will contain all of the auxiliary instruments into one patch. The instrument selector allows the user to make individual adjustments to all editable features for that specific instrument or articulation(the articulation is also displayed in a box each time the respective key is triggered on the keyboard). There is also an option to have any changes applied globally to all the included instruments. These patches also allow the user to split the instruments out along multiple outputs through Kontakt.</p>
<h4>Single Instruments</h4>
<p>We also have the choice of splitting each instrument into its own patch versus globally with the other instruments. This has become a common practice with many developers but completely is up to the user’s preference. I personally prefer the single instrument approach but many of my colleagues do prefer the latter. It is worth noting that all the patches in Rhapsody provide an option to save any preferred settings that can be recalled for later use.</p>
<h2>Overall Sound and Playability</h2>
<p>So lets get back to the original question and see if we can provide some insight into what may or may not set Rhapsody apart from our existing crop of Orchestral Percussion libraries. Impact Soundworks’ noted intention with the library was to provide a flexible and efficient route to Orchestral Percussion that can easily fit into whatever orchestral palette you frequent.</p>
<p>Loading up the ROP Drums and Ensembles Patch at the initialization stage has the Close Mic’s gain at the mid-point of the mix knob while the Stage Mic is gradually less and the Hall Mic ever more so. This is a recommended starting point from the developer to achieve a nice orchestral balance. The setting noted here has a more dry but no less detailed timbre than what we are used to from recent percussion libraries. Once I increased the gain on the overall patch (-6db to unity gain) as well as the gain on the Close Mic, the level of detail and body on the Bass Drum was easily more apparent.</p>
<p>The inclusion of a heavy mix on both the Stage and Hall Mics can easily push the library towards “Epic” territory (along with a boatload of processing) if that’s what the user desires. I found the core orchestral elements could suit my needs quite well. The only instrument that left me wanting a bit “more” out of this group was the Timpani. The timbre and playability responds nicely but the overall dynamic range had me wanting a bit more on the upper velocity layers. This is also a completely subjective opinion and the inclusion of an instrument of this scope in an already extensive package is a great bonus.</p>
<p>The Auxiliary Instruments along with the Cymbals, Gongs Tubular Bells and Crotales all play and sound fantastic. Lets face it, with a percussion library we want to “play” the instrument. Pounding away through the round robins at each dynamic level show a very strong attention to detail in the editing of the samples, making a realistic and fun result to playing these patches. The Hand Drums lend themselves to this extremely well and are a pleasure to play. The Marimba, Xylophone and Glockenspiel have all been captured very well and the tonality and playability is certainly on par with the rest of the library. The flexibility of the Mic Positions allow you to place these instruments in as intimate or as large a setting as needed.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts and Impressions</h2>
<p>My final thoughts on Rhapsody can be summed up into these 3 points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Impact Soundworks set out to develop an Orchestral Percussion Library that was of high quality and content but was ultimately more focused on malleability and workflow. Did they succeed? Yes.</li>
<li>The sheer amount of instruments included is impressive and with no corners cut.</li>
<li>The price point for the full library is an absolute steal and makes this an attractive option for both newcomers and more tenured users that may have already invested in another option(s). This library can no doubt add to what you may already have in your arsenal.</li>
</ul>
