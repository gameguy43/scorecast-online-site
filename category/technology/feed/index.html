		<description><![CDATA["Oh no! Please, not another social network,“ you may think. But here are a few reasons why you might want to give Google+ a place in your marketing plan as a film composer.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="plus-one-wrap"><g:plusone size="medium" href="../../../2011/08/why-google-could-rock-for-composers.html"></g:plusone></div><p>&#8220;Oh no! Please, not another social network,&#8221; you may think, but if you already approach it like this you won’t have use for it anyway. If you feel different about it, however, and are open minded enough to simply say, &#8220;Hell, why not? Let’s give it a try and if it sucks, I am outta there,&#8221; then you might want to read on.</p>
<p>Why am I saying that <a href="https://plus.google.com/111918910792221111756" target="_blank">Google+</a> will have huge advantages for composers and musicians in general? (Please keep in mind that I am not trying to compare it to other social networks. We all know what&#8217;s possible with them … and what&#8217;s not!)</p>
<h4><strong>Circles</strong></h4>
<p>At first sight it might look a bit irritating, but once understood, the concept of Circles make big sense. Basically, Circles are nothing more than lists you are able to create for specific people. You can create a Circle for all your clients, or one for all the musicians you might considering hiring for your next project. You may create a Circle for friends and one for family.</p>
<p>The possibilities are almost endless. Just a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have close friends, spread around the globe and you feel like sharing some private news but don’t feel like involving all of your clients? Simply set up a specific Circle by only involving your friends!</li>
<li>You are looking for a guitar player to hire for your next project. Isn’t it a great option to only send a post out to your &#8220;hire musicians&#8221; Circle and leave the stream &#8220;uncluttered&#8221; for your clients or friends?</li>
<li>One of your hobbies might be Lucid Dreaming and you want to share and spread your experience but also learn from other people. Put them all in a Circle.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Hang Outs</span></h4>
<p>This is really a great feature! A Hang Out is nothing less than a group video chat conference. Wouldn’t it be simply cool to hang out with your bandmates who are spread around the country and working out a new idea? Wouldn’t it be of great advantage to have a video conference between an audio director and a co-working composer discussing an upcoming project? Wouldn’t it be awesome to directly talk to your hired remote musician to discus that violin arrangement?</p>
<h4><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Huddles</span></h4>
<p>Woot? Yes, a huddle is basically a &#8220;text chat&#8221; between two or several members on your mobile phone. It works really well and gives you the option to arrange, e.g. a changing meeting, letting several people know that you might be late due to a traffic jam or whatever … you get the idea!</p>
<h4><strong>The Stream and your posts</strong></h4>
<p>There is really lot to the Stream and how you can post content on <a href="https://plus.google.com/111918910792221111756" target="_blank">Google+</a>. One of the strongest features is that you are not limited to 140 characters—you can almost write a full-length blog post. I couldn’t say it better than <a href="http://profiles.google.com/mike.elgan" target="_blank">+Mike Elgan</a> did:</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of saying, &#8216;I’m going to write a blog post now,&#8217; or &#8216;I’m going to send an e-mail,&#8217; or &#8216;I think I’ll tweet something,&#8217; you simply say what you have to say, then decide who you’re going to say it to.</p>
<p>If you address it to “<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Public</em></span>” it’s a blog post.<br />
If you address it to “<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your Circles</span></em>” it’s a tweet.<br />
If you address it to your “<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>My Customers</em></span>” Circle it’s a business newsletter.<br />
If you address it to a single person, it can be a letter to your mother.<br />
I’d say this is pretty revolutionary.</p></blockquote>
<p>I simply have to agree with him!</p>
<p>I hope I was able to give you a bit of an insight of what is possible with <a href="https://plus.google.com/111918910792221111756" target="_blank">Google+</a>. In my opinion, social networking is vital, important, and necessary—especially as a self employed composer. Please consider that <a href="https://plus.google.com/111918910792221111756" target="_blank">Google+</a> is still in beta and I am sure there are lots of awesome features to come.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[With Pro Tools 9, Avid has finally taken steps to reach out directly to media composers. Let's take a look under the hood.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="plus-one-wrap"><g:plusone size="medium" href="../../../2011/01/brockmann-pt9.html"></g:plusone></div><p>In the composing business these days, as well as all forms of audio production and engineering, we can&#8217;t live without our DAW (digital audio workstation) software. In some ways Pro Tools has always been the “big kahuna” of audio software, yet most composers I work with have happily spent their careers avoiding it, finding more composing functionality and “bang for the buck” with competitor products such as MOTU Digital Performer and Apple Logic.</p>
<p>Yet one can&#8217;t ignore Pro Tools completely, largely because it&#8217;s so firmly entrenched in audio-for-video post-production, scoring and dub stages, and almost all commercial recording studios. Often, composers are asked to provide finished mixes or stems in Pro Tools compatible format, or in some cases, spotted into a Pro Tools session file. Or, they may do part of their composing, programming, or mixing in their personal studio, but then go to a commercial studio or soundstage for orchestral recording or other parts of the production.</p>
<p>Lately I&#8217;ve received a barrage of e-mail promotions from Avid (formerly Digidesign), touting their new <a href="http://www.avid.com/us/products/family/pro-tools">Pro Tools 9</a> software. Finding the hype generated more confusion than clarity, I&#8217;ve done some research. With Pro Tools 9, Avid has finally taken steps to make their products more compatible and more competitive in the composer&#8217;s world, and maybe even help a few composers finally cross over the line to a Pro Tools purchase.</p>
<p>Unlike last year&#8217;s <a href="../../../2010/01/scorecast-no-26-podcast-shownotes.html">NAMM Show</a>, at which Avid showed… benches (!), this year&#8217;s promises to be center of a lot of interest. Here&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about:</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tools 9</strong><br />
First of all, to review, Pro Tools has always consisted of two distinct product lines: <em>Pro Tools HD</em>, the “high-end” version with TDM hardware, time code and all the other features; and <em>Pro Tools LE</em>, the “junior” version, which included the various M-Box, M-Powered, 003 etc. hardware. Despite being priced competitively with Logic and DP systems, Pro Tools LE always came up short, with puny maximum track count, and—the real deal breaker for composers—<em>no timecode functionality</em>. Additionally, Pro Tools (both versions) has always strictly required the use of their own branded audio hardware. No others need apply.</p>
<p>The new Pro Tools 9 is a continuation of the lower-level line but with several welcome improvements. (They&#8217;ve dropped the “LE” designation.) You now get the timecode ruler and functionality. Maximum number of mono or stereo tracks has been increased to 96 (which finally seems like a decent number). And, although they still have a line of hardware interfaces, Pro Tools 9 can now be used with virtually any AU compatible interface regardless of brand—that means your MOTU, RME, Apogee, or other audio input and output boxes are good to go.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve also included a few other features that used to be extra charge, such as “Digi Translator” which lets you convert files to or from other software using OMF or AAF file protocols, and MP3 file conversion and export.</p>
<p>Avid/Digidesign has always put its fullest features and functions in the high-end HD version, and then “dumbed down” the LE version, removing features that they reserved only for the pros who paid the big bucks. The company has long had the policy of offering additional functional features in extra-charge “Toolkit” options. They have dropped most of these, but there&#8217;s one still available, the “Complete Production Toolkit 2”, which adds surround audio tracks, greater track count, and other features to make PT 9 basically identical in features to ProTools HD 9. Let&#8217;s just say, it&#8217;s a step in the right direction. More about in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tools 9 HD</strong><br />
Now that I’ve busted them a bit, I have to say in fairness that Pro Tools, and particularly Pro Tools <em>HD</em>, really is a “tool for pros”, with especially powerful features for mixing and editing. I didn&#8217;t really get this until I got my own system and got up to speed, but unlike the lower budget good-enough copycat features in the competing software, you really can mix faster and better, edit faster and better, accommodate larger projects with larger numbers of tracks, buses, and inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>Both versions include simple sensible functionality, such as the ability to assign any number of channels all at the same time to any bus, input, output, or automation status. (Anyone who&#8217;s slogged through assigning auxes to buses one stinkin’ channel at a time in DP can appreciate this—hello MOTU??) Once you&#8217;ve learned your “keyboard command focus” technique, you can plow through a huge editing project quickly, which is why it’s so popular for post-production. Its tools for automated mixing are simply the way that sort of thing ought to work, made even better if you get a chance to use one of their <em>Icon</em> hardware mix controllers.</p>
<p>The new DSP functionality that appeared in Pro Tools 8, “Elastic Time”, is head and shoulders better than anything that comes with the competition. Mixing larger score projects, which may include multiple stems and surround routing, is really where Pro Tools HD shines and the others run out of capability. And mixing in Pro Tools HD simply sounds great, whether “in the box” or with a board. I&#8217;ve heard engineers argue about whether it&#8217;s TDM or other aspects that make it sound good, but it&#8217;s obvious that Avid (and other third-party developers as well) have really taken the sound of it very seriously.</p>
<p>It should be noted, too, that Pro Tools phone tech support is exactly what support should be for a product that one uses to make a living: it costs money, you get to talk to someone who’s trained, and there’s less waiting on hold (or busy signals). It&#8217;s easier to find out and then get back to work. Doesn’t it seem fair to pay for something like that, and wouldn’t you offer to do that with the other companies, if they would just be professional about it? I know I would.</p>
<p>One other interesting thing: Pro Tools HD 9 still must be purchased with some sort of hardware system (or as an upgrade for owners of such systems), but once it’s authorized on your iLok, it can also be installed and will run on any computer (such as a laptop) with any brand native-type audio hardware, or no hardware at all. For me that definitely gets a “hmmm…!”</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tools Native</strong><br />
The e-mail blurb on this came through a few weeks ago, then seems to have gotten lost in all the other hype, but this could definitely be of interest to composers. This is actually a hardware package, an interface with a PCI Express card, and also comes with Pro Tools HD 9 software. It includes all the features, large track count, surround, etc., only lacking compatibility with TDM plug-ins.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not exactly cheap at a bit under $6,000 (depending upon hardware interface choices), but starts to look better if you compare it to the five-figure price of some HD TDM systems. And if you&#8217;re into plug-ins, native (RTAS) plug-ins are widely available and often of very high quality. Many custom plug-in packages are available both in native and TDM, but the native versions are often less costly. All of this could better put it in the affordability range for working composers who have shied away up until now.</p>
<p><strong>How is it for composers?</strong><br />
To make a long story short, I don&#8217;t work as a composer or MIDI programmer, so I don&#8217;t have firsthand experience with all the features that a composer would value. I do know that as of version 8, they put in many new advanced features for professional composers, and some composers are using it quite successfully. For more information on that, I would suggest posing your questions in the <strong>COMMENTS</strong> below. Several SCOREcasters are Pro Tools gurus and I&#8217;m sure would be more than happy to chime in with opinions.</p>
<p><strong>Full function: the most cost-effective way to go</strong><br />
If you&#8217;ve always thought it would come in handy to have Pro Tools, but it&#8217;s just too darn expensive, and you don&#8217;t want to put up with limited feature sets, I&#8217;ve saved the best for last:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, buy Pro Tools 9 software alone for $600.</li>
<li>Then, purchase the “Complete Production Toolkit 2” upgrade for $2000. (Stop choking; yes I know that stuff should come with it, but, hey, it’s Pro Tools.) This gives you all of the features of HD: large track count, surround mixing, all the extra mix functionality, only excluding TDM.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can use this on your Mac Pro with whatever audio hardware you already have. Fully functional professional Pro Tools, for mid-$2000’s. Couldn&#8217;t do that before, could you?</p>
<p><strong>Credit &amp; caveat</strong><br />
I want to thank local Avid rep Jon Connolly for bringing me up to speed on all this. If you visit NAMM, go say hi to him at booth #6700. I just want to mention, at this point all of this is new product information, and he said that he was trying to make sure he had all his facts and details straight. If this is something that&#8217;s of interest to you, the dealers (at least the good ones that care about professional users) should be getting all the info on this as well, so check with one of them if you have further questions.</p>
<p>You do go out of your way to patronize truly authoritative pro-audio dealers, don&#8217;t you? It&#8217;s not always about the last dime. Okay, I&#8217;m biting my tongue, ouch!</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more articles, columns, video and more from the NAMM Show floor&#8230; and I hope to see you at the show!﻿</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="plus-one-wrap"><g:plusone size="medium" href="../../../2011/01/james-semple-2010-in-2020.html"></g:plusone></div><p>2010 was a great year for sample libraries. Although some of  us have  the luxury of working with live musicians, samples are the  reality for  a great many composers. In my inaugural post here at <a href="../../.." target="_self">SCOREcastOnline.com</a>, share some trends I observed in the sample library world last year.</p>
<p><strong>Increasingly Powerful Sample Libraries</strong><br />
By the end of 2009, the idea of running comprehensive orchestral   templates from a single machine seemed a real possibility. In 2010,  however, the stakes have been raised again with bigger libraries  demanding more  power than ever. Last year we saw increased multi-core  support, CPU power advancements, huge amounts of RAM, 64-bit  compatibility, and an increased  uptake of SSDs. In addition, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.viennaensemblepro.com/" target="_blank">Vienna Ensemble Pro</a> (released late 2009)  made it cost-effective and easy to set up  multiple machines. Developers  are now seizing this opportunity to  increase the power of their  libraries. Sample playback engines such as <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.native-instruments.com/#/en/products/producer/kontakt-4/" target="_blank">Kontakt</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.soundsonline.com/play/" target="_blank">PLAY</a> continue to  grow in sophistication meaning that modern libraries are  being able to  truly take advantage of multiple microphone positions,  complex  scripting, customized interfaces with more velocity layers and  larger  pools of round-robin samples. All of these demand more and more  power  from DAWs.</p>
<p><strong>New Standards in Sampling</strong><br />
From extensive string projects with top Hollywood engineers to   percussion libraries recorded in premiere London studios, new standards  were  set in the recording of sample libraries. Multiple microphone  positions, improved  legato/portamento, customized interfaces and more  intuitive programming  mean that the bar continues to be raised.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Workflow</strong><br />
In 2010 there were a lot of developments in areas designed to help  with  composers&#8217; workflows. It&#8217;s amazing to think that only twelve months  ago,  there were no string or choir libraries with polyphonic legato.  Now you  have <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.soundsonline.com/Hollywood-Strings" target="_blank">Hollywood Strings</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.tonehammer.com/?p=4276" target="_blank">Requiem</a>, and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cinesamples.com/products/voxos/" target="_blank">Voxos</a>. In addition, VSL released  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vsl.co.at/en/65/71/1877/1528.vsl" target="_blank">Vienna Instrument Pro</a> adding polyphonic legato to their enormous catalog of sample libraries.  AudioBro went one step further adding  polyphonic legato linked to a <em>smart divisi script</em> to create their <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.audiobro.com/" target="_blank">LASS</a> Auto-Arranger. Native Instruments released <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.native-instruments.com/#/en/products/producer/powered-by-kontakt/session-strings/" target="_blank">Session Strings</a> with the <em> automator</em> for easily creating rapid spiccato passages. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.projectsam.com/Products/Boxed-Products/1367" target="_blank">Symphobia 2</a> focused on pre-recorded unison/octave ensembles and pre-orchestrated  textures. Although late in the year, Cinesamples&#8217; <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cinesamples.com/products/cineorch/" target="_blank">CineOrch</a> may have  truly been one of the most remarkable and controversial  releases  featuring fully orchestrated tutti chords and octaves.</p>
<p><strong>Highly-focused Products</strong><br />
Although we had some extensive libraries, we also saw a lot of   highly-focused products. Rather than try to be the ultimate string   library or piano library we had pianos focused on soft, slow playing and   libraries of just string runs or percussion releases of a single   percussive instrument. Given the high initial outlay for creating new   products and the fact that many potential buyers will already own a lot   of high-quality libraries, such niche products seem to be a  particularly  attractive move for developers.</p>
<p><strong>Download Delivery</strong></p>
<p>In conjunction with small, focused products we have seen an   increase in vendors offering download versions of their products. In   some cases there are only download versions. In 2010, some surprisingly   large libraries have also been offered as download-only. Given the   removal of packaging/shipping costs and the fact that (like many   composers) I may suddenly need to buy a library at 2am on Sunday,   downloads are very attractive to most customers&#8230; and do I really need   to mention the instant gratification when impulse buying shiny new   libraries?</p>
<p><strong>Light Version of Libraries</strong><br />
While some vendors have offered stripped-down versions of their   libraries in the past, 2010 saw a number of &#8216;light&#8217; versions of major   libraries with clearly explained upgrade paths. In such economically   trying times, this has been a wise idea allowing consumers to buy-in   cheaply without feeling that they&#8217;re wasting their cash. In certain   cases, the reduced system demands of the light libraries have made them   particularly desirable as alternatives to the full version.</p>
<p><strong>The Return of Algorithmic Reverb</strong><br />
While many have never stopped loving <em>algorithmic</em> reverb, I think  most will agree that <em>convolution</em> has been the darling for the last  couple of years. In 2010,  algorithmic reverbs came back big-time. The  big news was that Lexicon  finally released a software plugin of their  highly esteemed <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lexiconpro.com/product.php?id=163" target="_blank">PCM hardware reverbs</a> (I then bought a PCM 90 at a great  price on eBay!). New versions of  the popular reverb continued to  improve on their fantastic sound. The  fantastic <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.liquidsonics.com/software_reverberate.htm" target="_blank">Reverberate</a> plug-in  combined convolution with some algorithmic reverb qualities and the word  is that the next version of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.audioease.com/Pages/Altiverb/AltiverbMain.html" target="_blank">Altiverb</a> (unfortunately not released in  2010) will also feature more of a hybrid convolution/algorithmic design.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s Next?</strong><br />
Considering the current state of the industry, with budgets and   schedules being forever squeezed, 2010 must have been a tough year to be   a sample developer. Personally, I feel that most have responded in an   incredibly positive and ingenious manner, continuing to produce   game-changing offerings and providing amazing deals to customers. With   the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.namm.org/thenammshow/2011" target="_blank">Winter NAMM Show</a> happening this week in the USA, I guess it&#8217;s time to make some  incredibly inaccurate  predictions! Nonetheless, here are a few things  I&#8217;m hoping for in 2011:</p>
<ul>
<li>EastWest/Quantum Leap to release a brass library to compliment <em>Hollywood Strings</em></li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.spitfireaudio.com/wordpress/" target="_blank">Spitfire</a> to release more commercial libraries</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.spectrasonics.net/" target="_blank">Spectrasonics</a> (who were suspiciously quiet in 2010) to wow us all again with&#8230; something (?)</li>
<li>64-bit <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.steinberg.net/en/products/cubase/start.html" target="_blank">Cubase</a> on Mac</li>
<li>Further developments in the style of Cinesamples&#8217; <em>CineOrch</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
Of course this is all only my viewpoint here. I did buy a  lot of sample  libraries in 2010 but not all of them, and I didn&#8217;t want to  make any  direct comparisons when I only own two of the three big string libraries  or one of the two recent choir releases. I&#8217;m sure a lot of you have  opinions on this subject, so let&#8217;s hear them in the <strong>COMMENTS</strong> below! What were <em>your</em> favorite sample libraries from 2010?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="plus-one-wrap"><g:plusone size="medium" href="../../../2010/11/open-forum-friday-whats-getting-old.html"></g:plusone></div><p>In what many consider to be the Bible of film composing, Fred Karlin’s “<a href="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=scon0d-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=0415941369&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;m=amazon&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr" target="_blank">On the Track</a>” (affliliate link), Jerry Goldsmith is quoted as saying that he was “never embarrassed to use a factory preset”. In interviews, Danny Elfman has mentioned that he used StormDrum 2 extensively on his “Terminator Salvation” score. In several network television shows that are currently airing, you will hear many familiar Omnisphere, Symphobia, and Reaktor patches morphing and wafting their way through the sonic fabric.</p>
<p>Amongst composers, “I design all my own sounds” seems to be a phrase that we like to use. Of course, we cannot be JUST LIKE everyone else, right? However, if you are a composer yourself, then you know the intrinsic value of not having to reinvent the wheel on every single project you take on. With abbreviated schedules being what they are nowadays, who has the time?</p>
<p>That being said, what sounds do you feel get overused? What sounds do you think are now dated and need to be retired? What priority do you place on original sound design, and how do you feel about organic sound design versus ready-made presets from top sound designers in the form of packaged collections?</p>
<p>Furthermore, is original sound design in film scoring (sometimes referred to as &#8220;score design&#8221;) still a necessary step in the creation of a medium that could essentially be scheduled out to only a few weeks? Do you find that you have the time it takes to truly &#8220;design&#8221; original sounds for the films you score?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="plus-one-wrap"><g:plusone size="medium" href="../../../2010/10/deane-ogden-tools-for-studio-organization.html"></g:plusone></div><p>Today&#8217;s composer has to be someone who can balance writing a perfect score with both the business and logistical sides of the gig. We have to manage studios, accounts, relationships, finances, and the myriad other details that enable us to do what we do. The key to it is creating the perfect environment that will help you be as effective as possible in doing so.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I HATE clutter. I heard once that &#8220;You cannot be creative and tidy at the same time,&#8221; and while that might be true for some people, for me it just doesn&#8217;t work. I need a clean space every morning to get started in, even if I&#8217;m smack in the middle of a project or a cue. Similarly, I cannot stand to leave my studio in disarray when I leave it at night. It makes me feel as though I haven&#8217;t gotten anything done, even if I&#8217;ve hit my minute goal for the day. If things are out of order, I don&#8217;t feel accomplished. I don&#8217;t get there every single day, but I certainly try to, otherwise the next day begins off-kilter.</p>
<p>To achieve this, I&#8217;ve developed what I feel is an efficient system for staying organized and keeping things humming. My criteria for this system is that it must be:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Easy to use</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Self-organizing</em></strong>, and</li>
<li><strong><em>Available at all times</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>These days, aside from sketching out cues, not much goes down on paper, and what does (receipts, incoming invoices, etc.) gets scanned and filed onto an external hard drive every month. To handle everything else, though, I&#8217;ve relied heavily on some really useful digital tools to help keep my studio neat and free of clutter. Each of these tools are completely free and easy to use. Additionally, all of them are software-based and can be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" target="_blank">cloud-contained</a> with a little jerry-rigging on your part.</p>
<p>_________________________</p>
<p><strong>NOTATIONAL VELOCITY</strong> (Platform: Mac; $/free)<br />
(<a href="http://notational.net/" target="_blank">http://notational.net/</a>)</p>
<p>I get a lot of ideas. Musical ideas, SCOREcast ideas, ideas for my team, business ideas, and ideas for things that need attention from the other roles in my life. I need somewhere to organize and index all of those ideas. Back in the day, I carried around a <a href="http://www.mead.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product3_10051_10006_124767_-1_false_10051" target="_blank">Mead Composition Book</a> to keep all of these ideas in, with dates in the margins to index the pertinent info for later retrieval. However, now I&#8217;ve discovered a great digital tool called <a href="http://notational.net/" target="_blank">Notational Velocity</a>. Notational Velocity is a killer application for the Mac that lets you easily enter notes in a self-organizing way where the concept of &#8220;searching&#8221; is not a function of the program, but its entire interface. You can store anything in Notational Velocity from a text snippet to any file type that you have stored on your computer. I write all of my SCOREcast posts in Notational Velocity and I am writing my book in it as well. I also write down thoughts as they come to me, reminders</p>
<div id="attachment_915" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/10/NV_screenshot1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-915" title="NV_screenshot" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/10/NV_screenshot1-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Deane&#39;s Notational Velocity interface</p></div>
<p>about events, and details about meetings I take. Notational Velocity organizes each of these &#8220;notes&#8221; in an alphabetized database that is stored within the application.</p>
<p>For you iPhone and iPad users, Notational Velocity syncs seamlessly with another free application called <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com/" target="_blank">SimpleNote</a>. SimpleNote is a small footprint iPhone/iPad app that does the exact same thing Notational Velocity does, in almost exactly the same way. The cool thing is that these two independent companies have decided to work together to make the mobile experience easy for those of us that want to keep our note database with us at all times. SimpleNote is also free, and only requires that you  register a free account in order to allow it to sync with Notational Velocity over the cloud.</p>
<p>The best thing about Notational Velocity is that it is fast and easy to bring up, whether you are on your computer or your iPhone/iPad. Both Notational Velocity and SimpleNote sync upon shutdown, and the sync is instantaneous, so you never have to worry about things being mirrored on either platform. With both of these free (!) apps active in your workflow, your notes are always with you when you need them. You&#8217;ll never lose an idea again!</p>
<p>_________________________</p>
<p><strong>GOOGLE DOCS</strong> (Platform: agnostic; $/free)<br />
(<a href="https://docs.google.com" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com</a>)</p>
<p>I love Google. I think they are one of the only companies that are really working hard, daily, to make the enterprise user as happy as possible. My only gripe is that Google and Apple can&#8217;t get along and play in the same sandbox; MobileMe is cool, but it doesn&#8217;t come close to doing what <a href="https://docs.google.com" target="_blank">GoogleDocs</a> can do&#8230; for free. Fact is, if you want to get the paper part of your business online, <a href="https://docs.google.com" target="_blank">GoogleDocs</a> is the way to do it.</p>
<div id="attachment_913" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/10/googledocs.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-913  " style="margin: 0px; border: 0pt none;" title="googledocs" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/10/googledocs-300x181.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="181" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;The Musicave&quot; GoogleDocs menu</p></div>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com" target="_blank">GoogleDocs</a> is an online suite of word processing and spreadsheet applications that is accessible by simply registering for a free Google ID. If you use Gmail (which I also highly recommend—you can easily funnel all of your POP 3 email accounts through Google&#8217;s Gmail interface), then you are already there.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve pretty much put <em>everything</em> on GoogleDocs: all of my accounts receivable/payable, all HR resources for leading my staff (personnel documents, tax forms, NDAs), intern to-do lists, and critical business documents (studio inventory, software serial numbers, orchestra rosters, etc.). You can see by the graphic to the right that I have a lot of things shared with my interns and my assistant. In the GoogleDocs menu, you can choose to share any file with anyone, whether they have a Google account ID or not. In addition, the newest version of GoogleDocs allows you to also upload and store other file types for storage such as .PDFs, Apple Pages documents, graphics files (JPEG, GIF, PNG, and TIF), and Word and Excel formatted documents. My employee handbook that I go over with everyone who joins my team at the Musicave is formatted in a PDF and stored in my &#8220;Staff&#8221; folder in GoogleDocs. My &#8220;Staff&#8221; folder, as well as several other folders, allow me to keep things tidy within the menu, and I can easily share entire folders of documents with anyone I wish. I can also color-code folders and files/documents to help distinguish which groups of people I&#8217;ve shared certain items with.</p>
<p>In theory, you could put your whole scoring workflow online with GoogleDocs. If I sound a little bit ridiculous about this service, it&#8217;s because it has essentially changed the way I do everything at the Musicave. It makes group collaboration a snap, and keeps everyone on my team in sync with where we are at any given moment.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve written about a few programs that I&#8217;ve used to keep track of <a href="../../../2009/07/roadmapping-score.html" target="_blank">scoring workflow before</a>. However, that was back when I was just getting out of the habit of using an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of everything as I scored, and things have progressed a little since then.</p>
<p>Cue Log manager and Cue Chronicle are still very relevant programs to use for keeping your scoring crew in sync (and I highly recommend you checking out BOTH), but there is now another alternative that I&#8217;ve recently come across called <a href="http://www.cuetracker.com/" target="_blank">Cue Tracker</a>, written and programmed by a cat named Sean Dougall who has assisted for some of the best composers in the business. Cue Tracker is awesomely simple and refreshingly easy to use. It is Mac only (sorry, PC peeps!), and I will say that it is a little more useful than Cue Log Manager but a little easier to comprehend than Cue Chronicle—it kind of falls squarely in the middle of the two as a nice middle-of-the-road alternative.</p>
<p>One of the coolest things about Cue Tracker is that you can easily customize the way in which each person on your team can view information. In addition to that, Cue Tracker has several routine templates built-in that can be turned into viewable screensets. You can choose everything from spotting notes, cue  status reports, take logs, mix logs, cue sheets, and many, many more. It is a snap to print out any of these screensets as reports or save them as PDFs, HTML markup snippets, or simple RTF documents. The screensets are a cool function because very often I don&#8217;t need my music editor seeing all of my notes back and forth to my orchestrators or the orchestrators&#8217; notes to the copyists. By customizing those screensets, you are able to provide each person with only the info they need in order to do their jobs.</p>
<p>The only drawback to Cue Tracker is that it is the one tool on this list that does not natively support real-time syncing. Dougall says that he is working on &#8220;server-sync&#8221; as an upcoming feature in a future release, but he&#8217;s been saying that for a little while now. However, if you are a <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> user, you can just as easily drop the application&#8217;s &#8220;Content&#8221; folder (right click on the app in your Finder) into <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> and use that file to sync with every other person that you need to have access to the central project file. Incidentally, this method also works with Cue Log Manager, so if you need to sync with someone else you can do it pretty seamlessly this way.<br />
_________________________</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the deal: I&#8217;ve auditioned and then ditched a lot of tools to get to the simple and effective ones I&#8217;ve landed on here. These might not be for everybody, and yet you might figure out a way to use them better than I have. Whatever the case, I&#8217;d love to hear <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>YOUR</em></span> recommendations for things that would either better these or ways that they can be used in better fashion to get us all up and running effectively and organizationally.</p>

Nothing will give your music heart, soul, the real human touch, better than the sounds of skilled musicians. Even if you yourself are the finest, with years of experience, even adding just one pro player will double your firepower, and even casual listeners will notice.</p>
<p>So, now that you are off the phone and someone is on his or her way, it&#8217;s time to think about just how to interact for the best possible results. This is where you will be called on to put on your &#8220;producer&#8221; hat. Let&#8217;s talk about what that entails.</p>
<p><strong>Producers In Different Music Types</strong><br />
Most of us are aware of the job of producer, or at least that most professional music projects require one. In the case of pop album artists, the producer is often someone different than the artist, a specialist who may have many years of experience and credits with a variety of performers. As the overall guide and leader of a project, the producer starts at the beginning with an artist with some sort of raw talent, and sees the recording project all the way to the successful delivery of a finished master recording. Along the way, he or she is called to be a scheduler, accountant, arranger, songwriter or writing partner, guide to the technical details of the studio process, psychologist and counselor, negotiator, liaison with the client (record company, etc.) supervisor of the artists and musicians who may perform, player/programmer, overseer of mixing, and (hopefully) all-round highly skilled musician with the ability and experience to see the project through to its completed stage.</p>
<p>Like I said, in the record industry, that person is often a hired specialist, separate from the artist. In the score music business, that person is generally &#8230; YOU, the composer.</p>
<p>What are some of the issues you&#8217;ll need to keep your eyes and ears on as a guest musician performs on your score? Some examples:</p>
<p><strong>Being Prepared</strong><br />
Obviously you&#8217;ll start with some idea of how long you want the musician to work, and how many cues you want played. (This has a lot to do with budget, of course.) In order to make the best use of time, you want to make sure that you have well-copied, legible music written out. Even if you intend to record an improvised part, a simple chart with bar numbers, sections indicated, and chord changes, will help everybody navigate. If you&#8217;re not sure about your copyist skills, it&#8217;s worth asking a friend to help or at least proofread. One of the most unnecessary and disastrous time wasters is for a musician to try to make sense out of a part that is illegible, poorly formatted, or contains mistakes.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t just assume that, since your sequencing program has a notation printing function, that it will automatically come out good enough. I have yet to see software automatically format the chart in the best professional way; some hands-on manipulating always makes it better. If you&#8217;re not sure what real professional copying is supposed to look like, that&#8217;s a topic that might be worth looking for at a local school of music. Just because copying now is almost always done with software rather than pen and ink, doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s an obsolete skill — formatting and layout make a big difference. Or, like I said, get some help.</p>
<p><strong>How Long Will It Take?</strong><br />
Once your musicians are on the clock, you&#8217;ll want to make the most efficient use of time possible. Ahead of time, you might want to plan out how many minutes of music, or how many cues, you would like to get accomplished each hour. For orchestral recording, the music union has guidelines of how many minutes of music should be recorded per hour, so that at least gives a general notion to start with. It takes some experience to learn to set realistic goals with this sort of thing, so how do you get started? Just dive in, and take meticulous notes, and you&#8217;ll learn. If things are moving more quickly than you expect, then great; if they&#8217;re going slower than you hoped, try to figure out why. Are the charts playable? Are they neatly copied? Are they in the comfortable range of the instrument? And is this particular player capable of doing what you were hoping? Figuring out how to assess all these factors is part of the learning process.</p>
<p>Take notes and keep records! One producer/composer I work with has over 30 years experience in recording the best players and singers, but to this day he still carefully writes down in a database exactly what happened and how long it took with each musician&#8217;s name and with each project. There&#8217;s no way everything can always be perfectly predictable, but the more you do it, the better you&#8217;ll have a sense of what to expect, and as your knowledge increases you&#8217;ll be able to confidently tackle bigger projects.</p>
<p><strong>Judging Performance Quality: When Is It Good Enough?</strong><br />
From my chair as engineer, over the years I&#8217;ve observed a lot of producers, and made my own (private) judgments. I&#8217;ve seen some be simply too picky, redoing little things when it was already good enough, which can drain the energy and enthusiasm out of musicians. Others (perhaps a bit intimidated by the process) might leave things a little more sloppy than necessary. It&#8217;s okay to ask for a retake if you think it can or must be a better performance. Often a savvy and helpful musician will say &#8220;I think I can do that better; how about saving that and then giving me another chance?&#8221; And especially with improvising, you might want to save more than one choice, and pick or comp later. Today with digital recording, there are basically infinite numbers of tracks. But (maybe from my past experience with analog tape) I never think it&#8217;s worthwhile to save garbage. Judge as you go along; why wait to sort through tons of stuff later?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget, there such a thing as musician fatigue. Both the chops and the brain get tired, and it&#8217;s standard practice to give a 10-minute break each hour. And at some point every musician will be &#8220;cooked&#8221; for the day. Especially with a passage that might be difficult, even the finest musician might say, &#8220;I have one or two of these in me; make sure you get it recorded well!&#8221; Never embarrass yourself by having to admit that the perfect take was distorted or you forgot to hit &#8220;save&#8221;. (Too much to think about to produce and also mind the technicalities of recording? Let me tell you about a full-time highly skilled professional specialist called a Recording Engineer&#8230;)</p>
<p><strong>Singers and Vocals</strong><br />
Although it&#8217;s somewhat less likely for a composer to use a singer on a score than in other types of music, it&#8217;s often done, and worthy of special mention. There&#8217;s something very intimate about the act of singing into a microphone. It seems especially emotional, and singers wear their hearts on their sleeves. It really takes a bit of a psychologist to get the best performance out of anybody, but especially a singer. Don&#8217;t forget, one of the most important things you can do is dish out praise, even when you&#8217;re not quite sure it&#8217;s deserved. You don&#8217;t want to come across like a phony-baloney, but you do want to convince performers that you&#8217;re there for them, and create an environment where they will feel safe doing their best and giving their all.</p>
<p>Even singers who read well (and not all do) have an element of improvising in expressive performance. Don&#8217;t be so hung up on your previously imagined ideas, or the way you would sing it if you could, that you fail to recognize something unexpected that might be great. One time I was there (keeping my mouth shut) while one of the most powerful producers in the business, a name you&#8217;d recognize immediately, reduced a fine singer to tears by rejecting everything he did, and instead singing his own version into the talkback mic over and over. Even though that man has written some of the best pop songs ever, I lost respect for him, because of his poor people skills in that situation. Keep your ears wide open, and don&#8217;t forget that one of the reasons you&#8217;ve hired great musicians or singers is to collaborate with them, and to get their best ideas for your music.</p>
<p><strong>Cutting Your Losses / Heroic Saves</strong><br />
Okay, sometimes it&#8217;s just not happening. I once watched a composer valiantly trying to get the right kind of loping easy country feel on a fiddle melody. One after another, several players took a stab at it, were politely thanked (and paid), and then, after they left, I was told to erase their parts while he frantically phoned the next one. If this happens, yes, you&#8217;ll take a bit of a bath, but you&#8217;ll also learn something, and it won&#8217;t be your last time ever producing a soloist or having money to spend.</p>
<p>Of course we&#8217;ve got a lot of tools in our computers these days that can help turn a marginal performance into an acceptable one, and maybe even a great one. As a matter of principle, I hate Autotune, but it&#8217;s a devil we all live with these days, put to use cleaning up performances both ordinary and even superlative. For example, a good studio singer can usually get a track in two or three passes — the first is for reading and learning, and then the emotion kicks in and you better have the machine in record. Then if you say, “That&#8217;s great but the last two notes were flat”, then they start thinking too much and lose the spark. Better to just tune it up a bit. (Yes, I&#8217;ve gone over to the dark side, with the rest of you!)</p>
<p>Likewise, digital editing and even quantizing of rhythmic parts are possible in almost all the major software packages. But, if you&#8217;re on a deadline, hopefully you won&#8217;t have to spend all night cleaning a part that should have been done right to start with!</p>
<p><strong>How To Learn</strong><br />
One of the best ways to get an idea of what it&#8217;s like to work with studio musicians, either in a studio or home setting, is to get a chance to watch someone else do it. This is where it comes in handy to be in touch with other working composers — ask around and see if someone will let you be a &#8220;fly on the wall&#8221; in one of their sessions. Or, better yet, find some way to help: set up person, copyist, make tea, etc.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in the Los Angeles area, a good organization that offers some of these kinds of observing and mentoring experiences is the <a href="http://www.thescl.com/" target="_blank">Society of Composers and Lyricists</a>. Their &#8220;<a href="http://thescl.com/mentor_program" target="_blank">Mentor Program</a>&#8221; offers young composers a chance to sit in on sessions with working composers, observe, and ask questions.</p>
<p>By fortunate coincidence, the annual meeting of the SCL is coming up very soon, Wednesday evening October 6, 2010, in Hollywood. See the website for more details. For those attending, the price of admission will be credited towards annual dues if you sign up, and there is a discount rate for students. And you’re likely to meet at least one <em>SCOREcaster</em> there. Don&#8217;t miss it!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="plus-one-wrap"><g:plusone size="medium" href="../../../2010/05/les-brockmann-it-hurts-to-work-the-musicians-silent-epidemic.html"></g:plusone></div><p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sig-brockmann.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-530" title="sig-brockmann" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sig-brockmann.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>There’s an epidemic going on that no one wants to talk about. Lots of people in our business are hurting, and computer work is the main culprit.</p>
<p>One composer I know says every bone and joint in her body hurts all the time. She is saving up for a hydraulic lifter for her keyboard and computer workstation, so she can vary her position, working standing up as well as seated. Another I know has intense shoulder pain, and can’t raise his arm above shoulder level. He doesn’t want his clients to know, because he’s afraid they will think he can’t do the work.</p>
<p>The first person I ever heard of who injured his hands trying to become a better musician was the composer Robert Schumann. In trying to develop increased finger independence at the piano, he famously immobilized his fourth fingers with a length of string and ended up crippling his hands. It’s said that this motivated him to turn to composition.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he wasn’t the last person that ever hurt himself creating music. It’s estimated that as many as a third of symphony and studio musicians will at some point in their career deal with pain or injuries to the hands. It’s very common to deny or conceal these problems, for fear of getting a reputation for being disabled and losing work.</p>
<p>In today’s world the job of composer is not a haven from such injuries. Intensive computer use, combined with the pressures of huge workloads and deadlines, can lead to serious problems if one isn’t careful. Many fail to recognize the problem until it is too late.</p>
<h4>DO I HAVE CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME?</h4>
<p>I recently discussed this situation with Laura Stewart, president of Wellspring Therapy of Glendale. In the 20 years she has been an occupational therapist and certified hand therapist, she has gained a reputation as one of the foremost authorities on treatment and recovery from injuries of the hand. She stresses that the absolute most important thing about dealing with this sort of injury is to prevent it from happening in the first place; we’ll get to that in a moment.</p>
<p>But what if you’re already feeling a twinge, how can you find out more about it? The news media, in simplifying things for mass consumption, have led us to believe that anything that goes wrong with the hands must be carpal tunnel syndrome. But in reality, there are a number of different things that can go wrong with your hands, wrists, arms and shoulders. Most common are carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, and osteoarthritis. Here’s a simple way to tell the difference:</p>
<p><strong>Carpal tunnel syndrome:</strong> Between the bones of your wrist, there are several tiny tunnels through which tendons and nerves must pass. Repetition of a motion with hands or fingers can cause swelling of the tendons that make the fingers move, constricting the nerves that share the carpal tunnel. Symptoms of this include numbness, tingling, pain that resembles a burning feeling in the hands, and eventual weakness of hands and fingers.</p>
<p>If this is your problem, you may feel numbness and tingling on the inside half of your hand, that is the thumb, index, middle, and the inside half of your ring finger. Why? Because the nerves that lead to those figures go through the carpal tunnel. Nerves that go to other parts of the hand go through other tunnels in the wrist.</p>
<p><strong>Tendinitis:</strong> Tendinitis is inflammation of the tendons in the hand, wrist, and forearm that attach muscles to the bones. Symptoms are primarily pain and decrease in movement; this problem seldom causes numbness.</p>
<p><strong>Osteoarthritis:</strong> This form of arthritis (not to be confused with rheumatoid arthritis, which is not included in this discussion) is often associated with aging, but can happen to people of any age. It is caused by the deterioration of the cartilage between the bones, the pad surfaces that cushion their intersections. Of the three types of injury, this type can most easily be diagnosed using X-rays.</p>
<h4>STEERING CLEAR OF DANGER</h4>
<p>Repetitive motion injuries can be serious and very painful, and can even threaten your career. There are ways to avoid these problems, or mitigate them if you’re already having some trouble, but it often can be difficult. It often takes very substantial changes in work habits, physical fitness, and even attitudes towards the work you do — real life changes.</p>
<p>High pressure and tight deadlines aren’t the only reason one can develop this sort of problem. Composers and other creative people are often very highly motivated, even to the point of being obsessive. It’s a rush and a thrill when a good piece of music takes shape, and one can lose track of the hours fine-tuning and tweaking the sounds with the mouse and keyboard. Later you finally come up for air and then, “Ouch!”  The pain and other symptoms are often delayed.</p>
<p>The body wasn’t designed to do the same small repetitive tasks for an extended time, and the equipment isn’t always designed to help the body in the best way. Here are few tips on how to work smart and prevent injuries; they may look familiar, but are worth thinking about again:</p>
<p><strong>Good ergonomics and posture:</strong> You must be able to reach your computer keyboard and mouse without straining. A good keyboard workstation should have a computer keyboard tray that is adjustable in its height and angle. As you sit up straight and reach for the keys, your elbows should not be bent at an angle tighter than 90 degrees. That is, make sure your chair is high enough and your keyboard is low enough that you’re not reaching up to the keyboard or mouse. Try to always hold your wrists straight and even, in a neutral position, never arched nor sunk down nor twisted sideways. Try to relax your shoulders; tension can make them rise up toward your ears. And make sure your screen is high enough that you don’t have to hunch or slump — a good rule of thumb: sit up straight in front of your screen; the top one-fourth of its area should be at about eye level and three-fourths below.</p>
<p>Reality check: What do we do about a workstation that also has a MIDI controller keyboard? For good playing technique the MIDI keys need to be at a proper height as well; a grand piano usually has its key tops at approximately 27- 28 in. Some people are more comfortable with a tray for the computer keyboard that is down low underneath the piano keys, perhaps on a sliding track, and some place the computer keyboard on top of the MIDI keys. It may also work to have the computer keyboard and mouse off to one side. Some trial and error may be necessary. But watch out for extremes — I know one composer who had his Macintosh keyboard down at the very far left-hand end of the 88-key controller, and the track ball to the right at the opposite end. His work position had him splayed out like he was on a cross, a real recipe for back, shoulder, and hand pain. Ow!</p>
<p>It’s also important to get a good adjustable chair that is the right size for you. Make sure it has good lumbar (lower back) support, and if there are armrests they should be adjusted low enough that they don’t make you hunch your shoulders or get in the way when you play music. Even though various wrist pads are popular, most physical therapist strongly advise that you don’t rest your wrists or arms while you type or work the mouse; it’s important that the large muscles of the arms and shoulders are used to support the hands and fingers, and that you have some flexibility to move your body as you work.</p>
<p><strong>Keep fit.</strong> A sedentary lifestyle can lead you to getting hurt much more easily. Think of yourself as a “hand athlete” — if you did that much continual work with your legs, such as running, you would understand the need for good fitness throughout your body. Therapists often recommend cardiovascular exercise and weight training (although if you are already hurting don’t just start lifting weights without guidance!). And, as with any athletic workout, a start with a warm-up and stretches, including your hands, is always wise.</p>
<p><strong>Keep your tools sharp.</strong> Just as it takes many more pounds of force to cut up a chicken with a dull knife than with a sharp one, computer tools that are stiff or worn out can make your work harder than it needs to be. The tiny movements that you do over and over with your hands should be made as easy as possible for them. Little bits add up! I recently sat down at a composer’s workstation and found the track ball to be so rough and stiff that it practically took two hands to move it. A good-quality trackball should glide with only a feather-light touch. Sometimes they need cleaning or lubrication or just replacing. Your fingers will thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Take breaks and break up your tasks.</strong> When we get obsessed, or on a deadline, it’s easy to lose track of time. Taking regular breaks, even if it’s just to get up and stretch and walk around the room for five minutes, is essential. And if you’ve got more than one job on your to-do list, it’s better to do a little bit of one and then a little bit of the next rather than to power through on just one task.</p>
<h4>TOOLS THAT CAN HELP</h4>
<p>There are lots of “ergonomic” keyboards and other accessories out there. Different people get good results from different things. Here are a few accessories that many find useful:</p>
<p><strong>Kensington Turbo Mouse:</strong> This is a large (2&#8243;) trackball. Its broad size helps you keep your hand in more of a flat position, which can help avoid pain. Also, the four or more buttons (depending upon the model) can be programmed to common actions such as click-hold (drag), double-click, etc. (Avoid the wireless model.) Many people find that a traditional mouse can cause stress and tension in their arms and shoulders, due to the fact that a lot of work you do dragging things around on the screen involves holding down the button and so your arm is continually tensed. Instead, you can momentarily click a click-hold button, then lightly roll the ball to make the edit or other drag, and then click again to release. I’m often surprised by people who don’t bother to program the buttons and get accustomed to them — give it a try; once you get the hang of it you will find that it helps a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Kinesis programmable USB foot switch (<a href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/">Kinesis-Ergo.com</a>):</strong> The 3 foot pedals can be programmed to duplicate any button on your mouse or keyboard. If your hands are tired of all the clicking this can help. (It can also come in handy as a “record” foot switch for punching yourself in and out.)</p>
<p><strong>Voice-recognition software:</strong> The best one I have found for Macintosh is Dictate from MacSpeech/Nuance. It’s not perfect but there’s not much else to choose from. (This article was written using it.) If you use a Windows machine, Dragon Naturally-Speaking is said to be quite good. Unfortunately these are only useful for writing tasks such as word-processing and e-mail; they’re not much help in most music software.</p>
<h4>FOR MORE INFORMATION</h4>
<p><strong>The book to get:</strong> This may well be the most important part of this article. If you’re having pain or other problems with your hands, or just want to learn more so that you can avoid such problems, an essential book is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Repetitive- Strain-Injury-Computer- Users/dp/0471595330/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1274545599&amp;sr=8-1">“Repetitive Strain Injury: A Computer User’s Guide”</a> by Emil Pascarelli, M.D., and Deborah Quilter. This contains an absolute wealth of information about hand physiology, ergonomics, managing pain, and how to deal with medical help if you need it.</p>
<p><strong>Doctors and physical therapists:</strong> Not all physicians are aware of or trained in repetitive hand injuries, and you may have to work to get your insurance to cover it. In the Los Angeles area, there are physical therapy clinics that specialize in this type of rehabilitation; some research will help you find one that might work for you.</p>
<p><strong>RSI support groups:</strong> Many cities have support groups that meet regularly, in public libraries or other places, and offer informed speakers, suggested resources, and folks to commiserate with. An internet search may find resources in your community.</p>

As I’ve been working on project after project, I’ve put a lot of thought into getting to that final phase as smoothly as possible for both myself and the client by looking at the entire process leading up to deadline and delivery. Something that has remained true about the process on most of the projects I’ve worked on is, it’s never done ‘til it’s done.</p>
<p>On many, in fact most, of the projects I work on, there will be some sort of final, last tweaks that happen just before it goes off to the dub stage, while the film is being mixed, or even right before the final mix gets printed and delivered to theaters. We hear stories of this all the time. My solution, along with my process of mixing-as-I-go, has been to have a unifying tool that can facilitate every aspect of my process thus keeping the final mix of the score within this one program.</p>
<p>For me, it’s Cubase. Most everything happens in Cubase for me, except the picture, which is housed in Pro Tools along with any dialogue/sfx/temp music cues. I have all my writing templates in Cubase, I do all my writing in Cubase, I record a lot of my &#8220;sounds&#8221; and final instruments in Cubase, I’ll add my own effects and plug-ins in Cubase as I go along, and when everything is finalized, I have my engineer come in and he does the final mix in Cubase. Heck, I’ve even thrown in an extra step in between me working on it and presenting the cue to the director. I’m very blessed to have my engineer working in the same building as I do, so before I present my demo to any client, I’ll have him come in to take a listen, maybe do a few tweaks on some sounds; not a full blown mix, but just to touch things up a bit, sonically. I do this to try and keep everything that the client hears as close to my original intention and close to what it will end up sounding like as possible (excluding our tweaks of course). As we all know, the quality of the demos we present on any project is a very crucial part of the process, and as my engineer and I have been working together on most of my films, we have a good mixing/working relationship where I know how he likes things prepped and he knows where I tend to go with a specific sound. When I’m presenting something, it really is the joint collaboration between him and myself, and it is very similar to how the score will end up sounding.</p>
<p>Remaining open until the very end has become a convention that is expected and required in today’s industry and, with all this technology at our disposal, it has made it a lot easier to uphold. I recently found an interesting interview with composer Klaus Badelt on his French film <em>Le Petit Nicholas</em> in which he describes a similar process where everything for him from the writing, recording to mixing happens in Logic. Everyone has their own preference, but the main concept remains very similar.</p>
<p>There are numerous of my own examples where we have been able to cater to last minute changes due to our work flow of having everything living within one program. However, this does not mean that I do not employ the use of other programs for specific purposes. Sometimes I use Ableton Live, Logic, Pro Tools, etc. but my main tool remains in one. On a psychological thriller I did, <em>Dark Woods</em>, we had delivered the final 5.1 mix of the score to the dub stage and I got a call a week or so later from the director asking if we could do some final tweaks. There were some musical/sonic elements I had done in some of the cues that he wanted in more scenes than we had originally spotted/written them to. So with all the midi/sound bytes/ audio stems/mixes there in front of me, I was able to be very flexible with the changes and it ended up helping the film flow better as well.</p>
<p>On a comedy drama (<em>Phil Cobb’s Dinner for Four</em>) I just recently finished, we revisited the score after several months of re-editing/color-grading to see where we were at and becauseI had everything right in front of me, it made it very easy to execute any changes or additions required. There was a lot of referral to the original suite I had written for the film and some segments we had originally deemed unfitting to the film ended up in several key moments of the film.</p>
<p>So with the increasingly shorter amount of time in which to deliver a score, does that change certain aspects of our process? How can we keep our doors open until the very end and still keep everyone sane and happy? What are your thoughts and experiences on this?</p>

Although every project is a little bit different, there are some standard procedures, and we&#8217;ll go over them, with some definitions, a few precautions, and one or two minefields.<span id="more-299"></span></p>
<p>Before I get started, it&#8217;s a good time to remind you that it&#8217;s always a good idea to ask your clients what their delivery requirements are. If the producer or director can’t tell you directly, they will refer you to a post production mixer or technician who will have all the answers.<br />
<a href="../../../2009/09/technical-guidelines-for-film-and-tv.html"><br />
In a past article</a>, I&#8217;ve gone over standard digital file issues, such as sample rate and bit depth. Review if needed. Of course you will be delivering finished mixes (or sometimes &#8220;stems&#8221;), not raw unmixed instrument tracks.</p>
<p>Since most postproduction work is done using ProTools, you will probably be asked to deliver in either a ProTools &#8220;session&#8221; file or at least something that&#8217;s easily imported into ProTools. Some composers are already equipped with ProTools software and hardware, but I wouldn&#8217;t say most are. So you might say, &#8220;Well, if I have to turn in something in ProTools, then how about if I just get a little cheap ProTools LE system?&#8221; But there&#8217;s a hitch — unlike its (expensive!) big brother ProTools HD, the LE systems do not support timecode, unless you pay extra for &#8220;post-production toolkit&#8221; features.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s pause for a moment and review what our intent is here: you have prepared each piece of music to go at exactly a certain spot in the film, usually defined by a timecode starting number. Just because you are viewing the video in your DAW software (Logic, DP, etc.) doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that the music will automatically go to the right place on the dubstage; someone needs to place it there in their DAW software, i.e. ProTools. An important distinction is that when you are in &#8220;composing work mode&#8221; you will have each piece of music in a separate file or chunk, but for the dub mix they will all need to be in one common &#8220;session&#8221; file.</p>
<p>For several years I&#8217;ve worked with composer Greg Edmonson on the show <em>King of the Hill</em> (Fox TV), and after the composing process in Logic, part of my job was to put all the mixes into ProTools for delivery. Here in brief is my workflow for that:</p>
<p>Each cue was mixed in Logic and then exported as a 24-bit 48K WAV file (either one interleaved stereo file or two mono files will work equally well, but stay tuned for one small hitch in this process). Then in ProTools HD those files were imported onto tracks, one at a time, and &#8220;spotted&#8221; to the right start location by timecode. It&#8217;s pretty common as I mix for the file I create to not start at bar 1 beat 1, but before, to accommodate instruments which may attack slightly early — so it&#8217;s important to keep a list of timecode starts for each file, which may be a different number than the music downbeat.</p>
<p>I usually use two stereo tracks (or sets of tracks), and alternate odd-numbered and even-numbered cues. This allows for any cues that may overlap each other at the start/end. Sometimes there is an additional track as well for source cues, which may be overlength.<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
No ProTools?</span><br />
So that&#8217;s pretty basic, but as I mentioned before, what if you don&#8217;t have a timecode version of ProTools? That&#8217;s when it pays to really know your clients, and figure out how to accommodate their needs. Some of my composer clients are able to simply deliver a folder of stereo files, with a list of timecode start numbers. There may be an editor who is willing to take a few minutes to drop the music in the right places. On a higher-budget gig that might actually be an official Music Editor, a professional who can be a tremendous help to a composer in many ways. Sadly, they are rare in lower-budget projects.</p>
<p>My colleague Randy Knaub writes about the <a href="../../../2010/04/randy-knaub-better-delivery-with-omf.html">use of OMF and AAF file formats</a>, and I&#8217;ll leave it to him to explain this. This allows you to use some other DAW software to create a file which should be compatible with ProTools. I have just a couple of reservations about this: if you do deliver this way then it&#8217;s important to have someone &#8220;on the premises&#8221; check the work and make sure everything has ended up in the right place. I would avoid any edits, punch-ins, fades, and automation. Those are not appropriate in a score delivery anyway. Also, in the ProTools world, the ability to open and accommodate these files is a paid option (and somewhat expensive depending on your point of view — another nice Digi/Avid wallet zinger), so check in advance to see whether your client can accommodate this.<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
Time stamping</span><br />
One thing that will help your music to go in exactly the right place is to use files that are time stamped. Most DAW apps can create and accommodate file time stamping. Then in ProTools the file can be easily spotted automatically to the intended location, avoiding the tedium of typing in all the numbers.</p>
<p>Digital Performer automatically and reliably adds time stamping to any WAV file, when your project file is set to the correct time start number and you record in real time. However, annoyingly, Logic will not. (Yes, I know they say it will, but I found that sometimes it correctly timestamps a WAV file and sometimes it doesn&#8217;t, with no predictable rhyme or reason. It&#8217;s a bug that has existed since Logic 6 or before; I’ve found this with more than one client under a variety of circumstances. In repeated inquiries I have found Logic tech support and local reps had no clue why and didn&#8217;t seem much interested. Ideas?)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">File types NOT to use</span><br />
In previous articles I discussed file types, but it&#8217;s worth mentioning again that some computer compatible file types are not appropriate for professional production work: MP3 and AAC. These &#8220;lossy&#8221; file types are intentionally &#8220;shrunk&#8221; in order to make them easier to e-mail or transfer quickly through the Internet, but this is done by intentionally throwing away part of the sound data.</p>
<p>If you need to deliver over the Internet, this is a good place to use FTP or an iDisk; don&#8217;t compromise the music you&#8217;ve worked hard on by then compressing it to e-mail it. If you&#8217;re placing a piece of music downloaded from a service like iTunes, try to get an original copy CD instead, and extract an AIFF file from that.</p>
<p>It really makes a substantial difference in how good things sound. Maybe it’s a hassle, but if you are going to be committed to working hard to making your music sound great, then why not have those elements as good as they can be as well?</p>
<p>This may be a situation in which you educate your client as well. Suppose they ask you to send an MP3, or maybe send you one of some source music. On little speakers on a computer it probably doesn’t sound any different. But I promise you on the loudspeakers in a dubstage, or after broadcast processing, the difference in richness and punch will be substantial. Plus if there needs to be editing or EQ then an uncompressed file will respond better to that, with less deterioration. Like blowing up a photograph really big—do you see lots of blurry mushy pixels or is it detailed and focused even at large magnification?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fight the bad</span><br />
For a variety of reasons, I hear a lot of music that doesn&#8217;t sound as good as I think it could or should, especially on television, sorry to say it. I know there are a lot of challenges.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all heard, and probably said, &#8220;It&#8217;s good enough for&#8230;&#8221;. Fill in the blank — For TV. For no money. For an impossible deadline. For those @#$%s who made me stay up all night to do five rewrites.</p>
<p>My humble suggestion: Fight the temptation. If you insist on quality, from the smallest detail like avoiding MP3s, to everything else, all the way to the top of your professional and personal &#8220;food chain&#8221;, you will feel better about your work, and others will notice. Isn&#8217;t that how you want to be?</p>

As I began to write today&#8217;s article, though, I realized that our April focus itself is built on some assumptions. Those assumptions, and their ramifications, after the jump.<br />
<a name="more"></a>First, we&#8217;re assuming you actually have a gig. In other words, you actually succeeded in convincing a filmmaker that you&#8217;re worthy to collaborate with them on their project. This seems to be the toughest step for a lot of people, and we devote a significant amount of time here on SCOREcast to helping you achieve this goal. This month, though, that&#8217;s a given.</p>
<p>Second assumption: You&#8217;ve successfully threaded your way through the various pitfalls that accompany a typical scoring assignment. Anyone who&#8217;s been around for any length of time will tell you that&#8217;s not the easiest thing. You&#8217;re to be congratulated. Seriously.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve worked on a fair few projects that ended without any sort of closure—either the filmmakers decided they wanted to go in a different direction, or the show simply tanked. Either way, the process of &#8220;delivery and finaling&#8221; didn&#8217;t just grind to a halt—it ceased to exist altogether. And that&#8217;s something you should be prepared for, mentally and emotionally. This is a business, and no one in the executive ranks cares whether you achieve a warm and fuzzy feeling at the end of the workday.</p>
<p>Those are two <em>big</em> assumptions for us to make here at SCOREcast. And thanks for bearing with me through this tour of the obvious. Here&#8217;s the point—what <em>can&#8217;t</em> we assume?</p>
<p>The part we can&#8217;t assume is that what is being delivered—i.e., a musical cargo so precious, we&#8217;re spending an entire <em>month</em> just talking about how to deliver it safely, securely and properly organized!—is, in fact, worth anything. I mean, some of the procedures we&#8217;re outlining here are fairly involved and time-intensive… is your stuff really so good that it&#8217;s worth the time and hassle?</p>
<p>In order for you to consistently do a professional job of &#8220;putting the project to bed,&#8221; you have to believe, with passion and conviction, that the answer is <strong>yes</strong>. This phase of the game is no different than any other in that regard. If your score is &#8220;mailed in,&#8221; you might as well just… mail it in.</p>
<p>Just upload some mp3s to your iDisk. The guy cutting on the AVID (what&#8217;s his name again?) will figure out any formatting problems. 2-pop? No 2-pop? Who cares? They&#8217;ll probably move the cue around, or cut it up, or dump it, anyway.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time and effort in my articles talking about our process, our mental and psychological state as composers. Getting your inner game in the right place to do the job in all its phases.</p>
<p>In the particular phase we&#8217;re focusing on now, I think you can see all that airy talk actually starting to become useful (!). If you&#8217;re not convinced of the worth of your product, you won&#8217;t take the fussy-but-critical steps necessary to see that that product reaches its destination intact and in perfect shape.</p>
<p>And the bigger the project, the fussier and more critical those steps become. And so the more you have to believe. It&#8217;s <em>your</em> energy and commitment that drives the project to completion. As vital as your music team is to the success of a project, it&#8217;s ultimately you who has to be the impetus. If you want to change the world, even in the sometimes small and indirect way that&#8217;s within our power as film composers, you have to assume that burden.</p>
<p>So… with all that in mind, here are some final thoughts:<br />
1. You can start making a difference in the world any time you think you&#8217;re ready.<br />
2. If you believe what I just wrote, and if you believe in yourself, it&#8217;s generally better to start taking risks too early than too late.</p>
<p>…the rest is details. Granted, there are a lot of details (!), and a big part of what we&#8217;re about as a community is amassing the collective wisdom in order to get through those details in a smart way… but the Big Picture (and, despite the nuts-and-bolts title of my monthly column, I am at heart a Big-Picture kind of guy) is that we&#8217;re all playing for stakes.</p>
<p>Most people&#8217;s jobs allow them, at best, the opportunity to affect only a few grains of sand on the beach that is humanity. Maybe they can change those few grains profoundly… I&#8217;m not denigrating the importance of anyone&#8217;s chosen field of endeavor. But as partners in the storytelling enterprise, I think it&#8217;s important for us to keep in mind that we&#8217;re playing for the entire beach.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="plus-one-wrap"><g:plusone size="medium" href="../../../2010/04/weekend-provocation-delivery-vs-demo.html"></g:plusone></div><p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sig-sanders3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-768" title="sig-sanders" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sig-sanders3.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>Today&#8217;s Provocation strays ever so slightly off our April theme, but I hope you&#8217;ll follow along anyway. I&#8217;m going to lay out my some of my own ideas on turning <em>delivered</em> cues into <em>demo</em> cues. My overall opinion: if you want to put your best musical foot forward, there&#8217;s work to be done. Potentially <em>lots</em> of work.<br />
<a name="more"></a><br />
Let&#8217;s start here: when we&#8217;re delivering cues for a film mix, or even for network television, we tend to allow the dynamics to &#8220;breathe&#8221; much more than we would if we were producing them for an album release. In fact, I think the extra attention to mastering detail at the album stage is something that sets guys like Hans Zimmer and his Remote Control colleagues apart from many other established, respected composers… even A-list folks.</p>
<p>If you could hear, side by side, the album version and the &#8220;in-film&#8221; version of some of the Remote Control guys&#8217; scores, I suspect you&#8217;d notice <em>substantial</em> differences.</p>
<p>First off, the album-version cues are limited and tweaked to within an inch of their lives. The waveforms resemble what you&#8217;d see on commercial albums by recording artists… thick black blocks. A super-full sonic spectrum. This isn&#8217;t normally what you want to deliver to a dub stage—even in the fairly rare event you&#8217;re delivering full mixes in the first place.</p>
<p>So, for me, <strong>Step One is re-thinking the mix concept.</strong> That might mean going back to the original sequence file or Pro Tools session and starting more or less from scratch. In my view it&#8217;s worth it—the goal of what you&#8217;re creating at this stage is entirely different from its original purpose, so re-conceptualizing your mix makes a lot of sense. It also forces you to evaluate exactly which cues are worth the effort—sort of pre-selecting your favorites to go into the Demo Bin.</p>
<p>Along those same lines comes <strong>Step Two: editing for content.</strong> I think of a demo CD as a carnival ride… which the listener can get off of at any point. Your job is to keep them on that ride. Manipulate their attention span so that there&#8217;s something new and interesting every few seconds, while at the same time maintaining the overall musical integrity of the cue.</p>
<p>This is one of those areas where you can apply as much or as little time and energy as you have to spare. Honestly—by the time you experiment with different mixouts, different shapes, moving sections around in sequence, combining two or more cues into a single cue, etc., there are instances when you might as well start from scratch entirely (at least it often feels that way!).</p>
<p>Also, some cues just prove impervious to cutting. In those cases it&#8217;s time to make a command decision whether to accept the cue as-is or chuck it out of the Demo Bin entirely.</p>
<p>So… here&#8217;s one of the Big Questions people often debate: how long should a demo cue be? The answer is really a part of your own personal musical aesthetic—and I don&#8217;t know that, inside a certain reasonable musical-duration ballpark, there&#8217;s really a wrong answer. One of my own pet peeves is demos that contain only one loooong track (I&#8217;ve received a few). They&#8217;re gonna <em>make</em> me listen to that whole thing one way or another! Except, you know, I don&#8217;t. Filmmakers like to be able to fast forward if what they&#8217;re hearing isn&#8217;t interesting. It&#8217;s not a bad thing, I think, to give them the opportunity to do this (and thus to get to something they might like better!).</p>
<p>Next up: if your demo consists entirely of cues from a single project, you should take <strong>Step Three: considering track order</strong>, just as you would any other kind of demo CD. This may sound obvious, but I&#8217;ve had the following conversation on several occasions:</p>
<p><em><strong>Aspiring Composer:</strong></em><strong> </strong>&#8220;So… what did you think of my demo?&#8221;<br />
<em><strong>LHS:</strong></em> &#8220;Well, [other, unrelated comments]. And I would have put that first track later… maybe third. Take the fourth track and put it up front—&#8221;<br />
<strong><em>AC:</em></strong> (interrupting, slightly rudely): &#8220;—But the first track is the Main Title! The whole thing is in chronological order; I&#8217;m telling the story the way it was in the film—&#8221;<br />
<strong><em>LHS:</em></strong> (returning the favor with my own rude interruption): &#8220;—And I don&#8217;t care what the order was in the film. I think moving things around makes for a better ride.&#8221;<br />
<strong><em>AC:</em></strong> &#8220;Hmm.&#8221; (delivered in that tone of voice that means there&#8217;s no way this particular piece of advice is going to occupy any more of AC&#8217;s head space, and now AC is wondering where the nearest Starbucks might be located).</p>
<p>Do what you want with track order… but I encourage you not to set arbitrary limits. And I consider &#8220;that&#8217;s the way they appeared in the picture&#8221; to be arbitrary.</p>
<p>Finally, it&#8217;s time for <strong>Step Four: naming your cues</strong>. &#8220;1m21&#8243; isn&#8217;t gonna cut it, and unless you&#8217;ve already come up with something clever (say, in the spotting session), now&#8217;s the time to think of some really evocative titles. Again, for some reason people send me demos. The ones whose cue titles are most interesting tend to be the ones I&#8217;m most excited to hear. Simple as that.</p>
<p>If I read &#8220;Chase&#8221; or &#8220;Comedy,&#8221; I&#8217;m expecting something as generic and vanilla as its title suggests. I don&#8217;t mean to suggest that you have to put undue strain on your thesaurus for this, but it&#8217;s one of those attention-to-detail things that might make your demo ever so slightly more interesting to a listener… and that, in my opinion, makes it worth the stretch.</p>
<p>This weekend&#8217;s column isn&#8217;t intended to be my Last Word on making demos… but I hope it&#8217;s reminded you of how important it is to treat them as their own thing, rather than just copy/pasting your film-dub versions onto a CD playlist. The difference requires more effort and hassle—in some cases, a lot more—but it&#8217;s worth it.</p>
<p>If you have any other tricks or tips on this, let&#8217;s talk… hit the COMMENTS. Something I&#8217;ve left out? Something you disagree with? I&#8217;d love to hear it. SCOREcast is only as vital as we <em>all</em> make it!</p>

<p>You are going to see a lot this month about &#8220;delivery&#8221;—stems, dubs, pre dubs, etc. I want to jump in and give you some info on two delivery formats that you may or may not be too familiar with, in hopes that they will help give you a more solid method for getting your content shipped around the world.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I want to talk to you about the OMF and AAF file formats. You may need to deliver your projects in one of these formats at one time or another in addition to stems, or may receive one of these projects with video, temp music, etc. These files formats are not perfect and may need additional work when receiving one of them. However, learning to utilize each of them can make your deliveries a little more headache-free as well as more efficient on your time. That being said, if you are working on a fairly uncomplicated project, in the end, it may ultimately be simpler to just bounce your tracks individually or to stems based on your clients needs.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions<br />
<em>OMF</em></strong><em> </em> (Open Media Framework, also known as OMFI—Open Media Framework Interchange) is a platform-independent file format intended for transfer of digital media between different software applications. It was developed by Avid in 1994.</p>
<p>The OMF file format is typically used to exchange data with Digidesign Pro Tools software. The OMF format only supports the exchange of audio data (audio media and the use of this audio media in a project)—MIDI and automation data is ignored when using the export functions. (Pro Tools LE and HD need the Optional DigiTranslator software (~$500) to use OMF or AAF)</p>
<p><strong><em>AAF</em></strong><em></em> is the Advanced Authoring Format (AAF), and was developed by the Advanced Media Workflow Association in 2000 to expand on the OMF framework. AAF was created to help address the problem of multi-vendor, cross-platform interoperability for computer-based digital video production.</p>
<p>Wikipedia describes AAF in two parts:</p>
<p>1) Audio, video, still image, graphics, text, animation, music, and other forms of multimedia data. In AAF, this kind of data is called essence data.</p>
<p>2) Data that provides information on how to combine or modify individual sections of essence data or that provides supplementary information about essence data. In AAF this is called metadata. The metadata in an AAF file can provide the information needed to combine and modify the sections of essence data in the AAF file to produce a complete multimedia program.</p>
<p><strong>What You Should Know</strong><br />
OMF/AAF files are platform independent and include metadata, along with the audio and video data, and were originally developed with video editing programs from video post-production facilities. Audio could then be edited and cleaned up, mixed and sent back to the video house with the final video for final layback. You can use these formats for audio-to-audio type scenarios, but be aware that originally the formats where designed to be more a one-way workflow, rather than a back-and-forth one.</p>
<p>The metadata included in the project file is very generic in nature. It does not store any information on plug-ins, or routing of your internal busses. It does not store MIDI tracks, regions and tempo maps. However, track automation and fades are supported, but may not transfer perfectly. Therefore, you may have to consolidate all of your regions before sending the final project or print/bounce your tracks to stems.</p>
<p>Also, save your midi tracks to SMF or bounce them to audio tracks/stems. These SMF’s will include the tempo information of the session.</p>
<p>You will also have the option of (embedding) keeping your audio files within the project or keeping them in their external location. In most cases, having the audio with the project or sequence makes file management easy. File size, can be an issue with embedded files. Pro Tools, for example, cannot read an embedded OMF or AAF larger than 2 GB. Consult your DAW’s documentation for OMF/AAF instructions and limitations.</p>
<p>Try to use BWF (Broadcast Wave files) if you do not currently, for the best compatibility. You may have to convert your audio files prior to exporting the OMF/AAF.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong><br />
Careful marking and documentation is key when using OMF or AAF formats. Make sure to name all tracks, regions, etc. before exporting. Track and session notes/comments do not translate, so write down your session information like (tempo, frame rate, timecode offset, etc) in a text file or PDF and include it with the OMF/AAF project.</p>
<p>Check your DAW’s documentation for exporting/importing OMF/AAF files. Different options are offered, such as converting 24 bit to 16 bit, exporting names, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
OMF and AAF may give you many options, but as mentioned above there are many options and potential tweaks that may need to be handled. However, if your client asks for delivery of one of these formats, hopefully you will be armed with more information to be able to deliver.<br />

		<description><![CDATA[Lee usually occupies this weekly space with some incredible tips to keep you rethinking your method of madness, but this week I begged him to let me have a crack at it. Luckily for me, he obliged.

There are so many things to be thought through when you are delivering a project. The importance of solid organization at the dub sort of goes without saying. Thankfully, there are many automated procedures one can put into place to insure that very little goes wrong—OMFs, ProTools sessions, hard drive backups, laptops with mirrored contents of the entire score, massive amounts of Xanex, etc. (Just kidding on that last one!)

On the other hand, many of you are working on independent projects, and there isn't always a "dub stage"… at least, not in the traditional sense. On small to medium-sized projects, the "dub stage" is somebody's home, maybe their garage or converted den. Perhaps you are mixing at a post-house, but the "mix engineer" is also the film editor or the sound effects guy. Or maybe… it's even YOU!]]></description>

<p>There are so many things to be thought through when you are delivering a project. The importance of solid organization at the dub sort of goes without saying. Thankfully, there are many automated procedures one can put into place to insure that very little goes wrong—OMFs, ProTools sessions, hard drive backups, laptops with mirrored contents of the entire score, massive amounts of Xanex, etc. (Just kidding on that last one!)</p>
<p>On the other hand, many of you are working on independent projects, and there isn&#8217;t always a &#8220;dub stage&#8221;&#8230; at least, not in the traditional sense. On small to medium-sized projects, the &#8220;dub stage&#8221; is somebody&#8217;s home, maybe their garage or converted den. Perhaps you are mixing at a post-house, but the &#8220;mix engineer&#8221; is also the film editor or the sound effects guy. Or maybe&#8230; it&#8217;s even YOU!</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>No matter who it is, one of the most important things in delivery is keeping things straight&#8230; and more specifically, keeping your <em>files</em> organized. Proper file-naming conventions play a huge part in how successful your delivery will be, no matter if you are delivering a ProTools sessions directly to the mix engineer or if you are delivering .WAV stems to be dropped in at SMPTE sync points. If you do not keep your naming scheme clean and tidy, the worst things are possible. I&#8217;ve seen people lose huge chunks of time on the dub stage because they couldn&#8217;t find the name of a particular file that was supposed to go in a particular place in the mix. When time is of the essence—as it is EVERY time you are on a stage, be it the scoring stage or the dub stage—there is no room for these types of errors.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m about to offer is all personal preference. Of course, you can do whatever you want, but there are a few industry standards to make note of. I&#8217;ll give you a brief rundown of how I keep my file names organized at all times from the start of a project to the end, and hopefully you&#8217;ll glean at least one thing out of my trials and errors over the years to improve your own delivery process.</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong><br />
<strong>Reel &amp; Cue Numbers</strong><br />
Here is one of the standards I was referring to a second ago. Traditionally, composers indicate the reel number and cue number of every cue in the first part of the cue’s filename, and I’m no different. The very first thing that should read in the filename of any cue is the Reel number and Cue number. For example:</p>
<p><span style="color: red;"><strong>1m8</strong></span> Forget The Past 100406</p>
<p>In this example, the Reel Number is “1” and the cue number is “8”. Therefore, this file is the full mix of the 8th cue in the first reel of the film.</p>
<p><strong>Capitalization</strong><br />
I make it a point to capitalize every word in a file name—even if it is grammatically incorrect to do so. I’ve just found that uniformity at this level is key to search engines working properly, iTunes finding things correctly, and music editors not getting their proverbial undies in a bunch.</p>
<p>All words in every file should be capitalized. For example:</p>
<p>1m8 <strong><span style="color: red;">F</span></strong>orget <strong><span style="color: red;">T</span></strong>he <strong><span style="color: red;">P</span></strong>ast 100406</p>
<p><strong>Dates</strong><br />
A huge pet peeve of mine (as well as most mixers, editors, and even directors) is a file with no version indicator. I date every file that goes out of my studio using the same convention every time: yymmdd. This naming scheme insures a couple of things. First, when ﬁles are alphabetized, any ﬁles with otherwise identical names are placed in chronological order. For example:</p>
<p>6m2 All Seems Clear <span style="color: red;"><strong>100302</strong></span><br />
6m2 All Seems Clear <strong><span style="color: red;">100309</span></strong><br />
6m2 All Seems Clear <strong><span style="color: red;">100319</span></strong></p>
<p>The ﬁrst of these ﬁles was created March 2nd, 2010, and each subsequent version will follow in the list as read on any computer. Of course, you can alter this even further by appending the file&#8217;s date with a corresponding version number. For example:</p>
<p>6m2 All Seems Clear 100302<br />
6m2 All Seems Clear <strong><span style="color: red;">100302.2</span></strong><br />
6m2 All Seems Clear <strong><span style="color: red;">100302.3</span></strong><br />
6m2 All Seems Clear 100309<br />
6m2 All Seems Clear 100319</p>
<p><strong>Cue Mixes</strong><br />
On certain television shows I score, I need to deliver “cue mixes” to the dub stage. Cue Mixes are folders that contain any number of mixdown versions of the same cue. In each filename, I indicate the type of cue mix contained within the cue with a standard acronym that describes that type of mix.</p>
<p>Yours will probably be different, but in my deliveries for these shows, there are five (5) possible mixes for cues:</p>
<p>FULL MIX (tagged with BPM info)<br />
BED MIX (tagged as “Bed”)<br />
BASS AND DRUMS MIX (tagged as “BnD”)<br />
DRUMS ONLY MIX (tagged as “Drums”)<br />
KIT MIX (tagged as “Kit”)</p>
<p>For example, assume I write a cue called “It’s Complicated”. The final Cue Mixes for that cue would look like this:</p>
<p>It’s Complicated <strong><span style="color: red;">120B</span></strong> 100319<br />
It’s Complicated <strong><span style="color: red;">Bed</span></strong> 100319<br />
It’s Complicated <strong><span style="color: red;">BnD</span></strong> 100319<br />
It’s Complicated <strong><span style="color: red;">Drums</span></strong> 100319<br />
It’s Complicated <strong><span style="color: red;">Kit</span></strong> 100319</p>
<p><strong>Stems</strong><br />
If I need to break out cues into stem mixes for a film or television project (which, 99.9% IS the case), I’ll usually use the same stem heading configurations from project to project. This insures that my dub mixes are clean and tight and it also helps my mixer keep everything organized when dealing with a massive amount of musical data.</p>
<p>I typically utilize six (6) stem headings when prepping mix stems, but they may vary from project to project. My usual headings are:</p>
<p><em>BRS</em> = Brass &amp; Woodwinds (depending on the project/mix/cue, I might split these)<br />
<em>INST</em> = Instruments (piano, guitar, celeste, etc.)<br />
<em>PERC</em> = Percussion<br />
<em>STR</em> = Strings<br />
<em>SUBS</em> = Subwoofer (anything going into the .1 channel)<br />
SYN = Synths or other textural instruments (pads, ambiences, atmospheres)</p>
<p>Again, using “It’s Complicated” as the cue example, the final stem file names should look like this:</p>
<p>3m2 It’s Complicated <strong><span style="color: red;">BRS</span></strong> 100319<br />
3m2 It’s Complicated <strong><span style="color: red;">INST</span></strong> 100319<br />
3m2 It’s Complicated <strong><span style="color: red;">PERC</span></strong> 100319<br />
3m2 It’s Complicated <strong><span style="color: red;">STR</span></strong> 100319<br />
3m2 It’s Complicated <strong><span style="color: red;">SUBS</span></strong> 100319<br />
3m2 It’s Complicated <strong><span style="color: red;">SYN</span></strong> 100319</p>
<p>Notice that each of my rules are in play here: Each filename has a Reel and Cue number to indicate where it belongs; each word in the filename is capitalized; each filename has its own mix tag; each filename is dated.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
This is the system that I typically use. It&#8217;s not going to work for you every time, as parameters from project to project are different, therefore the needs of your projects are not going to be 100% congruent with the needs of my particular projects. However, this will give a jumping off point and hopefully help you get started if you currently have no real organized way to deliver your files.</p>
<p><strong><em>COMMENTS</em></strong> are open below. I&#8217;d love to hear what you have cooking in the way of file naming conventions. If you have other ideas that I&#8217;m overlooking&#8230; I wouldn&#8217;t doubt it! There are always better ways to do things, so school me. I, along with the rest of the community, am waiting!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="plus-one-wrap"><g:plusone size="medium" href="../../../2010/03/les-brockmann-mics-mixing-mastering.html"></g:plusone></div><p><a rel="attachment wp-att-459" href="../../../2010/03/les-brockmann-mics-mixing-mastering.html/sig-brockmann-2"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-459" title="sig-brockmann" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sig-brockmann.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>Since, as a mixer, I&#8217;m not involved in the mysteries of a spotting session, this month&#8217;s column is going to be another in my series of &#8220;tech tips&#8221;, covering some engineering issues that have recently been in the air.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Just one mic?</span><br />
I&#8217;ve often been asked, by a composer with a personal studio, what microphone they might buy to record &#8220;everything&#8221; they need to. To engineers, it&#8217;s a nice luxury to work in a studio or scoring stage with a well-equipped microphone closet. Part of our expertise is to know and understand the subtle differences, the sonic signatures of fine microphones, and to choose which instruments are best complemented by which mics.</p>
<p>But of course, many folks haven&#8217;t got the budget for lots of microphones. So here&#8217;s my advice: an early investment by any aspiring composer should be at least one high quality microphone. I would go with a &#8220;condenser&#8221; model (the type that needs phantom power).</p>
<p>Condenser mics are sub-categorized into large and small diameter diaphragm, and both have certain advantages. A large-diaphragm mic will probably sound best on a singer, brass, or many kinds of solo instruments. Small-diaphragm mics are often favored on acoustic guitar, percussion, or in stereo pairs if you&#8217;ve got a group of instruments to mic at a bit more distance. (But we are talking about just one here-?) If in doubt, I think I would go with a large-diaphragm  —  it may not be perfect for everything but they are pretty versatile.</p>
<p>Unlike computers and digital audio gear, a high quality microphone, like most good analog gear, can be considered an investment that will last you your whole career. Buy a name brand and it will also retain resale value, should you ever need to convert it into cash. I still like the well-known European brands such as Neumann. You can&#8217;t go wrong with any of their products. At lower price points they often are cardioid only, rather than having multiple patterns, but that&#8217;s fine. Also good are Sennheiser, AKG (although most of their models will have a sound that is less warm; I prefer them on things that are percussive or need to sparkle). Audio-Technica has some decent models at a bit lower price point. There are no low-budget Chinese import mics that I recommend. Expect to spend at least $1000 for a good versatile microphone.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve recently been working with a percussionist who has been recording everything with a modest but decent microphone. On his project, he was about to start recording a singer when we spoke, and I suggested that he rent a nice Neumann U-87; he was thrilled about how much bigger and clearer that sounded. Don&#8217;t forget, at least here in the big city, you can rent that sort of thing by the day — I think he paid $30 delivered. That certainly seems worth it, doesn&#8217;t it? (Contact me for rental referrals in the LA area.)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mixing notes</span><br />
More projects are calling for cinema-type surround music mixes. In order to do this successfully in a personal studio, a full surround monitor system is essential, five speakers plus subwoofer. There&#8217;s no way to fake this on a stereo pair of speakers.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Discrete sub track versus &#8220;bass management&#8221;:</span> The &#8220;.1&#8243; in &#8220;5.1&#8243; refers to the subwoofer channel. In final dub mixing, with dialog, music, and effects, a mixer will commonly use a discrete sixth audio channel to reinforce big low sounds such as explosions. However, in score mixing, I will (almost) never put low music information on a separate channel. The proper way to set the sub in a music studio is so that it gives your main monitors added low-end response. The music mix tracks, particularly the three in the front, will have full frequency information.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my preference to not put anything of substantial music importance in the rear or surround speakers; some reverb or, in the case of live orchestra, distant microphones, will be sufficient to give you a sense of being enveloped by the sound. Don&#8217;t forget, in most theaters and also home environments, the rear speakers are usually small, often badly placed, unaligned, or broken. I wouldn&#8217;t put anything back there that I couldn&#8217;t live without. You also don&#8217;t want any sound to pull the attention of the audience away from the screen  —  what cinema sound guru Tomlinson Holman calls &#8220;the exit sign effect&#8221;, as in, you don&#8217;t want people to turn and look at the exit sign. The story is in front.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Does &#8220;mastering&#8221; apply to score mixing?</span><br />
I&#8217;ve recently been reading an excellent book, which I would highly recommend to all professional engineers, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Audio-Second-science-Book/dp/0240808371/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1269630630&amp;sr=1-1">“Mastering Audio: The art and the science” by Bob Katz</a>. It&#8217;s a real college level course on many fine details of audio mixing and processing, outboard gear usage, digital audio details, etc. The emphasis is on the sort of thing that would apply to album (CD) production, but with some good information about surround, DVD, and sound for picture as well.</p>
<p>One of the topics that he speaks very eloquently about is the &#8220;loudness wars&#8221; in which excessive compression and peak limiting is used to make music sound &#8220;louder&#8221;. He explains how and why this almost always makes music sound worse, not only because real good music has a dynamic range, but also because this never results in louder broadcast sound, only increased distortion.</p>
<p>Why should we care in the score business? In music for picture, there isn&#8217;t a mastering stage of production; your mastering engineer is your dubstage music mixer. Many composers are of the opinion that it helps somehow to put compression or peak limiting on their mix; some even have plug-ins to do this as part of their DAW template. I disagree. There&#8217;s no substitute or shortcut for mixing to an even and carefully considered balance, and of course checking with the dialog track turned on. <a href="../../../2009/11/technical-guidelines-for-film-and-tv.html">More info</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mac work</span><br />
I don&#8217;t solicit jobs installing software or building new computers, but occasionally a client asks me to do so. Things can get pretty complicated in putting together all the software that musicians depend on these days; it all has to work together smoothly, or you will have untold grief, as I&#8217;m sure we have all experienced.</p>
<p>I was recently reminded, again, of a truth that I will pass on as a public service. If you buy a new Macintosh, and choose to do the setup and software installation yourself, please bear this in mind: do not ever EVER use &#8220;Migration Assistant&#8221; to bring in settings or documents from your previous machine. This vomits lots of obsolete, incompatible, and potentially destructive preferences, drivers, and other code into the new machine. You&#8217;ll never get them out without reformatting the drive and starting over. Even if you think it will save time and money, just say no, do it the hard way. You will be glad you read and remembered this.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">More?</span><br />
I&#8217;m always happy to help people navigate the complexities and subtleties of engineering; it&#8217;s what I do for a living. What&#8217;s on your mind regarding recording and mixing music for the screen?

In line with this month&#8217;s SCOREcast focus, I want to address the issue of spotting for video games, and how it differs from spotting films.</p>
<p>Among other things, the issue of <em>interactivity</em> throws up opportunities and challenges that are unique to video games. We&#8217;ll take a look at exactly what the opportunities and challenges are, and how they can help you successfully spot a game. We&#8217;ll also take a look at who turns up to a game spotting session, and how the musical decision making (at least in my experience) can be decentralized compared with a film.</p>
<p>Hit the jump, and let&#8217;s get into it &#8230;<br />
<a name="more"></a>While certain situations in video game scoring (like cinematics) seem call for a more-or-less identical approach to film scoring, most really don&#8217;t! So let&#8217;s take a look at what these are, and how to spot them effectively. But first… who is actually at the session?</p>
<p><strong>The Team</strong><br />
In my experience, a video game spotting session will involve: the Game Designer (like a film director, except he also usually writes the story and dialogue, at least in part), the Audio Director (like a music supervisor, but he&#8217;s oversees the foley, sound design, etc.), the Sound Designer (the guy who actually makes all the non-musical sounds in the game), and the Composer (you!). Also present may be a producer or similar &#8220;suit&#8221;, who may be there to make sure the music will in line with the desired slant of the game on a commercial level (not too dark, not too family-oriented, that kind of thing).</p>
<p><strong>The Big Picture</strong><br />
Before you jump in and start discussing where the music should go, and other specifics, the most important aspect of spotting a game is to get the overall tone right. Is it orchestral? Hybrid? Electronic? Punk?</p>
<p>Hopefully the audio director has chosen the right composer for the job &#8212; but that needn&#8217;t be so! I was once approached to score a game based solely on the hype that surrounded my first game soundtrack. It was an &#8220;X-treme&#8221; racing game that required a fast-paced neo-punk soundtrack. Me being mainly an orchestral composer, it was sort of like asking Madonna to do a death metal album. Of course, it never got as far as a spotting session, but in any case: the first thing to do at the spotting session is make sure everyone is on the same page genre-wise.</p>
<p>Beyond that, what is it all about? What&#8217;s the big picture? The game could be a shoot-em-up, but is it about <em>honor</em>? <em>Survival</em>, perhaps? <em>Bloodlust</em>? <em>Black comedy</em> even? What is the overall <em>tone</em> of this game?</p>
<p>I remember when I spotted the adventure game <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/dreamfall-original-soundtrack/id161856912">Dreamfall</a>, we established that it was sort of an &#8220;Empire Strikes Back&#8221; situation, where it was a huge adventure on the surface, but by the end almost everything has gone wrong for our heroes, including the death of a much-loved character from the prequel, April Ryan. So there was an underlying tragic tone that had to permeate the score as a whole.</p>
<p>Another important thing to find out at the start is: who is in charge here? In my experience, the Audio Director had far more sway over the music than the Game Designer. In fact, I reported directly to him for the entire duration, having only sparse contact with the Game Designer. Granted, it all had to go through the Designer, but on several occasions the Audio Director disagreed with the Designer, and the music went through anyway. I often took direction from the Sound Designer too, because he was in charge of implementing the music into the game&#8217;s engine.</p>
<p>Now for some specific details regarding how to spot a game. The paradigm of interactivity requires a different spotting mindset to film making. Whereas music in a film is, in the end, invariably attached to a scene, music in a game can be attached to all sorts of things: locations, cinematic sequences, characters, player status, storyline&#8230; Let&#8217;s take a look at some of these:</p>
<p><strong>Locations (And Loops)</strong><br />
Much of the time, you need music to set the tone for a location in a game. It is common for music to be written so that it loops back around, but it needn&#8217;t be so. Sometimes the music will rest for a while and then come back so as not to become tiresome. This is something to spot at the session, based on whether the player will be spending a lot of time at that location or not. If the music needs to loop, this is a technical issue which you will need to bear in mind at the composing and production stage.</p>
<p>In any case, locations may well have music &#8220;attached&#8221; to them in your game, so make sure you discuss all the locations in the game fully, and find out what tone is needed according to the Designer.</p>
<p><strong>Cinematic Sequences</strong><br />
Cinematic sequences (or &#8220;cinematics&#8221;) are when a game turns into a film for a short while. You just sit and watch, without being able to control a character. When you spot the game, it is very likely that many cinematic sequences are either unfinished or not started yet, but the Designer will know where they go. Find out!</p>
<p>Technical issues I have encountered include things like: will the cinematic lead into a loop afterward, or will it come before a loop? I remember taking care that the lead-in and lead-out of my cinematic music sounded good cross-fading into the loops that might precede or succeed them. (The technique was usually to start on a single, longish note that was in key, or compatible with all the keys the loops were in.) These are things you will need to find out at the spotting session.</p>
<p><strong>Characters</strong><br />
Some games have more than one playable character, and you may find the story calls for different music to be &#8220;attached&#8221; to a character. When I scored Dreamfall, there was a scene set in some swamplands where the same timeline was told from the perspective of three different characters in turn. This story-telling device is often used in movie making &#8212; I remember some of Tarantino&#8217;s &#8220;Pulp Fiction&#8221; was done that way.</p>
<p>In this case, it was decided that the music be &#8220;attached&#8221; not to the location, but the character you were playing. So the gamer would have different music each time they played through the same timeline. I had written themes for each characters, and the underscore was weaved with those themes.</p>
<p><strong>Player Status</strong><br />
When spotting a game, it&#8217;s good to look for opportunities where the music may change according to the player&#8217;s gaming status. For instance: in an action game the music may become frenzied when the player is low on health. Similarly, you may explore the possibility that the music will change depending on whether the player is &#8220;in combat&#8221; or not.</p>
<p><strong>Storyline</strong><br />
Lastly, and most importantly, the storyline itself will often dictate the music used at any given point in the game, irrespective location, character, etc. It&#8217;s easy to lose sight of this kind of thing when scoring a long game, which is why it&#8217;s important to try to nail these issues at the spotting session.</p>
<p>For example, Zoë (the main character in Dreamfall) is playable in the location of Casablanca at various points during the game. The music at the beginning of the game is light and playful, in accordance with the still-budding story. At the final chapter of the game however, the music is slow, brooding, dark and slightly tragic you walk her through Casablanca.</p>
<p>So in this case the music is not attached to location nor character, but the storyline itself.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>In closing, spotting a game successfully really requires you to be a gamer. The mechanics of interactive storytelling really are very different from film making. So, if you&#8217;re truly serious about game scoring, that means you have to play games for at least 10 hours a day! Otherwise you just can&#8217;t call yourself a professional.</p>
<p>Jokes aside, it&#8217;s tough to make spotting decisions successfully without having at least some experience playing a really great, triple-A game. So why not pick one up and see what they did with the music? What would you have done differently? What did they do that you might not have thought of yourself? Call it work :)</p>

The content, in other words: What is this cue trying to achieve, and how should we approach that in a spotting session? How much to say; how to say it?<br />
<a name="more"></a><br />
The truth is that this part is simple, as long as you&#8217;re following a few guidelines. It&#8217;s not easy—you&#8217;re expected to be handing a number of different dynamics during a spotting session, after all—but it is simple.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d start with this: <strong>Focus the conversation on dramatic needs.</strong> You want to avoid loading up on musical terminology pretty much throughout your collaboration, but more so than ever during spotting. Because you haven&#8217;t written anything yet, now&#8217;s the time when it&#8217;s most tempting to try to explain what your ideas are by using musical language.</p>
<p>Resist. Not only does it threaten to alienate your collaborators, it also hems you in unnecessarily. Keep the conversation focused, as much as possible, on what the music should be trying to achieve.</p>
<p>Next up: <strong>Consider alternate approaches</strong>. Here I&#8217;m speaking in terms of the highest-level conceptual approach to a scene. You can score a scene <em>entirely viscerally</em> (&#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mousing">Mickey-mousing</a>&#8216; being the obvious example); at such a remove that you&#8217;re actually <em>playing against scene;</em> or somewhere in between (music that reflects the character&#8217;s state of mind, for example, or that speaks to the larger dramatic situation that is unfolding rather than simply reacting to actions).</p>
<p>Keeping this entire spectrum of possible approaches in your mind allows cool and original ideas to present themselves to you. Especially when there&#8217;s an easy, obvious way to come at a scene, you might want to step back mentally for a moment and consider: what if I did the Other Thing here? It takes a certain presence of mind to do, and that comes with practice—but a certain, deliberate, willful sort of practice.</p>
<p>For me, it&#8217;s a similar mental muscle to the one I exercise when I&#8217;m watching a picture on TV while continuously focusing on only the music. It&#8217;s not difficult, exactly, but easy to lose focus and let important moments slide by unremarked.</p>
<p>Also, you&#8217;ll need to <strong>address filmmaker requests</strong>. This one is probably the most important thing you&#8217;ll do, for a number of reasons. If the director wants a certain approach that you&#8217;re absolutely convinced is wrong… the spotting session is likely the place where that&#8217;s gonna come to light. If you&#8217;re going to be pressed harder and harder just to copy the temp, you&#8217;ll find that out (or your initial impression will be confirmed) at the spotting session. And so on.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to make it sound like too much gloom and doom here, though: there are also <em>great</em> ideas that filmmakers bring to the spotting session. Things you might not even have considered. After all, these people have been present throughout the project&#8217;s gestation, and they may even have built a scene or two with a specific musical effect in mind.</p>
<p>Bottom line on this one: you&#8217;re going to have to take up the issue of specific filmmaker ideas, requests and even <em>demands</em> pretty much every time out. Yes, they cut into your domain. Yes, they can torpedo your carefully-considered approach. Yes, sometimes it sounds like the filmmakers weren&#8217;t even listening to your prepared speech at the outset, selling your concept for the score.</p>
<p>If the approach is workable, if the ideas they&#8217;re bringing are something you can live with at all, I suggest you hang in there, make your argument without being a pest about it, and get about the business of trying to orient yourself to whatever it is they&#8217;re suggesting. If only to understand why another creative human being would prefer that choice. Think of it as a way to expand your own <a href="../../../2009/09/weekend-provocation-locus-of-cool.html">locus of cool</a>, if nothing else.</p>
<p>See? All pretty simple stuff. Not easy, but simple. I want to hear what you think on this one… I know there&#8217;s more to be discussed here, so consider this Weekend Provocation article a stub (Wikipedia-style) that we can all add to in the discussion, below. I&#8217;ll try to sneak by once or twice over the weekend and offer a bit more if there are questions.</p>
<p>Happy spotting! I&#8217;m looking forward to next month and a whole new theme… and to hearing from you all.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="plus-one-wrap"><g:plusone size="medium" href="../../../2010/03/heather-fenoughty-staying-in-sync.html"></g:plusone></div><p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sig-fenoughty.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-553" title="sig-fenoughty" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sig-fenoughty.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>This has been a fascinating month of articles on the ins, outs, technicalities, principles and importance of music spotting. It&#8217;s fair to say that the spotting session is an essential part of the music composition process, without which it is virtually impossible to stay in line &#8211; in sync &#8211; with the director&#8217;s vision for the film.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been lots of useful, insider&#8217;s info about how spotting sessions apply in the world of big-budget, LA Studio films &#8211; but the principles are equally applicable to micro-budget, small-scale, shorts, documentaries, commercials, multimedia and web applications, games… even wedding videos! Hey, you gotta get experience somewhere. ;-)</p>
<p>On, say, shorts and low-budget documentaries, or on projects where the schedule is ongoing, you may be tempted not to do a spotting session. You want to just dive in and play it by ear.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The director may ask you for your overall opinion on the style and tone of the film then just want to leave you to it.</p>
<p>The creative team may have even been with the film so long that they&#8217;re completely fed up with it, and just want it finished!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been brought on to the production very late in the day, the director (and others like the producer, editor, executives) may have made all the creative decisions already and could be extremely specific about the musical quality of each scene, even presenting you with a cue plot of sorts.</p>
<p><em>You can see this as a good thing &#8211; they care about the film and the effect of the music on the story. Remember, however, your role as musical expert, your opinion is valid and your objective pair of eyes may be the breath of fresh air the project needs to take it to the next level.</em></p>
<p>Worst case scenario: they may send you the film with the temp score and tell you to follow it precisely for position, style and tone, relegating you, in effect, to the level of technician rather than the creative equal that you signed on to be.</p>
<p>But it is just as important to treat these lower-budget or short films with the same respect as their bigger-budget counterparts &#8211; not only for the experience you gain that will put you in good stead for more expensive projects &#8211; but to make the best possible music for this film.</p>
<p>Hopefully preliminary meetings will have meant that you and the director have developed a common vocabulary, an understanding of each others creative styles and an appreciation for the unique qualities that each will be bringing to the table.</p>
<p>In preparation you will have seen the film and already developed your ideas and questions about the overall piece and individual scenes, even moments.</p>
<p>The spotting session may indeed be the first time you&#8217;ve actually met in person, and if you&#8217;re in with a newbie or inexperienced director it&#8217;s important to spell out the plan of attack for this meeting, what you need from the director to proceed, to enable them to ask questions and really have a creative dialogue as equals. Outline the agenda to make sure that the meeting is both efficient, thorough and effective.</p>
<div>Steer the conversation towards tone, pace and emotional journey and away from musical specifics such as key, musical themes and instrumentation.</p>
<p>If you really can&#8217;t get the director in the room with you for whatever reason (or on Skype, so you can see his facial expressions and body language), do the spotting session yourself as a backup/contingency/plan of last resort and get approval for every cue from the director by sending your beautifully organised cue plot and asking for notes if necessary on each one.</p>
<p>Flag up any different options for each scene if they exist &#8211; and they will &#8211; and then schedule a phone call so that you can discuss and thrash out the specifics.</p>
<p>Once the meeting has been had and all parties have come to an agreement on how the music will enhance, elaborate, advance or even juxtapose every onscreen element, get those notes typed up as soon as possible and emailed to every interested party (could just be the director, but it is also worth adding in the editor(s) and the producer)</p>
<p>Keeping everyone in sync and in the loop allows all parties to relax in the knowledge that you&#8217;re organized, efficient and including all of their creative input in your musical creations. Nobody has to mind-read or worry that you&#8217;re going off in a bizarre direction. It&#8217;s all down on paper.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s also so important for your peace of mind. The cue plot is a clear framework &#8211; your road map &#8211; to creating the best score you can. You don&#8217;t need to worry that you&#8217;re wandering down musical blind alleys or dead-ends.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a clear agreement between you and the director &#8211; if minds are changed later down the line as to the direction or purpose of a cue, you&#8217;re now in a solid position to think about renegotiating your schedule, fee, or whatever form of compensation you&#8217;re receiving.</p>
<p>Without it, you&#8217;re stuck with the original timeframe for delivery, you&#8217;re at the mercy of the director changing his mind on a whim, and you&#8217;re stealing time from composing other cues to correct these &#8216;mistakes&#8217;.</p>
<p>This will inevitably lead to a sub-par score, the creative disappointment and stress you&#8217;ll experience, the poor word-of-mouth that will inevitably transpire. A complete waste of time.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t put yourself through this. Do a spotting session. And do it right. :-)</p>

What are the right choices to move your career forward? Here are a couple of contrasting ideas, both worth considering in their own context.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">More bits</span><br />
To start with, here I am wearing my &#8220;technical guru&#8221; hat. Let&#8217;s review some things about digital and computer audio; there&#8217;s a new technical trend and product you should be aware of.</p>
<p>You probably know that digital audio, in the files we create and the way in the signals can flow from one piece of equipment to another, can be in a variety of different sample rates (44.1KHz, 48KHz, etc.) and word lengths (usually 24-bit for most professional applications). (If you need a refresher, check my article &#8220;<a href="../../../2009/09/technical-guidelines-for-film-and-tv.html">Technical Guidelines for Film and TV Scoring — Part 1</a>&#8220;.) Recently there has been a lot of talk about &#8220;32-bit&#8221; and &#8220;64-bit&#8221; — how does that fit into all of this?</p>
<p>The new Apple Mac Pro computers with Intel Core2 Duo processors and the newest operating system, 10.6 (Snow Leopard) are said to be 64-bit capable. Do they sound even better? No, not necessarily. 32-bit and 64-bit don&#8217;t have anything to do with digital audio formatting or fidelity. What this is all about is the ability of any individual software app to access on-board RAM memory.</p>
<p>With 32-bit capability, which is how things have been up until now, an app such as our familiar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstations_%28DAW%29">DAW</a> hosts Digital Performer, Logic, etc., can have a current working file size of up to 4 gigabytes. This includes the amount of memory that is needed for plug-in soft synths, many of which are getting to be pretty substantial memory hogs. This would include, but not limited to, such popular products as Omnisphere, Trillian, Ivory, and the various orchestral library sample players. Maybe you&#8217;ve noticed, by the time you get a few of those instantiated, your DAW becomes logy, slower and less responsive, maybe crashy. It&#8217;s not just processor power, it&#8217;s memory handling.</p>
<p>When clients ask me about buying a computer, a common question is how much RAM memory to equip it with? The computers can hold more and more, but if the DAW can only be filled up to 4 GB then the practical guidelines have been maybe 8 GB total. But that&#8217;s not the case anymore; on a new machine I would recommend 16 GB or more — I think very shortly you are going to be able to put that to good use.</p>
<p>In order to run more soft synths, there have been work-arounds that some composers have used. A common and practical one is <a href="http://www.plogue.com/?cat=4">Plogue Bidule</a>. This app runs in the background along with your DAW, talks to it (sound and MIDI) via <a href="http://www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/index.cfm?fuseaction=get_article&amp;article=rewire">ReWire</a>, and can act as host for plug-in soft synths in a variety of formats. The instruments connect to and can be programmed in your DAW software but are not limited by how much memory an individual app can access, at least up to the 4 GB limit. So effectively you can double your capacity, with some soft synths in your DAW and some in Plogue.</p>
<p>But now we are entering the era of 64-bit memory accessing, so this limitation is going to go away. With 64-bit, a processor can address up to 16 exabytes of memory (that&#8217;s over 16 billion gigabytes)! Now the DAWs, sample players, and other apps have to be re-written in order to take advantage of this. Some already have: Logic 9.1 is 64-bit ready, and (some) SpectraSonics synths. Others can be expected to join the party certainly within the next year or so.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there is another &#8220;background&#8221;-type host which looks to be an even better bet than Plogue: <a href="http://vsl.co.at/en/65/71/1738/1356.vsl">Vienna Ensemble Pro</a>. This was built for their excellent Vienna Orchestra sample sets, but can work with other brand plug-ins as well, and the advantage is that it comes with both 32-bit and 64-bit versions — you can run both at the same time, hosting whichever format your individual sample instruments might support. Composer <a href="http://www.joelgoodman.com/">Joel Goodman</a>, recently installed these and reports that his performance with Digital Performer 7.1 has been generally smooth and trouble free (well … we are talking software here!). (Special thanks to Joel who brought me up to speed on this stuff.)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">More people</span><br />
Now let&#8217;s talk about something that will make your music even more exciting than the best software instruments, I promise.</p>
<p>How many of you would be willing to take your entire fee from a gig, maybe even several gigs, and invest it in the newest greatest computer software or hardware upgrade? &#8220;Yeah, I can see that, it keeps getting better and you gotta keep up, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, how many of you would be willing to take that same pile of money and invest it in a room full of expert studio musicians, for one day? Or maybe just a few of them?</p>
<p>Not so easy, is it? &#8220;My clients don&#8217;t really care. There&#8217;s no budget for it, or time. I&#8217;m barely making ends meet as it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve observed something from my engineer&#8217;s chair: Everybody&#8217;s got about the same computer tools, and you need them of course. But the typical one-man band-in-a-box score is a pretty good way to get more of the same kind of work you already have, but not necessarily to move a career forward.</p>
<p>A couple of examples come to mind: most people are familiar with the composer Michael Giacchino. A couple of years ago at the SCL annual meeting, he told the story of his big break, when he insisted on using a live orchestra to score a video game. Now of course that&#8217;s not uncommon — thank you Michael! I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll ever reach for Omnisphere when he wants to pull someone&#8217;s heartstrings.</p>
<p>Or, closer to my home: composer <a href="http://www.miriamcutler.com/">Miriam Cutler</a>, whose documentary scores always feature as many live warm human beings playing instruments as she can possibly squeeze in. Often they are recorded one at a time, in her personal studio, and sometimes layered with electronic textures as well, but the net effect is an organic and emotional sound that keeps her in demand in her chosen genre. I know she&#8217;ll agree that insisting on live musicians is a big part of what gives her music the magic that clients notice.</p>
<p>Think about it: when you add even one more expert player to your mix, you are doubling the intellectual and creative firepower. And in a city like Los Angeles, there is an incredible wealth of experienced players who have &#8220;been there and done that&#8221; over and over. They bring not only the ability to play a part in tune and expressively, but help solve dramatic problems, improvise in just the right way for the emotion of a scene, or give an immediate sonic spark that you&#8217;d never get out of East-West Quantum Leap even if you worked all night.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not in Southern California (or just want to stay off the freeway), ask me and I can refer you to amazing musicians with personal studios and high-speed Internet who can work with you anywhere in the world — guitarists in every style from metal to ethnic world sounds, woodwinds and brass players, harp, bass, a pianist with an amazing Bösendorfer piano, some percussionists, fiddle and other strings, kick-ass drummers, even a pretty good mixing engineer  :-) . All with experience in major motion picture and television scores.</p>
<p>I have to admit, I&#8217;m not a composer and I don&#8217;t write the checks. Maybe yet another episode of a reality series is not the time to suddenly splurge on a bunch of live guys (although check out &#8220;Lost&#8221;); if so then what about the next big pitch demo? You will have to find the right time and place, but I strongly believe it&#8217;s worthwhile.</p>
<p>What do you think? I&#8217;d be very interested to have composers weigh in with comments about when and if you have worked with expert live players (no matter where you are located), and what your experience was.</p>
<p>Who is your secret weapon (don&#8217;t worry we won&#8217;t tell), player or players that you couldn&#8217;t do a score without? Did you ever try live musicians and then regret it? Did you ever work with a musician who gave you fantastic results that you never would have expected? Did you learn something? Did your clients (or demo targets) care, or notice? Did you get the gig? Would you do it again?</p>

It could, but it could also bear no relevance whatsoever. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">For me being a recording engineer and having to appeal to a wide variety of people means that I need to stay competitive in my gear selection, my rates, my marketing, and my best practices. I can no longer afford just try to compete on my talent or skill alone. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><a name="more"></a></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">The market branding of technology has both helped and hurt us in this regard. If I say, &#8220;ProTools&#8221;, you know exactly what I’m talking about and you probably know that it is the defacto standard in most recording studios, post houses, and professional dubbing stages. While there is always a 2nd competitor lurking in the wings, for the most part ProTools is the king. This is not a debate of whether Digital Performer (my DAW) is better or can do the same thing as ProTools, but it’s simply the expectation that this is what you are required to have.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">I had someone recently stop by my studio to chat about music and a future recording project. He looked at all of my vintage gear and mic pre-amps. Then, without even hesitating, he said, “So you have Pro Tools right?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Now, I don’t have a full blown HD system. I have an LE system that I bought for the purpose of being able to open and import other clients PT sessions, but I do not use it as my main DAW. Trying to remain competitive, for a brief moment, I had to put on my selling hat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">&#8220;While I do have Pro Tools, I use DP to record everything you need recorded!&#8221; </span></p>
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">After spending all my money on my gear, I didn’t like the feeling of having to justify myself, but the potentially of having the client leave and go somewhere else solely based on me not having Pro Tools would have been catastrophic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">But by illustration, this is how a competitor could take business from me. A potential client could go elsewhere simply because I don’t have the right microphone or the right compressor. I have had this happen. Again, not because what I had was junk, but someone told someone, who told someone, who read it on the latest audio blog that you have to use a Neve pre amp and an SSL to mix on.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">I still have not fully embraced the ProTools regime. Call me a rebel, but this could affect me, or even my chance to go work at another studio. Even if I have over 20 years of recording experience could I get overlooked if I don’t know ProTools? Maybe…</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">So&#8230; do you need more gear, the latest sound library, monitors, or microphone to remain competitive? The answer is that it depends on what your goal is. Think about what you do and what you have to offer from a talent, skill, or business perspective. Weigh the pros and cons of any financial or potential gear purchase. Could this new technology help you? If 9 out of 10 clients keep asking for a specific drum program, it may be worth investing in. If you need something versus wanting something that may in fact make you more competitive, then by all means, carry on my wayward son!</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">For me, it’s a struggle of trying to keep a certain standard in my own mind as far as a service that I provide, versus the kid in his basement charging $15 dollars/hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">What about you? Hit me back in the <strong>COMMENTS</strong> below and let&#8217;s talk this through. Is the assumption that certain technologies are a must important to the issue of strong competition? Is it even worth competing if your set-up does not contain a certain &#8220;level&#8221; of string library or a particular piece of EQ software? </span></p>
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">And now&#8230; off to buy the new Neve and an SSL!</span></p>

At take 282 <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=2338142&amp;l=af8f6852cc&amp;id=631393172">Rick Marvin</a>, our composer, wondered how many takes we would accumulate by the time we finished our fifth session on the day this article posts. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=2339640&amp;l=d2903f2a9f&amp;id=631393172">Vinny “Smart Water” Cirilli</a>, our Protools Recordist, and software virtuoso of <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/vcirilli/CueChronicle/">CueChronicle</a> said, “I wonder how many takes &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" title="The Simpsons" rel="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096697/">The Simpsons</a>&#8221; are up to?” We found out that “The Simpsons”, which had scored mostly at Fox, was at the take thirty thousand mark.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, up until a couple of months ago I had no idea most T.V. shows were scored in the box &#8211; that’s how long it’s been since I worked in TV. In my day everything was scored with an orchestra of about thirty players. I started in T.V. and we scored five shows a week, every week. I’m aware of what a composer can achieve from today’s synth studio, but I still feel badly for the thousands of sessions lost to the incredible <a href="http://www.afm.org/locals/info/number/47">Local 47</a> musicians. In this regard I don’t think technology is our friend. I asked a session player friend to comment on this and they were reluctant to do so. I understand the reasons.</p>
<p>Are today’s T.V. scores better then they were in my day? I don’t know the answer to that. I can tell you that the composers I worked with wrote to timing notes which detailed everything that happened in the particular picture sequences they were writing. This forced the composer to hit their ‘anchor points’ of dialogue and cuts. Funny how you don’t see much of that these days even though the composer has digital picture. The go-to book in my day was called “Scoring For Films” by the composer <a href="http://www.earlehagen.net/">Earle Hagen</a>.  If you’re studying composition it might be worth a look see. Another interesting film music book from &#8216;the old days&#8221; is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=7ozTus2HZbsC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Film+music++By+Roy+M.+Prendergast#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">Film Music by Roy Prendergast.</a> I included this link because it detailed the kind of work we did as music editors. That illustration is a bar breakdown chart, where you can see the timings of the action and the cuts above the written music.</p>
<p>Another concept worth noting are today’s main titles vs the classic main titles. Check it out. I would love to hear your feedback on what makes a great Main Title. I still love the themes I can remember. It always made the show a bit more fun and exciting to watch, but that&#8217;s my take. It just takes mentioning &#8220;The Love Boat&#8221;, &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" title="Gilligan's Island" rel="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057751/">Gilligan&#8217;s Island</a>&#8220;, or &#8220;Hill St. Blues&#8221; and you have that tune in your head. Am I right? For me, that&#8217;s the stuff great main titles contain. What are your favorites?</p>

<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">LEARN YOUR SAMPLE LIBRARIES</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The simplest way to do this is just working on a project.  If you don’t have a big one on the table, make some exercises or write some library music- get to know the strengths and weaknesses of your samples, and their unique characteristics.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Is there reverb on the sample?  If it is nice reverb, perhaps you can leave it in or match your other samples using similar reverb settings.  If not, can you alter the release or decay section of the Amplitude Envelope to minimize the reverb?  (See basic analog synthesis for an explanation of this one)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">How is it recorded?  Close mic’ed in an anechoic chamber?  Or from a distance in a large hall?  You can match the sound of different spaces through gently cutting certain frequencies (often by using a low cut or a narrow dip at 1.5kHz).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Is there phasing on the sample? (Yes… a certain library that rhymes with ‘Sienna’ is notorious for poor recordings)  Perhaps you can alter the phase and use some EQ to fix this.  If not, just move on to the next.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Which samples have long attack?  Short attack?  Can these be altered?  Which samples are good for staccato?  Spiccato?  Detache?  Etc.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The goal here is efficiency- not only how good your mockup will sound but how fast you’ll get it there.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE GREAT DEBATE &#8211; EXPRESSION vs. VOLUME</span></span></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Essentially, these 2 parameters do the same thing.  However, volume is notorious for causing craziness in your DAW.  Ever write volume automation to a midi region and then try riding the track’s volume automation?  Then you know what I mean- things get messy really quickly!</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">For simplicity’s sake, many will use expression to shape phrasing and the volume of an instrument from note to note.  Volume will be used to make greater adjustments from section to section, or may not be used at all.  Often, you can use a short volume ride to help and instrument go to “11” when you need it.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">ON THAT NOTE…</span></span></span></span></span><br />
Write in default expression and volume parameters into each track of your template at bar 0 (or earlier). Give yourself plenty of headroom so you don’t overload the master bus.  Try keeping the volume at 0db (usually 100 in midi terms) and start with an expression value of 64.  This way, each track you work on will have a similar dynamic level and range, avoiding time consuming re-mixing later in your workflow.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">BEYOND VOLUME AND EXPRESSION</span><br />
Here is where you can really do some damage, in a good way!  A few things you can do to really get expressive with your sounds-</p>
<p>- Rather than using velocity to switch between samples (i.e. soft, medium, and loud), use a continuous controller like the modulation wheel (cc1) to crossfade between them.  This is fairly easy to set up in Vienna Instruments, a little bit more difficult in EXS and Kontakt- but still fairly straightforward and well worth your time.  So rather than guessing how hard your finger is hitting the keyboard and fixing your velocities later in the piano roll editor, you can instead have a smooth transition between samples while pounding on the piano however your fists like.</p>
<p>You can also use this same parameter to do other cool stuff.  For instance, not only does my mod wheel control the velocity crossfade of my Vienna sample, but the legato sample changes to a portamento sample when the mod wheel is fully up (value of 127).  You can have a lot of fun (not to mention create some cool sounds!) by controlling several parameters from one fader.</p>
<p>- Use another fader in your setup to control the filter a.k.a. “brightness.”  The default midi controller value for this is 74.  So I set a fader on my keyboard to midi controller number 74 and set up my samples to *gently* open and close a low pass filter with this parameter.</p>
<p>Allow me to explain- first get the sound of a trumpet in your head.  Now, imagine it playing loud- it is piercing, bright.  Imagine it playing softly- it is now mellow and a bit darker.  Sometimes our sample libraries have a hard time sampling this many layers.  I’m very often disappointed with the soft samples, and use a filter to add some extra expressiveness to my mockups.</p>
<p>-Use yet another fader in your setup to control sample start (very easy to do in EXS!).  This could be any controller number, so just pick one.  This will add variety to libraries that might otherwise be very bland.  For instance- by starting a sample later than the default beginning, you can avoid the “machine gun” effect.  If your trumpet sample starts with the same sharp attack each time, you can use this to vary it up.</p>
<p>This will also create much more depth in string samples because instead of every note starting at the same exact place (same attack, same color, etc.) you now have can have a slightly different sound for the beginning of each note.  Don’t go crazy with this one, but use it when necessary.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of sample your are working with, you may have to attach this parameter to the Attack portion of the Amplitude Envelope- just ever so slightly though!</p>
<p>-Try alternative controllers to faders.  For instance, the drum pads on my M-Audio Axiom keyboard actually have aftertouch (!) and can be assigned to any continuous midi controller.  So not only can I move faders to get what I want, but I can gently move my finger up and down on these pads to get a different quality of expression.  Ribbon and breath controllers can be fun too!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">BEER AND PIZZA</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Tried to catch you off guard with that one!  This pertains to bringing over your close musician friends in exchange for food when you are low on funds.  “Sweetening” refers to mixing in a soloist or small group of musicians to an otherwise all-synth track.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">You should be careful not to get tempted into mixing a live player in too hot- when done right, they can blend right into your real instruments and add that certain ‘je ne sais qua’ that you are looking for.  Maybe it’s the breathing, the space between the notes, or the gentle imperfections, but just one live player can bring your whole track to life!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">However, precautions must be taken.  Nothing sounds worse than a live player on top of terrible samples, a shabby mix or reverb, or a poorly programmer mockup.  They will stick out like a sore thumb.  I can’t emphasize this enough- spend plenty of time listening to REAL, LIVING PERFORMERS- in concerts, on CD, online, however you can- and imitating their mannerisms through your work as a synth programmer.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">QUANTIZE LESS, PRACTICE MORE</span></span></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I think my students at UCLA might mutter this in their sleep.  This is my mantra!  There is no greater mockup killer than extreme or inappropriate quantization.  On the other hand, there is no greater mockup enhancer than a well played, expressive solo that is right in the pocket!  Find the ‘groove’ and practice before you hit record.  If you can’t get a good expressive performance out of yourself, you won’t have any idea how to get it out of your live musicians.  Even if it is one short phrase at a time, recorded at half time- get the MUSIC down right and then hit record!  And don’t kill it with too much quantization.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Alright junior Zimmers… have fun out there!</span></span></span></span></p>

<div style="font-family: inherit;">
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sig-ogden1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-672" title="sig-ogden" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sig-ogden1.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>On the heels of a killer column post from SCOREcast co-host Lee Sanders on Wednesday about &#8220;<a href="../../../2009/07/surviving-crunch.html">Surviving the Crunch</a>&#8220;, James Olszewski asked a very pertinent question:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote style="font-family: inherit;">
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: small;">What do you recommend to develop a passable roadmap on a compressed timeline?&#8230; I&#8217;d like to get a peek at what one of these roadmaps looks like (even if it&#8217;s just scribbles and random notes). Being the &#8220;planner&#8221; I am, I&#8217;m already thinking of some sort of template. Maybe something that takes you progressively from random notes to roadmap to spotting to cue sheet&#8230;. Does anything like that already exist?</span></p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">This is a great question, and one that could be met with as many different answers as there are composers that exercise this practice. In this post, I&#8217;m going to show you a handful of the things that I do in my work that help me achieve a cohesive plan when taking on a new set of visuals to score. Before I do that, though, let&#8217;s define a set of assumed parameters so that we can make sure we are all on the same page.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">I&#8217;m assuming that:</span></div>
<ol style="font-family: inherit;">
<li><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>You are *not* working with a <a class="zem_slink" title="Music editor (filmmaking)" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_editor_%28filmmaking%29">music editor</a>.</strong> A music editor, according to <a class="zem_slink" title="Fred Karlin" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Karlin">Fred Karlin</a>,  is the &#8220;person responsible for all physical details regarding the syncronization of the score with the picture.&#8221; In short, this person is usually involved from the outset of post-production and may be intimately involved with placing temp music into the film, recording and notating the spotting notes at a spotting session between you and the director, and finally, placing and syncronizing the recorded, mixed, and finalized score stems into the film itself for dubbing. Many of the duties handled by an independent film composer (one who is essentially doing it *all* on his/her own) would otherwise be handled by the music editor, thus taking some of the load off the shoulders of the composer and allowing him/her to focus solely on writing and recording the score.
<p></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>You don&#8217;t have a ton of time to write the score.</strong> It&#8217;s becoming pretty typical with any film, but almost certainly with an independent film, we as composers do not have a lot of time to do our jobs when the locked cut is finally handed over. There have even been times for me when I was already on the scoring stage on an indie film and here comes Mr. Director with a new cut that nobody but him and the editor knew about until&#8230; now.
<p></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>You don&#8217;t have a ton of money in the music budget.</strong> Duh! Helllooooo! Money in the post-production budget for music on an independent film? What in the hell is that?
<p></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>You have adequately immersed yourself in the material.</strong> As a competent composer, you have to develop the discipline of <em>getting under</em> the material so that you have a solid understanding of the story&#8217;s arc at a core level. Try for a second to understand the difference between &#8220;scoring <em>through</em> a film&#8221; versus simply &#8220;scoring a film&#8221;. There is a huge difference, and a lot of the difference comes from your ability to get the material into your headspace either through the script, the concept drawings or storyboards, or the locked cut. Bottom line: You must have enough of a love of the characters in your story to warrant you being trusted with them for this period of time. If you don&#8217;t care, your music will tattle on you — I promise!<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">So, assuming all of those — or at least one or two of them — are in place, here are some things I do when I am roadmapping a score to insure that I don&#8217;t get too far ahead of myself before realizing that I should have taken &#8220;that left toyn at Albuquerque.&#8221;</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>ORGANIZE YOUR LOGISTICS</strong><br />
Let&#8217;s first define what we are hired to do: <strong><em>Write music</em></strong>. That&#8217;s it. Nothing more, nothing less. We are the music people. However, we all know that there are way more things involved in scoring for a feature than just simply writing the music, don&#8217;t we? There are probably hundreds of little tiny nagging tasks that must be done daily in our studios in order than we might concentrate fully on writing score. I&#8217;m talking about phone calls, emails, notes, mailings, <a class="zem_slink" title="File Transfer Protocol" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">FTP</a> deliveries, invoicing, etc. Those all fall into what I would consider only one single set of administrative duties.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">The other set consists of things that are directly related to the main task of writing the music: Spotting the film; organizing spotting notes; keeping track of reel splits; scheduling live sessions; notating edit changes; interfacing with music editors, recording engineers, and mixers; and, last but certainly not least, keeping track of how much music you have left to write and how much time you have to write it in.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><em><strong>Cue Log Manager and Cue Chronicle</strong></em><br />
Luckily, there are a couple of killer software programs that can handle that entire last paragraph for you. The first one is a little number called <em><strong>Cue Log Manager (CLM)</strong></em>. CLM is a <a class="zem_slink" title="FileMaker" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileMaker">Filemaker Pro</a> database application that allows you to keep track of a film score, television score, or game score project from spotting to delivery. It was developed by Dino Herrmann and Daniel Hamuy, the team behind the popular &#8220;Powerkeys&#8221; DAW add-on.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: inherit; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"><a style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm12M4soB1I/AAAAAAAAAeE/NTPT2blbtBA/s1600-h/Picture+17.png"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm12M4soB1I/AAAAAAAAAeE/NTPT2blbtBA/s320/Picture+17.png" border="0" alt="" /></a></span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">I use CLM everyday in my studio and I like it for its clean layout, easy to understand functionality, and ability (through Filemaker) to put on a shared server and run with all of my workstations in my studio, enabling them to access to the most up-to-date info on where we are on projects. CLM features a simple layout which includes several &#8220;screensets&#8221; to work from, beginning with the Project Database. </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">The Project Database is an                  overall view of your project which enables you to track the status                  of each cue in the project. You can see if each cue has been composed,                  approved, orchestrated, recorded or which musician already recorded                  in each cue. </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">You can label your cues by usage, description, genre or style                  fields to help identify them within the project, and you can also </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">track                  multiple ensembles (orchestra, band, jazz trio, etc), as well as oversee </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">a detail view of what cues will be recorded                  in which session. The database will automatically calculate                  how many minutes of music need to be recorded per session, providing for you all of the information necessary to then organize the session more efficiently. CLM also allows                  for multiple sessions per day, as well as a great &#8220;Change                  Session Date&#8221; script that makes changing the date and time                  of a session and its related cues a snap.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><em>Cue Log Manager</em> also acts as a &#8220;Virtual Music Editor&#8221;, giving you the ability to </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">dynamically create Spotting Notes, Summary Sheets                  and Cue Sheets for your project as it evolves. The <em>spotting notes</em> feature displays start times, stop times,                  length, usage and a short description of each cue as well as length                  totals; the <em>summary sheet</em> option provides a quick overview of all                  the cues in a project and their length and usage; and the <em>cue list</em> page shows a list of each cue in a project with                  all the composer and publisher information as well as length and                  usage, serving as a worksheet for Performing                  Royalty Organizations (such as ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC) cue sheets.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><em>Cue Log Manager</em> is available for Apple computers running Filemaker Pro 8 or 9 in at least Mac OS 10.3.9. It retails online at the <a href="http://www.powerkeys.com/cuelogmanager.html">Powerkeys website</a> for $89 US.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><em><strong>Cue Chronicle</strong></em>, invented by Hollywood ProTools recordist Vincent Cirilli, is also worth taking a look at. <em>Cue Chronicle</em> differs greatly from Cue Log Manager in that it is offerred both as a Filemaker database and also as a standalone runtime application. It is also offers two unique and smart ways to license the application, which I&#8217;ll explain in a minute.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: inherit; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"><a style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm18IQ4vNkI/AAAAAAAAAeM/s0BjOd3lcT8/s1600-h/clistv3.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm18IQ4vNkI/AAAAAAAAAeM/s0BjOd3lcT8/s320/clistv3.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">Built certainly more with larger format studio scoring sessions in mind, </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><em>Cue Chronicle (CC)</em> is extensively more user definable than Cue Log Manager because of the way that Vinnie has created it. CC&#8217;s database is hugely modular which enables the entire app to function like a &#8220;central nervous system&#8221; for your scoring projects, including whole workspaces devoted soley to indivudual aspects of a scoring project like <em>crew</em>, <em>rigs</em>, <em>drives</em>, <em>reels</em>, <em>contacts</em>, and <em>notes</em>. The vast toolbox of checklists and itemizable charts include important variables such as version tracking, revision tracking, timing changes, takes, tracksheets for recording, and orchestral breakdown with a deep section allowing you to list and keep track of your instrumentation per cue. Everything is color-coded to make it easy to see and simple to monitor at quick glance, and with many fields user-definable, <em>Cue Chronicle</em> makes it pretty difficult to run out of ways to sort content.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">While Cue Log Manager utilizes a simple challenge and response licensing scheme, <em>Cue Chronicle</em> gives you a choice to tether your license to a particular machine in your studio OR tether the license to a USB memory stick enabling you to travel with the license and software from studio to studio, stage to stage. Pretty handy.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><em>Cue Chronicle</em> is available from <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/vcirilli/CueChronicle/index.html">Vincent Cirrilli&#8217;s website</a> and is downloadable for $295 US. It runs on Apple PPC or Intel computers running OS 10.4 and higher, and the optional Filemaker Pro v8 (v9 recommended).<br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>FINDING YOUR &#8220;SPOT&#8221;</strong><br />
When I was just getting started, the biggest problem I had with scoring a film from beginning to end was knowing where the best places were to put music. I was never quite sure early on if I was placing music in the film where the music should *really* be placed, or if I was just sort of guessing as best I could with no real idea of what I was doing. It took me awhile to get really great at spotting. The big problem for me was that I had a very difficult time seeing the entire score as a representative whole from top to bottom. When I would work, I would start writing whichever cue was calling me at the time, not really paying much attention to what I was doing in terms of continuity and sequence. At the end of writing the score, I would invariably end up forgetting something in the thrid or the fourth reel and then having to go back and write what I should have remembered to do while I was there the first time! It was very hard for me to see the overall &#8220;big picture&#8221; when I was needing to be so tunnel-visioned into what I was doing.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">If you have issues with not knowing whether or not you are covering everything you need to cover in your scores, or if you are having trouble spotting things on your own, let me offer this as a tip that might help get you thinking about how spotting can help you, and not scare you. You might have seen directors use this method that I am going to describe, but I learned it from an editor that I once worked with that has been using the method of storyboarding on <em><strong>Post-It Notes</strong></em> for the vast majority of his career.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">The idea of the <em>Post-It Note Score Storyboard</em> is to take a section of a wall in your writing room (as big a section as you can part with) and use it sort of as a big huge &#8220;map&#8221; for the storyline, characters, and arc of the film in relation to the musical cues that you will write to coalese with those points on your &#8220;map&#8221;. If you&#8217;ve ever watched or seen a director storyboard a camera shot, then you already know what I am talking about. Its not so much about storyboarding the musicality of a cue as much as it is about storyboarding the cue itself in the timeline of the film&#8217;s story arc.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">Start by taking a stack of standard canary yellow Post-It Notes and writing on each note a single event in the film that you feel is pivotal. &#8220;KISS&#8221; would be the key here: Keep It Simple! On one note you might write the words, &#8220;First Day/Harry Gets Up&#8221;. Another might say, &#8220;Car Won&#8217;t Start&#8221;. Yet another might say, &#8220;Julianne Misses Her Bus&#8221;. Be <em>specific</em> and be <em>generous</em> — you can always get rid of the events that you won&#8217;t write cues for, but once you have evrything up in the timeline, it will be hard to add events without moving all of the subsequent events down the line to compensate.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: inherit; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"><a style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm2HISzz2rI/AAAAAAAAAec/blm8YqBMJoU/s1600-h/warroom09.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm2HISzz2rI/AAAAAAAAAec/blm8YqBMJoU/s200/warroom09.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">Arrange these canary yellow &#8220;timeline&#8221; notes on the wall, left to right, in the sequence in which they occur as the film plays out. After you are finished, you should have a visual representation of the film&#8217;s timeline made up of yellow Post-It Notes.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">After you have the whole film represented with the canary yellow notes, take another stack of Post-Its that is a decidely different color from the yellow ones you just used to timeline the film. Maybe these are going to be Hot Pink. Designate these Hot Pink notes as the &#8220;cues&#8221; of your score. Take yet <em>another</em> set of a different color (green, orange, blue, purple&#8230; whatever floats your boat!) and make that your &#8220;Theme&#8221; color. Take a third set of a different color still and make these your &#8220;Motif&#8221; notes. You get the picture.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">Then, loosely decide (because I promise, you&#8217;ll change your mind about twenty million times!) where to put the hot pink CUE notes on the yellow timeline. Once that set has been exhausted, grab your THEME color and place those over the CUE notes where you think a main theme or character theme would be nice. After that, take you MOTIF color and place some of those over the THEME notes where you think your <em>Main Motif</em> might work nicley and communicate what&#8217;s happening in a scene. Pretty soon, after a lot of going back and forth, sticking and unsticking, moving and shuffling, you&#8217;ll have a fairly decent jumping-off point in which to begin scoring your new feature.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">Use this method to really experiment and try stuff you don&#8217;t think you should try! Often, those are the happiest of accidents and sometimes end up being the catalysts by which inspiration is born&#8230; and Oscars are awarded!</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">These are only a couple of ideas I have to get you thinking about your workflow and how maybe you can either make it more efficient (Cue Log Manager or Cue Chronicle) or dance outside the fire a bit with regards to how you plan your scores (Post-It Note spotting). I&#8217;d like to hear your ideas for mixing up your workflow in your studios and writing rooms&#8230;.</span></div>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>I defy any reader of SCOREcast Online to submit a term, in the comments, that I can&#8217;t make relevant in some way to film scoring.</strong></p>
<p>Leave your entry in the comments; I&#8217;ll do my part by replying with the connection (as quickly as I can: if there&#8217;s a deluge of comments—and I hope there will be!—it&#8217;ll take me a little while to summon the cleverness to reply to them all).</p>
<p>Your term can be any (G-rated, please) word or phrase. For example:<br />
Your term: <strong>Trafalgar Square</strong>.</p>
<div>My response: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafalgar_Square">Trafalgar Square</a>, located in central London, is a public forum for the display of art, just as film scoring is the display of our art (film music) in a public forum (the film itself). It is an intersection point—of major London thoroughfares—just as film composing is the intersection of many disparate elements—music, storytelling, technology, etc. Like the best film music, Trafalgar Square is easily accessible to anyone—a reminder that making your music connect to the audience requires a similarly clear point of access.</p>
<p>Like our composing rigs, Trafalgar Square is in a constant state of re-invention to integrate the latest technology (the most recent work to Trafalgar Square being a pump system and LED lighting, installed in May 2009).</p>
<p>Finally, Trafalgar Square, like the career of film music, must contend with the ongoing issue of congestion: a multitude of people trying to get in, with room for only so many at any given time. :-)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m betting you won&#8217;t be able to stump me. Maybe in the future we&#8217;ll do this contest with voting and prizes and all of that; for now, though, it&#8217;s simply respect that&#8217;s at stake. (What am I getting into here?!)</p>
<p>The cut-off time for this challenge is Sunday at 11:59 P.M., Los Angeles time (i.e., submissions arriving on Monday morning won&#8217;t be answered).</p>
<p>So get busy, SCOREcasters—hit me with your best shot.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><strong> I dare you.</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="plus-one-wrap"><g:plusone size="medium" href="../../../2009/07/workflow-ideas-build-your-own-temp.html"></g:plusone></div><p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sig-ogden2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-674" title="sig-ogden" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sig-ogden2.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>Do you ever wonder &#8220;why&#8221; a piece of music works in a scene? Does it just bug the ever-loving crap out you, like it does me, when you play your hard work for your director only to have him or her look at you blankly and utter the words &#8220;That just doesn&#8217;t work for me&#8221;?</p>
<p>I hate hearing those words come out of my director&#8217;s mouth. I want him or her to be pleased on first listen. Of course, it doesn&#8217;t always work that way and it is our job as the composer to find out why it doesn&#8217;t work that way. Music is so subjective and so personal that I often wonder privately things I&#8217;d never share with anyone, like &#8220;Who beat the hell out of this director so bad as a child to make him not like this cue for this scene?&#8221;</p>
<p>I have traversed far and wide to search out all possible answers to the question as to why, if you line five directors up against a wall and ask them to watch a scene with music, will you get five differing answers from each. This, of course, is an unanswerable question&#8230; perhaps answered only by discovering why *you* hear music the way you hear it and particularly why certain music, to your ears, would never fit in a certain scene.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all sat and listened to film scores independent of film to hear what others are doing or to study the greats and learn from them. The problem with that — and arguably, the problem with the concept of &#8220;film music critics&#8221; — is that the purpose and function of a piece of film music is essentially null and void when divorced from picture. With that rational, the very act of listening to a piece of film detached from the picture from whence it came is only half the story. It might be a nice listening experience, but you are still only getting part of the intended result.</p>
<p>My girlfriend is a <a class="zem_slink" title="Costume designer" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costume_designer">costume designer</a>. Our lives are a whirlwind of film events, one after the other, hers then mine then hers then mine. Recently, for the first time, I scored a film where she was also the principle wardrobe supervisor during production. It was a great experience seeing her styling and coloring choices explode onscreen while my music passed by in the underscore. As creatives, our workflows are similar, with slight differences. When I am working on menial administrative tasks like cutting demos, returning emails, or prepping my assistant&#8217;s schedule for the next week, I listen to film scores via my iTunes library. In another part of the house is my her workspace. When she is taking care of all of the administrative duties that her business requires, she watches movies on DVD or our Apple TV&#8230; with the volume turned <em>off</em>.</p>
<p>I always found this incredibly interesting&#8230; she watches movies with no sound. Seems weird, until you remember that she&#8217;s not listening for score, FX, or dialog&#8230; she&#8217;s looking at <em>costumes</em>.</p>
<p>Her process — in its entirety, from conception of a costume to the final product being fitted on the actor — completely blows me away and fascinates me. I have taken many cues from the way she works and incorporated many of her routines into my way of working as a composer. In addition, I have taken the way that she studies film and tried to apply it to the way I study film. What has resulted is a mash-up of looking at film and music in an effort to better understand why it is that music works why it is that sometimes it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Here is what it looks like: From time to time — and *only* with time to burn, mind you — I&#8217;ll put on an old movie or a recent release and turn the sound completely <em>off</em>. Then I&#8217;ll launch my iTunes library and set the filter controls so that only MY music shows up in the browser. As the film plays, I&#8217;ll &#8220;temp&#8221; my music into the film by simply pushing &#8220;PLAY&#8221; when a scene comes up that I feel needs music. I&#8217;ll experiment — I&#8217;ll put things in that I think would fit well, or put things in that are completely from another genre just to see what works and what&#8230; um&#8230; doesn&#8217;t. (Imagine &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" title="Seven (film)" rel="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt114369/">SE7EN</a>&#8221; with tunes from that <em>sports comedy</em> you just finished!)</p>
<p>This process teaches me a TON. Not only do I learn what not to do, but I have also learned that in film music, and filmmaking in general, there are *no* rules. Everything is on the table. Therefore, sometimes, a serious scene works better with a comedic score or a slightly quirkier feel to the music. Conversely, we&#8217;ve all seen many great film composer legends play against comedy with a serious tone in the accompanying score.</p>
<p>Playing around with these kinds of things really enables you to learn &#8220;privately&#8221; and make mistakes on your own dime that canand should NEVER be made on your director&#8217;s.</p>
<p>This is one small, and maybe silly, way to &#8220;think&#8221; about how film music works and how it won&#8217;t&#8230; but it <em>&#8220;works for me&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p>What works for you?</p>

<div>Audiobro has beat them to the punch and is out now,and has a deal if you buy now.</div>
<div>Check it out and let us know your thoughts, and would you buy this or upgrade what you currently have?</div>

What is <a class="zem_slink" title="64-bit" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit">64-bit</a>? Why do I care? </span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 100%;"> </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;"> </span></p>
<p>Well, the short answer is that for most of your work you shouldn’t care, but if you are using large sample libraries, stick around.<br />
<span style="font-family: arial;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-family: georgia;"><strong><em>Editorial note:</em></strong><em> I won’t get into all the things needed to make your computer 64-bit ready. There are many great computer articles and discussions based on your type of computer. Suffice it to say, to completely take advantage of 64-bit architecture your machine needs to have 64-bit processors and architecture. You need a 64-bit <a class="zem_slink" title="Operating system" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">OS</a> and 64-bit applications, not to mention drivers, etc.</em></span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: georgia;"><em><br />
</em></span><br />
<span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-family: georgia;"><em><span style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">The Details- <span style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit</a></span></span></em></span></span></p>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">I won’t make this too technical. In computers we deal with binary numbers and fixed memory (<a class="zem_slink" title="Random-access memory" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">RAM</a>) limitations based on the architecture of your computer. </span><span style="font-size: 100%;"> </span><span style="font-size: 100%;">32-bit architectures and memory space basically gives your computer the ability to use up to 4GB of RAM. </span><span style="font-size: 100%;"> </span><span style="font-size: 100%;">Now 64-bit offers 2</span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><sup>64</sup></span><span style="font-size: 100%;"> addresses, equivalent to approximately 17.2 billion <a class="zem_slink" title="Gigabyte" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte">gigabytes</a>, 16.8 million </span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terabyte">terabytes</a></span><span style="font-size: 100%;">, or 16 </span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exabyte">exabytes</a></span><span style="font-size: 100%;"> of RAM. Now that’s a whole lot of memory&#8230; enough to score using every sample library in existence all loaded in RAM.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">For everyday use, checking email and reading SCOREcastOnline.com, 32-bit memory is just fine. Only when we start using programs that access large amounts of data, (samples, photos, <a class="zem_slink" title="High-definition video" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_video">HD video</a> and geographic type data) we want as much of this data in RAM as possible, so we don’t have to keep going back to the hard drive to get more. By having more RAM available, it’s faster to compose by allowing your whole or majority of your orchestral library loaded and ready to go in RAM for the fastest access possible. Don’t confuse this with disk streaming. (Another way to get large sample libraries to play with limited amounts of RAM.)</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Even with these basics, there are always additional technical considerations and exceptions. </span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><strong>For example:</strong></span><span style="font-size: 100%;"> The Mac platform has touted a 64-bit architecture even though the 64-bit version of <a class="zem_slink" title="Mac OS X" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X">OSX</a> “Snow Leopard” is not even released yet. The Mac has been able to address more than 4GB of physical RAM for a while now. The low level kernel and drivers use 32-bits and each process or application can address 4GB of RAM. This is why you can have many applications and large amounts of data open in excess of 4GB.</span></span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">So your new computer has 8GB of physical RAM, you load up your wonderful template including your soft sampler that you learned from our last lesson. You are working on your score and you need to add another choir section. </span><span style="font-size: 100%;"> </span><span style="font-size: 100%;">You load the samples, but now you’re out of memory. You may get a memory error or even an application crash. How is this possible?</span></span></span></span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">I have 8 GB of RAM. Well this is the problem we all face when running 32 bit systems. Even though I physically have 8GB, my application or <a class="zem_slink" title="Digital audio workstation" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation">DAW</a> can only use ~4GB of it.</span></span></span></span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">At this point you may have to try and free up some memory or try to print/bounce some of your parts to audio. This is not a great workflow enhancer. We need a way to be able to load large amounts or samples into RAM to make our jobs composing more efficient and to better improve the workflow.</span></span></span></span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; font-weight: bold;">Enter 64-bit</span></span></span></span></span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">If you had a 64-bit system and enough physical RAM, you could have enough RAM to load samples to your hearts content. “That’s great Randy, you say, but I don’t have a 64-bit system and I am running out of memory now, what can I do?”</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Until you’re ready to move to 64-bit, there are a few solutions that can help you right now improve your sampler workflow, lets talk about one.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Currently, a few Soft Sampler companies have offered 64–bit stand alone versions, (Vienna, Kontakt 3.5 and EastWest Play) but most stand alone 32-bit versions can be used outside or in conjunction with your DAW application. Audio can be routed inter-application with programs like Soundflower or Jack on OSX. But my current favorite is Plouge’s </span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><a href="http://www.plogue.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=35">Bidule</a></span><span style="font-size: 100%;">.</span></span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Bidule is a stand-alone audio development platform. It’s available on both Mac and PC and gives you the ability to build DSP based effects, route and playback audio, and use plug-ins and instruments.

I have my DAW loaded with a few instances of soft samplers loaded with basic percussion, strings, drums, horns, and other keyboard effects. This allows me some CPU room for audio tracks and other plug-ins to use. I quickly can get close to the RAM limit just in my DAW, even though my computer physically has 14 GB of RAM. So I use Bidule via rewire in combination with my DAW. I’m using other instances of plugs, including Mach 5v2, Kontakt 3 and a few extra drum plugs.

I want to know how I can create various timbres, textures, and effects – that communicate emotions and moods – using combinations of instruments and playing techniques.  By studying scores, listening to performances, and emulating, I aim to unlock the secrets of great composers who, either long ago or recently, have written music that moves my soul.  At the same time, I&#8217;m striving to perfect the methods I use to mock up complete orchestras and scores, using my <a class="zem_slink" title="Digital audio workstation" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation">DAW</a>, studio gear, and collection of virtual instruments.  These methods are an important part of my overall <span style="font-style: italic;">composing workflow</span> – this month’s theme.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">An Alternative to Samples</span><br />
[<span style="font-style: italic;">In the following discussion, I assume you have some familiarity with DAWs, virtual instrument (VI) plugins, <a class="zem_slink" title="Musical Instrument Digital Interface" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_Instrument_Digital_Interface">MIDI</a>, and the use of sample libraries.</span>]</p>
<p>You’ve heard it’s important to make your MIDI mockups as realistic as you can.  Perhaps, when you hear <span style="font-style: italic;">realistic</span>, you think <span style="font-style: italic;">sample libraries</span>.  What VI could sound more realistic than one based on recordings of an actual acoustic instrument?</p>
<p>It’s a good thought, but <a class="zem_slink" title="Sampling (music)" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_%28music%29">sampling</a> technology has its limitations.  In this article, I discuss some of these disadvantages and explore an alternative technology, based on a form of <span style="font-style: italic;"><a class="zem_slink" title="Additive synthesis" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_synthesis">additive synthesis</a></span>, that might better suit some of your needs.  Sample-based VIs play back instrument waveforms that were previously captured verbatim and stored in a library.   In contrast, additive synthesis is a particular way of <span style="font-style: italic;">mathematically modeling</span> the acoustic waves produced by a real instrument and the instrument-dependent manner in which these waves change in response to input (e.g., breath, bowing, fingering, etc.).  When you need to hear the instrument’s sound, the model is used to <span style="font-style: italic;">compute </span>a waveform on the fly.  This waveform doesn’t purport to be identical to the waveform the real instrument would have produced, but does aim to be perceptually very similar.</p>
<p>An effective variant of this modeling technique is the basis of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Wallander Interactive Virtual Instrument</span> (WIVI) family, offered by <a href="http://www.wallanderinstruments.com/">Wallander Instruments</a>.  Existing WIVIs are explicitly oriented toward those composing for traditional instruments (though you can invent non-traditional ones).  The combination of features offered by WIVIs is certainly intriguing, if not unique in the current marketplace.  Instrument rendition is better than skeptical sampling addicts might expect, and in my own case, is often closer to my expectations than what I get from my samples.  If I don’t like what I’m hearing, I can probably improve it, because WIVI sound is highly malleable.  If you’ve ever tried tweaking MIDI mockups to sound more realistic, you know how important this can be, but may have noted that sampling technology offers limited adjustability at a detailed level.  Most striking is that when you combine multiple WIVIs into orchestral ensembles, the result doesn’t sound “phasey”, organ-like, or otherwise unnatural, but rather convincingly realistic.  Wallander attributes this to slight randomization of several attributes of each instrument’s sound, calling this feature <span style="font-style: italic;">performance randomization</span>.</p>
<p>I’m actually using brass and woodwind WIVIs, in addition to sampling and several other technologies, in my studio right now.   If you’re trying to decide how to spend your precious dollars and time, learning about WIVIs might aid your decision process.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Computational Issues, and System Cost</span><br />
Let’s compare WIVIs with sampling-based VIs, beginning with computing requirements.  Typical sample libraries contain many gigabytes of sample data.  Most sample data must be read from disk, in real time, at the moment it’s needed.  If you’re running many sample-based VIs (i.e., to mock up a full orchestra), you need one or more big, fast disks dedicated to your sample libraries.  You likely need more than 4 Gbytes of <a class="zem_slink" title="Random-access memory" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">RAM</a> to buffer your sample data, and since a 32-bit <a class="zem_slink" title="Central processing unit" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a> can address a maximum of 4 Gbytes, you probably need a 64-bit CPU and OS.  Your computer needs a fast, wide datapath to move huge amounts of data from disk to RAM quickly enough.  These requirements mean increased system expense and probable support headaches.  But WIVIs, unlike sample-based instruments, don’t move massive amounts of data from disk to RAM.  They’re able to run on much more modest computers, even many laptops.</p>
<p>Sample-based VI plugins pre-load considerable sample data into RAM when they’re initialized.  You see this when start up your DAW – if you load a project with a large number of sampled VI plugins, you may have to wait up to several minutes before all plugins are ready and you can start working.  This doesn’t happen with WIVIs, since they pre-load relatively little data.  You get near-instant gratification.</p>
<p>“But,” you say, “I’ve already invested in a big machine to run samples, and I just go for coffee when starting up my DAW.  So why should <span style="font-style: italic;">I</span> care?”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Achieving Realism</span><br />
I’ve already explained that the <span style="font-style: italic;">performance randomization</span> feature of each WIVI is crucial to the illusion of realism when WIVIs are combined into ensembles.  This is not only a matter of mimicking the imperfections of human players, but also counteracts adverse sonic effects that occur when combining sounds are too highly correlated, effects you <span style="font-style: italic;">don’t</span> hear when listening to real ensembles.  WIVI-style randomization may be the most important single factor in the ability of WIVIs to achieve realistic orchestral sound.</p>
<p>But there’s much more.  Consider any wind instrument, for example.  With the real wind instrument, you know that when you blow harder, the sound gets louder but <span style="font-style: italic;">also </span>changes in timbre.  When playing expressively, it’s second nature for a musician to vary his or her instrument’s sound – in <span style="font-style: italic;">both </span>amplitude and timbre – within single notes, as well as from note to note.  Because WIVIs are based on a model that permits both amplitude and timbre to be varied at <span style="font-style: italic;">any </span>time, in response to breath pressure, they can reproduce this behavior and thereby lend themselves to achieving more natural-sounding playing.  Sample-based VIs don’t have this capability – you’re able to vary amplitude within a note (e.g., by varying CC11), but timbre doesn’t vary naturally along with it.  Likewise, whereas a WIVI models the way a real wind instrument’s pitch varies as a function of breath pressure, sample-based VIs cannot do so.  Vibrato?  WIVIs let you add that, as well, with continuous control over several pertinent parameters.  Breath noise, key noise, attack, release, and those all-important <span style="font-style: italic;">note transitions</span>?  Just about anything you’d like to be able to vary (or not vary), you can.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Whence Articulations?</span><br />
You’re probably used to seeing sample libraries that offer many different “articulations” for a given instrument.  That’s a big part of how they attempt to facilitate realism.  WIVIs aren’t set up that way, because with their inherent control capabilities you can <span style="font-style: italic;">create </span>just about any articulation you need.  In contrast, if a sample library doesn’t have the articulation you need, or the variant provided doesn’t sound right, you’re stuck.  Trills are a good example.  A typical sample library provides canned, half- and whole-step trills.  But you know trills can be played in different ways to enhance expression – imagine wanting to imitate the uneven fluttering of a butterfly.  WIVIs let you design your own trills, and each one can be unique if you’d like.  Same for any other articulation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you want to speed your workflow, a WIVI lets you create your own library of <span style="font-style: italic;">re-usable</span> articulations, using what are called <span style="font-style: italic;">Smart Sequences</span>.  You can then set up a keyswitch to call up any articulation at any time, just as you can with many sample libraries.  Taking advantage of this and other WIVI flexibilities requires work and skill – but the point is: <span style="font-style: italic;">you can do it</span>.  That’s often <span style="font-style: italic;">not </span>true with sample libraries.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ensembles</span><br />
I haven’t mentioned the unique interactive interface you get when you purchase any WIVI instrument bundle (brass, woodwind, and sax bundles are currently available, with more planned).  Besides letting you adjust any WIVI parameter (many of which can also be set in real time via MIDI), the interface graphically depicts a performance space (such as a hall, studio, church, or anechoic chamber) in which you can place either a single WIVI instrument or an <span style="font-style: italic;">ensemble </span>of like or different instruments relative to an imaginary listener.  The position of each instrument relative to the listener establishes stereo pan, of course.  But since acoustics of the depicted performance space are modeled, too, position also affects the ratios of direct sound, early reflections, and late reflections, and therefore the depth of each player within the perceived acoustic space.  And if this reverberation implementation doesn’t suit your purposes, there is a way to bypass it and eliminate the pertinent computations, without losing the panning setup.  I’m doing this because I need to use my WIVIs along with sample-based VIs from other vendors and I want all these instruments to run through a common reverb setup.</p>
<p>If you prefer, you can put each instrument instance in its own plugin.  But if you like to streamline your workflow by using instrument ensembles, you may find WIVI ensembles to be a great asset.  First, you can design your own polyphonic ensemble.  By comparison, sample libraries usually offer only a limited selection of ensembles.  Second, you can put an ensemble into a single plug-in instance if you like, which optimizes computational efficiency.  Each instrument can be assigned to a different MIDI channel for individual control (subject to the usual 16-channel limit), or they can all be assigned to the same channel, or anything in between.  Third, if several instruments are assigned to the <span style="font-style: italic;">same </span>MIDI channel, you can take advantage of Wallander’s <span style="font-style: italic;">polyphonic mode</span> to automatically assign parts of chords to different instruments in the ensemble – potentially saving you a lot of work.  Controls in the interface allow you to specify the rules by which this is done.  Fantastic.</p>
<p>If you’d like to see polyphonic mode and many other WIVI features in action, check out the <a href="http://www.wallanderinstruments.com/">Polyphonic Mode demo</a> on the Wallander home page.  Scroll down to the bottom of the page to find the demo.  For a more intimate experience that lets you try out <span style="font-style: italic;">all </span>of the WIVIs, I suggest the Wallander Instruments demo available at <a href="http://try-sound.com/">Try-Sound.com</a>.  And a free <a href="http://www.wallanderinstruments.com/?menu=products&amp;download_trial=1">WIVI Trial Edition</a>, downloadable from the Wallander site, includes the complete interactive environment and several (but not all) of the available WIVIs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scope of the WIVI Family</span><br />
What about the range of WIVI instruments available?  You’ve probably noticed I haven’t said anything about <span style="font-style: italic;">strings </span>so far.  That’s because there is no string product at the present time.  Wallander is well aware of this, and is known to be considering adding strings to the WIVI family.  Unfortunately, it seems doubtful that string WIVIs will appear soon, due to the complexity of the undertaking.  For now, I’m using sampled strings – and percussion instruments, for that matter – from other vendors.  They mix fine with my WIVIs, though I have to put up with the slow load times and realism disadvantages associated with sample libraries.</p>
<p>Coverage of woodwinds is excellent, as 13 different types are available (in three bundles) with three or more variations of each.  In fact, in a project I’m working on, I needed an E-flat clarinet, for which a WIVI exists.  I own many sample libraries from one of the major vendors, but none of them offers this instrument.  Another major vendor’s sample library offers it, but the cost of adding it to my collection is high.  This was one of the factors that pushed me to try using WIVIs, and I’m very pleased with the result.  Similar situations exist with other “specialty” instruments.</p>
<p>There are two WIVI saxophone bundles, covering 9 different sax types.  I don’t have these yet, so I can’t say much about them.</p>
<p>Four WIVI brass instrument types are available at present, in the Brass 1 bundle.  However, if you take account of all the muted variations of the basic types, the WIVI Brass 1 bundle can actually be thought of as including 23 distinct instrument types.  Adding another bundle of brass instruments is said to be high in Wallander’s priorities.</p>
<p>By the way, you can buy a <a href="http://www.sweetwater.com/store/search.php?s=WIVI&amp;go=Go%21"><span style="font-style: italic;">WIVI Epic Bundle</span></a> which includes <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> of the WIVIs currently available, at a large discount relative to the sum of the separate bundle prices.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">WIVI in the School of Chops</span><br />
I’m putting my WIVIs, sample libraries, DAW, computer, and skills to the test with a large project:  sequencing Stravinsky’s <span style="font-style: italic;">The Rite Of Spring</span>.  Great for my School of Chops objectives.  I’m reaching for the Holy Grail:  being able to have the entire orchestra running in one, unified environment (one computer running Cubase 5), with everything available to be edited at any time – i.e., no tracks frozen.  So far, so good.  At the moment, my orchestra incorporates 38 woodwind and brass WIVIs, as well as sampled strings.  I haven’t added percussion yet.  Although I have a 64-bit computer and OS (Vista Ultimate), I’ve found it advantageous to run the orchestra under the 32-bit version of Cubase 5.  This is because all presently-available WIVIs operate in 32-bit mode.  They also run under 64-bit Cubase 5, but then Steinberg’s <a href="http://knowledgebase.steinberg.net/262_1.html">VST Bridge</a> comes into play, creating significant overhead.  Fortunately, by using relatively little RAM, my WIVIs help keep the memory used by my 32-bit plugins below the 4 Gbyte limit.  Right now, until I add more plugins, I’m using about 25% or less of all eight of my CPU cores, and about 3.2 Gbytes of RAM out of 16 Gbytes available.  So there’s still headroom.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bottom Lines</span><br />
Of course, you want to know how my WIVIs <span style="font-style: italic;">sound</span>.  Overall, I’m very happy with them.  Most of the instruments sound <span style="font-style: italic;">very </span>good.  The jury is out regarding a few, which seem to sound more “breathy” and less resonant than I expect.  I’ve been working around this problem with EQ – but there are a <span style="font-style: italic;">lot </span>of WIVI parameters I haven’t mastered yet, and it may be that I can get closer to what I need by adjusting them.  WIVIs <span style="font-style: italic;">should </span>sound realistic, because the parameters of the model on which each one is based have been derived by automatic analysis of real instrument waveforms.  And Arne Wallander is a smart guy.</p>
<p>Though I’ve focused on WIVIs in this article, my purpose has been to get you thinking about alternatives to sampling, with due recognition that there are worthy model-based products other than WIVIs on the market, and that sampling still has its place.</p>
<p>There is probably a lot more to talk about, but I think it’s best to leave that for the comments I hope many of you readers will post.  I’ll join in as needed!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="plus-one-wrap"><g:plusone size="medium" href="../../../2009/07/switched-on-studio-workflow-and-lateral.html"></g:plusone></div><p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sig-haynes.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-682" title="sig-haynes" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sig-haynes.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>Being a film composer often means having a process &#8220;locked down&#8221;. We must be able to work quickly, and make the transition from inspiration-to-perspiration-to-production in the blink of an eye. Composers like to think of themselves as &#8220;lateral thinkers&#8221;, but because of the time pressures involved we each can be as dogmatic as any specialist. It may start out as a new approach to solving a problem, but once we&#8217;ve found a unique way of getting things done, the tendency is to &#8220;box it in&#8221; and not budge from that successful path.</p>
<p>Honestly, I find that tendency to be a bit unsettling. I&#8217;m always concerned about becoming too set in my ways, mainly because it runs contrary to the reason I became a composer in the first place. And, it can mean missing out on some great new opportunities, either in discovering a new creative outlet or in bringing greater efficiency to the studio. So I&#8217;m always on the lookout for little windows of time to &#8220;break the mold&#8221;, which is not always easy. Then there are the times when the opportunity presents itself in the form of a last-minute project &#8211; and the choice is either to a) back off and recommend the gig to someone else, or b) jump in with both feet. The anecdote below is a case study in lateral thinking in the studio.</p>
<p>It all started when I got a call from a production company I&#8217;d worked with on a previous project. That first gig was to create music and sound design for the pilot of a web series. This call was about a trailer for this year&#8217;s Comic Con &#8211; for a new animated series they had been developing. It turned out that they didn&#8217;t have the right clearances to the music that was used to edit the reel sequence. So now they needed to re-bed the trailer with new music &#8211; but didn&#8217;t have time to re-cut the reel to synchronize it to the &#8220;hits&#8221;. Having the ability to replace a temp reel with original music that hits all of the cuts is part of the film composer&#8217;s stock-in-trade, but this particular project had to be completed in a matter of hours &#8211; including new sound design and a mix that was hot enough to cut through the din of a convention show floor. So the solution was to take a handful of cleared scores and composite them in a way that made it seem like the music was designed to go with the timing of the reel. My job was to connect those various elements into a seamless whole &#8211; in a few hours.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the music they provided covered the right kind of ground for the reel. I was handed three scores that were owned by the major movie studio that was assembling the master reel (a reel with multiple trailers/teasers) for the Con. One soundtrack was from a horror movie, another from a suspense thriller with a romantic element, and the third was from a straight-up action movie. Because I had one-off CDs provided by the studio, I had more cues than were released on the commercial soundtracks. This was a *really* good thing, since I wanted to use something that wasn&#8217;t immediately recognizable, and those secondary cues had the same &#8220;vibe&#8221; without being the showcase tunes that can be heard needle-dropped into every other movie trailer you see on TV. I started by skinning all of the soundtrack CDs to the project folder, then successively auditioning each cue. I used the &#8220;Sound Browser&#8221; in Nuendo that not only allowed me to rapidly move down the list of each cue &#8211; but it also displayed a peak waveform file of each cue as it was selected for preview. This meant that longer cues could be visually inspected and quickly sampled by clicking on the time line where things &#8216;got interesting&#8217;. This allowed me to move through the tracks more quickly than sitting and listening to each one end-to-end (or worse yet, listening to the first ten seconds and then skipping to the next cue, only to miss something really cool/useful at 0:11). I tagged up the files using the &#8220;rating&#8221; meta-tag in Nuendo and then sorted the selected cue by rating &#8211; then dragged that sub-set of cues into the project.</p>
<p>The reel itself goes from a &#8220;sense of wonder&#8221; vibe to an &#8220;eerie&#8221; vibe, and then into full-on &#8220;Danger! Danger!&#8221; mode before tailing off with a &#8220;Coming Soon&#8221; card on a fade. There were definitely some &#8220;hits&#8221; in the reel that I wanted to match up to, and the original temp score highlighted some of that. It was at this point that I started to think &#8220;Ya know, it would be faster and easier if I tossed these cues and just wrote this myself, end-to-end.&#8221; And quite frankly, I might have attempted it if I didn&#8217;t also have to re-build the sound design (for animation, that&#8217;s no small feat) and complete a fairly hot mix in a few hours. There were obstacles to overcome regardless of the choice I made. The obvious problems I saw with the new temp cues were in tempo and key matching. As an example: there was a place in the reel where the obvious choice was to drop in a big orchestral hit with a bowed gong (from the horror score), but it didn&#8217;t blend seamlessly with a suspense cue (from the action movie) that it dovetailed into. The tail on the hit was too long, and the suspense cue as in the wrong key. It was too late to write something for that spot myself, and the choice was to go digging through the full set of temp cues *again* (almost as time-consuming as re-scoring the scene) or work with the clips I had in front of me. This is where the &#8216;lateral thinking&#8217; came in.</p>
<p>I opted to try some of the pitch and time shifting features in Nuendo &#8211; something I&#8217;ve rarely used up to this point &#8211; definitely *not* part of my standard template. It seemed like a big dice-roll, since any other time I&#8217;ve done pitch or time-shifting to broad spectrum (i.e. full mix) material the results have always been wanting. But, people have been raving about the new MPEX 3 algorithms (licensed to Steinberg from Prosoniq) so i decided to give it a try. The end result was really great &#8211; and a huge relief once I knew I had something that could make the project work. In certain cases, it made more sense to shift a cue to a key related to but *not* matching to the the previous segment &#8211; sometimes to keep the shift interval smaller, and in other cases because it simply seemed to work better in context. There were also several tiny little timing shifts inside the cues *without* changing pitch. Having the ability to put ever-so-slight shifts on hits in the middle of a cue allowed things to really lock up with the action on-screen, and the resulting processing didn&#8217;t seem to alter the quality of music. Once the &#8216;new&#8217; temp music bed was in place, I put together the sound design and then finished the mix in the remaining hour.</p>
<p>The end result was a &#8220;score&#8221; that wasn&#8217;t too heavily dependent on any one of the three soundtracks I was given. This gave the teaser a feel of having its own vibe &#8211; and being able to match the tempo of the music to the action on-screen really helped. There&#8217;s a stark difference in tone between the &#8220;ahh&#8221; and &#8220;eek&#8221; moments &#8211; definitely more than I would have done if I had scored it myself. But it really works for this animation piece &#8211; and the client was happy with it, which of course is the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>With this experience, I go back and think about how I might have done things differently &#8211; in particular how I *might* have scored the trailer if I had the time. I&#8217;m feeling the influence of the newly assembled temp score &#8211; which ended up being quite a departure from the first temp track. I went back to the original music bed &#8211; and it seemed strangely odd and plain compared to the composite I had assembled. Because of the material I was given (and that sub-set I had selected) limited my choices, there were some musical elements &#8211; particularly some of the key relations in some sequences &#8211; that I was &#8216;forced into&#8217; that now seem right, and for the lack of a better word &#8211; &#8216;natural&#8217;. Likewise, I&#8217;ve grown much more comfortable with a set of tools that have gone unused in my studio up to now. I&#8217;ve had friends talk to me about using pitch and time shifting tools to re-edit their own music cues after the editor or director makes a late change in a film, but I&#8217;ve always mistrusted what that processing does to a finished mix. Now I feel more confident that it can be relied upon for mission-critical use when time on a project is running out.</p>
<p>So this accidental exercise in lateral thinking has been beneficial in two ways: 1) I&#8217;ll know now to broaden my options on harmonic rhythm when creating a high-energy cue, and 2) there&#8217;s a &#8220;new&#8221; tool in the kit that I&#8217;ve learned to trust when the sand is dropping through the hourglass. The icing on the cake is that the production company is talking to me about other projects, albeit with a more realistic time-line. So now it&#8217;s time to get back to work, but I think I&#8217;ll make some extra time this weekend to dust off some of the other features in my sequencer that have gone unused for too long &#8211; you never know when you&#8217;ll need it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="plus-one-wrap"><g:plusone size="medium" href="../../../2009/07/ergonomics.html"></g:plusone></div><p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sig-olszewski.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-683" title="sig-olszewski" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sig-olszewski.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>As this month’s SCOREcast theme is “Workflow”, I started thinking of the DIY STUDIO article in terms of how you may customize or optimize your system for top performance. I made some notes on RAM, hard drive speed / size / partitioning, CPU, and so on, but it degenerated into a technical soup of gear talk. And considering the purpose of DIY STUDIO is low-cost studio startups, everything I had written about required money. Neither of these is what I wanted to talk about this month.</p>
<div>Instead, I’m focusing this DIY STUDIO article on <a class="zem_slink" title="Ergonomics" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergonomics">ergonomics</a>. The word “ergonomics” derives from two Greek words: <em>Ergon</em>, meaning work, and <em>Nomos</em>, meaning “natural laws”. In short, ergonomics is the study and design of machinery and equipment people use to perform work. In addition to special keyboards, mice, and chairs that immediate come to mind when thinking ergonomics, in many cases there are several free or low-cost things you can do to improve the ergonomics of your studio. Also, I won’t get too deep into the details, but hopefully the comments and conversation in addition to the article itself will provide some great ideas.</p>
<p>First is <strong>equipment</strong>, including desks, chairs, mice, placement / orientation of equipment, and lighting. If you’re like me, you have some pretty standard office furniture for your studio. My opinion of one of the best investments you can make in your studio, after your music production equipment itself, is to get some office equipment and furniture that maximizes your comfort and minimizes the distances your arms, feet, and fingers have to move. In my own workflow, I personally find myself often doing this particular combination of right-clicking my mouse, moving down a popup menu, and selecting an item. I also do some very precise dragging with my mouse, which is probably not as efficient as it could be. I’ve found as many keyboard shortcuts as possible, but some things are just easier to <a class="zem_slink" title="Mouse (computing)" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_%28computing%29">right click</a>- maybe because my hand is already on the mouse or something. If you’re in a similar situation, consider a trackball mouse that minimizes your wrist rotation and repetitive movement. Next consider a height-adjustable desk or table for your work surface. In SCOREcast podcast #16, <a class="zem_slink" title="Deane Ogden" rel="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1676420/">Deane Ogden</a> went into great detail about his own desk. It’s awesome information; if you haven’t checked it out, you should. A good chair is also important for those all-nighter scoring sessions. I’ve found that finding a good chair is a pretty subjective thing; so if you have the opportunity, visit a place that specializes in chairs, such as <a href="http://www.relaxtheback.com/">Relax The Back</a>. Be aware though, you’ll pay good money for a good chair. Personally, I’m holding off on the chair for a while.</p>
<p>Didn’t I say “free and low-cost” solutions? Okay, enough about equipment. Second major topic is <strong>angles</strong>. Specifically, having correct angles in your workspace can greatly reduce fatigue and improve efficiency. Some important angles to check:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eyes: your monitor should be directly in front of your eyes, or slightly below, when your neck is straight and looking straight ahead.</li>
<li>Body: Your arms should fall naturally to the armrests, with your elbows bending slightly more than 90 degrees. Thighs should be parallel to the floor. Like elbows, knees should bend slightly more than 90 degrees (more like 100 degrees). Your wrists should be straight, placing your hands on your keyboard. In a music composition context, some people prefer to have the computer keyboard at this height and your synth or <a class="zem_slink" title="MIDI controller" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI_controller">MIDI controller</a> keyboard slightly higher; some prefer the opposite.</li>
<li>Reach: Try this experiment: Sit normally at your workstation, and without leaning forward or stretching, try to reach everything you’d need to do your work. If you cannot reach mostly everything (and definitely the most important stuff), then you may consider changing your setup so all the equipment you need is well within reach, without leaning.</li>
<li>Chair: Your chair should support all of the above, and should also provide support for your back from your pelvis to your shoulder blades. Your chair should be adjustable to accommodate for any angles you may need.</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing to keep in mind when adjusting the angles of your workstation, it may not feel “natural” at first. This may be because your body had become accustomed to slumping or something similar. Give it a chance to grow on you and you may find you’re able to work better, longer. But do pay attention to the aches and pains you experience, as this may be a signal that you should tweak something else.</p>
<p>Third major topic: <strong>repetition</strong>. Although probably necessary to an extent, repetitive motion is the enemy. Try to arrange your workspace that eliminates repetitive motion as much as possible. Do this by paying attention to what your hands, eyes, arms, and the rest of your body is doing as you work. If you find you repeat particular movements more than others, come up with alternatives. For example, in my mouse-clicking example, I may want to look up some more keyboard shortcuts, or even map some custom shortcuts, then alternate between mouse commands and shortcuts. If you cannot find a way to eliminate repetition, a good rule of thumb is circles are better for you than straight lines. Try to lay out your tasks or parts of your workflow in some circular fashion, to reduce muscle and ligament fatigue.</p>
<p>This article is just some general guidance, but hopefully it’ll get you started. There are plenty of other resources for more information. Here are some good “Googling” terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ergonomics</li>
<li>Engineering Psychology</li>
<li>Man-Machine Systems</li>
<li>Time-and-Motion Analysis</li>
<li>Workspace Design</li>
</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="plus-one-wrap"><g:plusone size="medium" href="../../../2009/07/comfort-is-key-please-be-seated.html"></g:plusone></div><p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sig-meghan1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-685" title="sig-meghan" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sig-meghan1.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>One of the greatest things about SCOREcast (maybe THE greatest thing about it) is that a lot of us contributors have already &#8220;been there and done that&#8221;. You can learn from our mistakes/successes. Several of us have been at this for some time, and so it&#8217;s only natural that we&#8217;ve learned certain &#8220;tricks of the trade&#8221; or &#8220;secrets&#8221;, if you will, and we are now able to pass them on in hopes that you don&#8217;t have to learn them the hard way as we once did. My aim for this Site is that you will never again have to &#8220;pay&#8221; for the knowledge that someone who has gone before you could just as easily spend 5 minutes telling you about from first-hand experience.</p>
<p>Having worked along side composers like <a class="zem_slink" title="Hans Zimmer" rel="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001877/">Hans Zimmer</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="Graeme Revell" rel="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006251/">Graeme Revell</a>, and more recently <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0413011/">Steve Jablonski</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0340003/">Rupert Gregson-Williams</a>, and SCOREcast founder <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1676420/">Deane Ogden</a>, I&#8217;ve gleaned much by watching how the big boys do it. One thing I&#8217;ve noticed about the really successful composers — They are all <span style="font-style: italic;">healthy</span>. Hans Zimmer rarely gets sick. If he does, it is the kind of sick that is over in a day, and I&#8217;ve never seen it cost him anything in terms of down time. Same with my current composer, Deane Ogden. Deane is a machine (which you know if you follow his status updates!). When Deane first hired me, one of the first things he told me was to &#8220;stay healthy. We are no good to each other if we are on our backs.&#8221;</p>
<p>How do you stay healthy in the studio? It is possible, and most of it has to do with what we are talking about this month: Workflow. Even though you are sitting for the majority of it, life in the studio can be back-breaking work. Any environment where you are spending 14+ hours a day needs to be set up in a way that accomodates a relaxing workflow&#8230; one that helps, not hinders.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent an incredible amount of carefully thought out time and energy planning and conceptualizing my studio layout for one reason: I don&#8217;t want to get hurt. I have worked in some very nice situations in this town as a scoring assistant, witnessing first-hand the most comfortable studios that money can buy along with some of the most poorly laid out studios one could imagine. I know guys that have horrible back problems that stem from sitting in cheap chairs for days. I have seen many composers have to start wearing glasses because of the activity of assailing their eyesight with poorly color-calibrated monitors while trying to get music written. Orchestrator Susie Benchasil said in a SCOREcast <a href="../../../2009/05/scorecast-no19-shownotes.html">interview</a> once that she knows a lot of people in the business that have issues of poor circulation due to simply not moving their legs enough and sitting on their posteriors for days at a time with little to no physical activity happening. Composing, it seems, can be hazardous to your health, so it&#8217;s no surprise that any composer worth his or her salt will tell you that <span style="font-style: italic;">health</span> is of optimum concern in the studio. In fact, at my old stomping grounds of Remote Control, a mandate was handed down by the Lion King himself that every composer use the same brand of desk. Hans believed that a particular desk from a particular company kept back fatigue to a minimum, so everyone was supplied with one, whether they liked it or not.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time watching how pro composers do things when I get invited into their &#8220;inner sanctums&#8221;. That is a rare treat and I never want to squander the opportunity. Since not having to re-invent the wheel is priceless knowledge to have, I&#8217;ll attempt to outline a few of the things that I&#8217;ve picked up along the way. It might take me a few posts to get in everything that I want to, but I&#8217;ll get it done. We&#8217;ll call this the first in a series for this month from me.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Musical Chairs<br />
</span>In our studio, Deane and I listen to a lot of podcasts. When we are wiring, assembling demos, or some other menial task that doesn&#8217;t require us speaking to each other for lengths at a time, we listen to what others are doing in various fields and try to apply those new ideas to our own craft, if applicable. We recently heard <a class="zem_slink" title="Stephen King" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King">Stephen King</a> say that he likens &#8220;writing in your studio to &#8216;creative sleep&#8217;.&#8221; What he meant by that is this: Everything in your bedroom is engineered to help you fall asleep so you can dream. It&#8217;s dark, the doors are locked, and the temperature is right. The pillows are the perfect softness, and comforter is just the right thickness, and the bed doesn&#8217;t have any lumps in it. Your studio should be the same way. When you close the door to your writing space, you should now be completely free of any discomforts so that you may &#8220;dream&#8221; the right score for the film.</p>
<p>The cornerstone to making this happen is the chair you are sitting in. You are in your chair for up to 14 hours a day, so you need to have one that is not good, but <span style="font-style: italic;">great</span>. Your task chair is not something you want to be cheap about, believe me. It is one of those things where you are either going to pay now, or pay later. But you <span style="font-style: italic;">will</span> pay. (Preferably in the form of dollars to a place that sells chairs and not dollars to a chiropractor!)</p>
<p>Your chair should be first of all, sturdy. These chairs that you see at places like Staples and Office Depot — those aren&#8217;t going to work. In the office furniture business, there is a lingo&#8230; much like what we have as composers. There are chairs that are specifically designed for &#8220;tasking&#8221;, and this is a paraphrase, but it basically means &#8220;jobs that are done while hunched over a workstation desk&#8221;. That&#8217;s us! When searching for the right chair for your studio, you want to be looking specifically for a &#8220;task chair&#8221;.</p>
<p>My advice would be to look at two &#8220;task chair&#8221; companies: Steel Case and Herman Miller.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/global">Herman Miller</a> is what Deane and Lee both use in their studios. At Deane&#8217;s place, we have a couple of Herman Miller <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/Products/Aeron-Chairs">Aeron Chairs</a>. These chairs are the bomb.</p>
<div class="zemanta-img zemanta-action-dragged" style="display: block; float: right; margin: 1em; width: 310px;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Aeron_chair_JN.jpg"><img style="border: medium none; display: block;" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ec/Aeron_chair_JN.jpg/300px-Aeron_chair_JN.jpg" alt="Aeron chair" width="300" height="321" /></a>Image via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Aeron_chair_JN.jpg">Wikipedia</a></div>
<p>They are a little expensive, but again, you cannot skimp on this part of your studio. Remember what I said: You&#8217;ll either pay the price now or pay the price later. Your choice. Aeron Chairs are completely adjustable and come in several different sizes. They also have one of the best warrantes in the business and Herman Millr is a trusted name in seating and has been for decades. This is not some fly-by-night mom-and-pop that will be gone tomorrow. HM chairs are everywhere — even <a class="zem_slink" title="Donald Trump" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Donald Trump</a> sits in one!</p>
<p>Herman Miller also makes a chair called the <a href="http://www.ultimatebackstore.com/product-exec/product_id/351/pn/Celle_Chair_-_Quick_Ship">Celle Chair</a>. Celle Chairs are less expensive than the Aeron Chair, but provide many of the same features such as adjustable lumbar support and adjustable armrests. The major difference between the two is that the Celle lacks the <span style="font-style: italic;">total</span> adjustability that the Aeron Chair is famous for, but if you don&#8217;t need that or you are fairly average sized, the Celle will work great for you. Plus, it is considerably less money — about $400 for a brand new Celle Chair.</p>
<p>I get Deane&#8217;s HM chairs from a company in Chicago called The Ultimate Back Store. These guys often have great deals on HM products and sometimes even have floor models they&#8217;ll sell for less, but still have the same warranty as a brand new one. They also will ship the chair for free and have service centers that will come to your studio and fix the chair should anything ever break or go wrong. (When does THAT happen ever?)</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Herman Miller Task Chairs</span><br />
Fully adjustable, comes in various sizes to fit your body type, 12-year &#8220;no-fault&#8221; warranty<br />
Price range: $400 USD (Celle) -$700 USD (Aeron)<br />
<a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/global">Herman Miller.com</a><br />
<a href="http://www.ultimatebackstore.com/">The Ultimate Back Store</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.steelcase.com/">Steel Case</a> is also another company that makes amazing task chairs. Their <a href="http://www.steelcase.com/na/leap_products.aspx?f=11852">Leap Chair</a> is a favorite at several studios I&#8217;ve worked in like Capitol Records and the Power Station in New York (which is wh<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fZp_xxfyktg/SlTTHGpP-OI/AAAAAAAAABo/E4AFclokJRw/s1600-h/steelcase.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5356137975846533346" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 203px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 203px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fZp_xxfyktg/SlTTHGpP-OI/AAAAAAAAABo/E4AFclokJRw/s320/steelcase.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>ere I first sat in one). They are a little more expensive than the Herman Miller Aeron Chair, coming in at around $850, but they are well worth the money and come with a full lifetime warranty.</p>
<p>Steel Case also makes a handful of other models that sport several other configurations to accomodate both your price range and feature set requirements. I would suggest checking out their company website to see what they have to offer. The Ultimate Back Store also carries Steel Case, and as the Herman Miller stuff, they regularly offer floor models for sale at heavy discounts. The best thing to do with UBS is call them and talk to a human being. They are great to deal with.</p>
<p>Steel Case is a great alternative to Herman Miller on many levels, especially price.</p>

<p>So, obviously there a hundred different ways to go with a task chair, and these are only two of my favorites. Of course your studio has certain requirements that we don&#8217;t have in Deane&#8217;s studio — every space is different. Maybe you turn to the side to play your keyboard controller or perhaps it is centered under your desk in front of you. Maybe you use an outboard mixing console, so you need to be able to &#8220;Alex Keaton&#8221; your way across the room and roll to where your outboard rig is set up.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, your chair is the epicenter of your whirlwind. It has to be great, not just <span style="font-style: italic;">good</span>. It will be the one piece of gear that sustains you over time and keeps you from pain.</p>
<p>Do your homework. Research the hell out of chairs. My next post will be about that fancy desk that Hans wants you to get!</p>

Regardless, I’d like to take some time focusing on the use of an analog synthesizer in your studio.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">“TOUCHABLE” SOUND</span></p>
<div class="MsoNormal">If most young composers are like me, they’ve spent the majority of their musical lives in the digital world, staring at a computer monitor and pushing virtual buttons and moving pixelated sliders to create music.  And while this is all fine and dandy, many young composers have little hands on experience with electronic instruments.  Even if they have, it’s usually with modern digital synthesizers consisting of nested menus, a few buttons, and a couple of knobs.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Some time ago a friend leant me an analog synthesizer- a monophonic one to be precise, a Korg MS-10.  This means I could play only one note at a time, which seemed quite absurd to me!  But this simplicity is what I needed to understand the basics of synthesis.  Every  parameter of sound was at my fingertips, from the oscillator to the filter to the VCA.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">And if the last sentence sounds like Greek, don’t worry (see the links to basic synthesis tutorials at the bottom of this post)- the fact is I had no idea what those things were when I started!  But all of those parameters of sound were assigned to a knob that I could <em>TOUCH!</em> Goodness gracious, I could actually move a big switch and make the sound change!  Maybe I am sounding like a huge dork, but this was a fantastic sensation to someone who had no prior experience with electronic music hardware other than a computer screen.  I could physically move a knob an inch or two and hear a dramatic change in sound</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Over the next several hours (and weeks and months…) to come I learned what all these parameters actually did to sound and began to understand how to actually make music (rather than bleeps and bloops) using analog synthesizers.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">All of this had a pleasant side effect- because I now that I understood how to control sound at this very basic level (using filters, envelopes, oscillators, etc.), I could apply this knowledge to my virtual instrument plug-ins, samples, and even to acoustic instruments.  I was now in control of the sound coming out of my studio far more so than if I had never touched an analog synthesizer.  My orchestral mockups were more convincing, my electronic sounds were more expressive, and I was able to make my loops sound unlike anyone else’s with a few minutes of extra programming.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">The funny thing is that even though I studied electronic music in college (several classes at a conservatory nonetheless!) it took an analog synthesizer from the 1970s for me to <em>finally</em> understand the basic physics of sound.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">THAT “ANALOG” SOUND</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">I’m going to stay away from the whole ‘analog’ vs. ‘digital’ debate and which sounds better.  We could argue until the cows come home.  But the fact remains- analog synthesizers create sounds using chips powered by electrical transformers.  That makes it different from the 0’s and 1’s of the digital world.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Anyone can operate in the digital world- I’ve heard convincing music created by novices in Garageband.  But in this new world of digital access (and excess…) where anyone with a computer can upload an original composition to iTunes, how can you separate yourself from the next composer?</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">If I had a master list of answers, I would be living in a large house on Venice beach and summering in the sound of France right now.  But what I can say is that it takes skill and talent to program analog synthesizers, and the depth they can add to a track is dramatic.  It can be another tool in your arsenal, contributing to the “je ne sais quoi” of originality.</div>

<div class="MsoNormal">In the next column I’ll highlight some specific techniques I’ve learned from analog synthesis as well as a slew of other mockup techniques to help your digital music sound more like performed music!</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="plus-one-wrap"><g:plusone size="medium" href="../../../2009/06/tame-template.html"></g:plusone></div><p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/sig-knaub.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-696" title="sig-knaub" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/sig-knaub.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>Every month I will be talking about the technology that we work with on a day to day basis as well as some tips on how to make your experience writing and composing music as easy as possible without letting the technology get in the way.</p>
<p>These techno toys we deal with can be very intimidating at times. Some of us are just not that technical and we don’t want to be, while others love combing through the manual and look forward to the challenges of taking on a new piece of gear. (In a future issue we will talk about GAS (Gear Acquisition Syndrome).</p>
<p>So what exactly do we have to deal with in our studios on a daily basis? Computers, mixing consoles, DAW controllers, audio interfaces, microphones, patch bays, word clock generators, stereo recorders, MIDI interfaces, MIDI sound modules, and not to mention all the different pieces of software you may use. And, let’s not forget our countless connections: Analog, Digital, MIDI, Ethernet, Video, Internet, etc. If you’re Deane, you probably have a fiber optic cable connected to your forehead as well.</p>
<p>When you sit down with pencil and paper, notation software, or your DAW, you want to turn on your right brain and go to it without thinking “is this hooked up correctly, how come I can’t hear the percussion tracks, and why are the lights dimming around my neighborhood.” (Unless, that is your mood lighting.)</p>
<p>Joe Trapanese mentions in his <a href="../../../2009/06/composer-as-producer-maximizing-your.html">column</a> that using templates is key to kicking your project off on the right foot. I have to agree that these are probably one of the most significant timesavers and methods to improve your creative muse.</p>
<p>So let’s talk specifically about the template in your sequencer or DAW. This template is really nothing more than a blank session that you have pre-configured to have all of your tracks/channels, routing, groupings, stems, and effects laid out in a way that makes your workflow smooth. Some composers use predominantly MIDI tracks and few audio tracks, while others use more audio tracks than MIDI. I have composer friends who may have separate tracks for every piece of the orchestra, percussion, and separate drum tracks. This can easily put you over 100 tracks. Do you need just a few key orchestral instruments? Are you composing with guitar and perhaps need 4-6 audio tracks as well? These are some of the questions to ask. How do I work best? What is the end result? A full mockup score to be redone later on during the scoring stage, or is this a lower budget piece that will use everything as played in your DAW. Whatever your result, start by adding these tracks to your blank template.</p>
<p>Before you do this, I recommend you sit down and spend a few hours or more laying out how you typically score and what are the technical logistics of your studio.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
Start with a list like this:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Small Orchestral Pop Template</span></p>
<p>* 5 external MIDI modules with stereo outputs using 2 MIDI channels on each module<br />
* One GigaSampler with 16 MIDI and16 digital audio outputs via ADAT<br />
* 10 internal Soft synths fed to outputs 1-4 on audio interface<br />
* 8 audio channels in DAW for loops, FX, etc.<br />
* All audio outputs run to external mixer<br />
* Mixer control levels and control room monitoring<br />
* Mixer feeds DAW inputs 1-2 for mixdown</p>
<p>A list similar to this can help you visualize exactly what you have and how things need to be connected and laid out in your DAW. Remember, the goal is to make things easy and simplistic.</p>
<p>From here, start to build out your template by adding tracks and testing them. Make sure your MIDI routing is correct and that you can hear the correct synths, soft synths, etc. If you are using a more complex setup, i.e. multiple computers and MIDI over LAN, these things take time to set up and trouble shoot if you encounter problems. So again, give yourself some time to be able to work out the kinks. You’re a composer – you don’t care that you may need an Ethernet crossover cable instead of a straight through, but your gear does.</p>
<p>Make sure to save your template after every modification.</p>
<p>If you’re using a soft sampler, make sure you have the instances loaded and a stereo or multiple output version configured. If you are pre-loading samples, then load them to their associated channels and test the MIDI and audio routing. (In a future issue we will talk about getting samplers to run outside of your DAW and the 32-bit memory limitation.)</p>
<p>If you are using any type of stems or sub groups, get those added in, and make sure your internal audio buses are working correctly. (Tip: Use a pre-recorded audio test tone on your tracks (audio) to test the audio outputs as well as aux and group busing.)</p>
<p>Add any internal or even external effects to your aux sends, individual tracks, groups, etc.</p>
<p>So we have our template saved with all of our tracks, groups, synths, samplers and effects. One last and very important thing we need to do is validate that your CPU is worthy of your template. One thing I like to do as a test is, using a stopwatch, time how long the template takes to open. If you have many soft samplers in your template and they are loading samples, this could take a while depending on your drive speed and whether you’re using RAID or not. This seems trivial but is actually quite useful if you know it takes 3 minutes to open, you could go get a cup of coffee or a glass of wine, while you’re waiting. This time is also important to know if you have to make any changes to the audio system settings. In Digital Performer for example, every time you open and close the audio driver settings, or change the buffer size, DP must reload the entire contents of the project, so count on another 3 minutes. This can definitely steal your Mojo. This I know first hand as I am currently in DP therapy for cursing at the computer screen during this time.</p>
<p>Record some MIDI and audio data to make sure the CPU can handle all you’ve just asked it to. You may have to change your buffer while recording and again during playback based on the speed of your system, at which point you can join me in therapy. :-)</p>
<p>So once we have our template finalized and working, we can now start writing that award winning Opus without the gear potentially getting in the way and blaming your soft synth for ruining your Oscar nomination.</p>
<p>Now some of you might be thinking about our good friend Murphy, and saying sometimes he likes to visit at the worst of times. Well, my fellow SCOREcasters, I can&#8217;t save you from Mr. Murphy, but I can tell you that by going through this exercise of building your template you’ll have a better understanding of how things are connected. You’ll have documentation and maybe even some type of drawing showing your connections. In the end, this should help you, if….. sorry I meant when you need to troubleshoot your studio setup.</p>
<p>Share with us tips on your templates.</p>
<p>Until next time, happy composing.</p>

As always, this provocation isn&#8217;t intended to be a statement of fact, or even to be taken literally… it&#8217;s simply a way to get a fresh perspective on the topic. To <span style="font-style: italic;">provoke</span>, in other words. And I <span style="font-style: italic;">c</span><span style="font-style: italic;">an&#8217;t wait</span> to hear what you think of this one.</p>
<div>P<strong>rovocation: Composers should have as little gear as possible.</strong></p>
<p>For any of us who have ever been bitten by the gear bug, this is straight-<span style="font-style: italic;">up heresy</span>! We <span style="font-style: italic;">need</span> that gear to be competitive. It provides us with inspiration, with new sonic possibilities. It&#8217;s an indispensable part of our work flow and our creative process. So the more the better… right?</p>
<p>On the other hand, having less gear might require us to use our creativity in a different way. Stripping down the studio might become its own sort of provocation—to delve a little deeper into the gear we <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> have.</p>
<p>For many years, my Kurzweil K2000 was at the heart of my studio, and I used it pretty much as a controller. Not much else; just a way to get notes on the screen. Which is kind of a shame, really. That synth had (and still has!) deep processing power that I&#8217;ll most likely never touch. Having less gear might oblige me to step outside my comfort zone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Less gear&#8221; could also be taken in a less literal sense—consider the balance between electronic and live sound sources in your scores. What if you had to use <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> live players for a project—could you do it? I&#8217;m guessing you could. What if you couldn&#8217;t even compose at the computer… what if you allowed yourself nothing but (the horror!) pencil and paper?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried it before—I spent several hours one sunny day on my balcony, armed only with a few score pages and a pencil. And a rapidly-shrinking eraser. It gave me a whole new appreciation for masters like Bernard Herrmann, who (so the legend goes) often wrote his sketches, <span style="font-style: italic;">in pen</span>, at the dinner table while surrounded by family.</p>
<p>How else could you read this provocation? Where does it take you? Hop on those comments, people, and make some noise.</p>

Years ago I worked on monstrous analog synthesizers &#8211; and like everyone else I&#8217;ve seen them shrink to computer-screen-sized virtual emulations. Just a few weeks ago I was touring a major scoring stage in town. They showed me the blank wall plate and large empty floor space in the control room where the multi-track recording units at one time dominated of the room. It was odd to see the outline of that portion of the floor where the big heavy recorders used to sit &#8211; it resembled a photo negative of a chalk outline for a dead (rectangular) body.</p>
<p>Like so many others, I went from a room full of synthesizers, effects and recording gear to a single keyboard-based workstation with built-in sequencer and effects. I held out through the transition from analog to digital tape (at least in my own studio) and moved directly to computer-based recording. At that point, I was as eager as anyone to put everything &#8220;in the box&#8221;. It seemed like desktop computing and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore&#8217;s Law</a> was going to completely subsume the inherent limitations of hardware-specific processing. Of course there have been exceptions, from the continued development of dedicated hardware by a diminishing number of manufacturers &#8211; to the DSP-based add-on cards that support recording, effects and synthesis with the computer as the front-end. But, regardless of those stalwarts, the march toward software-based *everything* seemed inevitable.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s hasn&#8217;t been all paradise in the land of the desktop. There are the always-looming hardware and software incompatibilities, not to mention the nearly-constant quest from more processing power. So many times those two factors are in a tug-of-war with each other &#8211; particularly with the current fits and starts toward native 64-bit computing. And from the manufacturers&#8217; perspectives, piracy has played a large part in their reticence to embrace the paradigm shift. In the midst of those contending factors there has been an interesting convergence &#8211; hardware seems to be making a kind of comeback. (and some would say *another* comeback) As it turns out, Moore&#8217;s Law is a rising tide that lifts all ships &#8211; including specialized DSP processors. It has made it possible to put more power into specialized processors, and that in turn has allowed some hardware manufacturers to stake out new territory in the changing studio landscape. And several of those hardware-centric companies have been putting some effort into integrating their products into the computer-centered studio.</p>
<p>For me, the migration back to hardware was nearly accidental. It started with my work on a new synthesizer from a company that started out as a plug-in designer. I helped to write the owner&#8217;s manual for that synth, and between the massive amount of DSP power and front panel control plus the greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts architecture, I had to make it a permanent part of my studio. The next step on the slippery slope toward next-generation hardware was the change to a new audio interface on my main audio workstation. The device has a surprising amount of dedicated DSP on-board which can be used as a fully integrated plug-in in my sequencing environment. This one factor has caused me to go back and re-configure my scoring template &#8211; the built-in reverb on the audio interface is *that* good. And now I&#8217;m waiting on delivery of a new synthesizer that seamlessly integrates with the audio interface and sequencing environment to the point that it has all of the look and feel of a software-based plug-in. The beauty of it is that the one-hundred-plus voices and myriad effects are generated from a single-space rack mounted unit.</p>
<p>It truly is the best of both worlds &#8211; but the irony is not lost on me. Even for orchestra-heavy cues, a substantial portion (and sometimes an outright majority) of sound in my studio is once again being generated by dedicated outboard hardware. Since I have found myself back in this position nearly by accident, it makes me wonder how and if other composers are re-discovering the potential advantage of dedicated hardware in their studio.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="plus-one-wrap"><g:plusone size="medium" href="../../../2009/06/composer-as-producer-maximizing-your.html"></g:plusone></div><p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/sig-trapanese.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-766" title="sig-trapanese" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/sig-trapanese.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>So here I am, responsible for getting these columns off to a delinquent start!  But, I have a legitimate excuse, which I am going to use to kick off my first post here in my series “Composer as Producer.”</p>
<p>Before I get started, I’ll take a quick moment to explain the purpose of my column.  As a lecturer at UCLA, my personal goal is to train students in the skills they need to bring their music from the initial moment of creativity to the finished product, whether it be a live performance, an electronic recording, or a combination of the two.</p>
<p>Even as the prices of music production equipment continue to fall, and the opportunities for live performances and funding continue to disappear, most schools continue to train composers in the same ways they have for years, falling short of giving composer the essential tools to actually deliver their music to an audience.  The purpose of this column is to help fill in the gap between traditional music training (creativity and technique) and the elusive process of creating a tangible musical product that can be sold, broadcasted, and promoted (making a living).</p>
<p>So back to my excuse and the impetus for this first column.  Yesterday I was called to orchestrate and conduct a short recording session that had an 11am downbeat… today. Without the techniques I speak about below, the answer could not have been ‘Yes.’</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">TEMPLATES</span></p>
<div class="MsoNormal">Templates are a key to beginning your projects off on the right foot.  When orchestrating and preparing parts, use a Sibelius or Finale template with objects that are unique to film music already set- boxed bar numbers in the correct places; both violin lines in the same part; a line dedicated to notating pre-recorded material; correct spacing, etc.  Objects which may not appear in an ideal place when starting from scratch (copyright text, composer text, page numbers, et al.) should be moved to the correct position in both the score and parts.  Formatting the parts in this template (spacing, bar number location, placement of text) is key. Furthermore, upon starting a new project, copy and modify the basic template to fit the unique instrumentation as well as any special needs of the particular session and its musicians.  A reasonable estimate of time save is about 20-40 minutes of detailed editing saved <em>per score</em>.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Perhaps even more useful are templates in sequencing programs.  When using external computers hosting sounds, this standard technique saves us from setting complex MIDI and audio routings within each new session (sometimes for over 150 tracks in modern film composer studios).  But there are a handful of other ways to save yourself time and effort when beginning a sequence and setting up your tracks.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">For Logic users, an entire chain of plugins can be saved as a ‘Channel Strip,’ a small file which preserves the settings of every single plugin loaded on a channel, from samplers to compressors to reverbs.  This feature is accessed above the EQ window on any channel in the Logic mixer.  Once you have created a useful sound that you will want to recall elsewhere in your project or at any point in the future.  These files can then be copied to other computers (Users / Home Folder / Library / Application Support / Logic / Channel Strip Settings) and as of Logic 8, can be shared using Apple’s Me service.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Unique to Digital Performer are V-Racks, short for “Virtual Racks.”  Several plugins can be put into a V-Rack and saved.  These virtual racks are maintained when switching sequences in Digital Performer’s chunks feature, saving what can be upwards of 5 minutes in plugin and sample loading time when switching cues.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Digital Performer, Cubase, and ProTools can also save settings using the plugin’s dedicated save features or the host application’s own plugin saving function.  However, large and complex plugins may not be able to save in the host application’s own plugin interface.  These files may be limited in size and unable to save each parameter or these extensive plugins (this is currently and issue with Digital Performer and Omnisphere; use Omisphere’s own save function to overcome this).</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">These programs allow you to save templates within their own interface, and Logic 8 and Pro Tools 8 both come with pre-made templates including plugins set up by professional engineers.  Plugins such as Kontakt and Stylus RMX allow the saving of multiple channels of instruments and their settings into a single ‘Multi’ file.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style: italic;">ADVANCED TRICK: Do you like the idea or channel strips but you don’t use Logic?  Try Plogue Bidule.  Known as an efficient and stable AU and VST host that can run in both standalone and Rewire, Plogue Bidule comes in a plugin form as well.  Inserted as a virtual instrument in your sequencer, you can create a chain of effects and plugins within the interface of the plugin and save this setting for future use.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><em><br />
</em></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">KEY COMMANDS</span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">The more time your hand spends moving a mouse around the more time you are going to spend focusing on the screen, navigating through deep menus, and in general, being distracted from writing.  Rather than searching for a task that is located 3 menus deep within a certain editor window, most tasks have been assigned a key or set of keys on the QWERTY keyboard that take a fraction of the second to complete</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Tasks that have not been assigned key commands can be created by the use in programs such as Logic and Digital Performer, while the initial set can also be edited to taste.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">The goal any composer has is to write good music with minimal distraction and strain.  Being able to quickly make changes to the material in your sequencer, notation editor, or any other computer program will help break down the ‘virtual wall’ between your creativity and the execution of it using a digital medium.  Learn how to minimize your time on the mouse by with key commands- learn them as you go along, and the more you work, key commands will gradually become part of your process.  I don&#8217;t even think about key commands anymore- they have become second nature.  The result is a fluid interface between creativity and the programs used to solidify it.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style: italic;">ALSO: For Logic users, a key command that is often overlooked is ‘Capture Last Take as Recording.”  As your are playing your sequence, the computer is listening to and remember every note you play between the time you hit play and the time you hit stop.  Using this key command can take that improvisation that turned out to be quite good into an midi region- exactly how you played it!  I never hit record any more…</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><em><br />
</em></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">FILE ORGANIZATION</span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Keeping files organized and safe on your computer will be the last topic of today’s post.  This seemingly boring issue will not seem so boring the day your hard drive fails; or after you waste several hours trying to figure out which file is the one the studio loved; or rewriting a main title cue after accidentally erasing the original.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">First things first- create a single master folder for the project where every file associated with the project will live.  Subfolders can be made within that- Sequences, Rough Mixes, Documents, Videos, etc.  Back up this folder using one of any number of fine products &#8211; SuperDuper, CarbonCopyCloner, SynchronizeX, Time Machine, Retrospect.  In fact, if the project is currently underway, back it up to two places.  And update the backups twice per day at least!</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">This system also makes transferring the entire project between systems very simple.  When moving between your desktop and laptop, rather than gathering files together from all across your system, you can just copy the master folder over to your laptop drive get started.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">One common file organization technique is to use a 2 to 3 letter abbreviation for a project at the beginning of each file associated with it.  For instance, if I was scoring a show named ‘Donald the Duck,’ each sequence, audio mix, or document associated with the show would begin with the abbreviation ‘DD.’  Also, rather than using spaces, which may cause errors on PCs as well as when exchanging files on the internet, many will use underscores instead of spaces.  So if I wrote a cue called ‘River Chase’ for this show, my file would be called ‘DD_1m1_RiverChase.’</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">After that name, a version number will be placed so that changes can be tracked easily.  Say I have written ‘DD_1m1_RiverChase_v1’ and the producer has requested some revisions.  Rather than going into version 1 and editing that, I will duplicate the file and rename it ‘DD_1m1_RiverChase_v2,’ preserving my original version in case it is needed later in the process.  Depending on the process, even a sub-version may be used for smaller changes, i.e. ‘DD_1m1_RiverChase_v2-1’ or ‘DD_1m1_RiverChase_v2b.’</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Timecode can be placed in filenames as well.  Rather than using colons or periods usually associated with timecode, dashes will translate much better when passing files to different people and systems.  Usually the hour is dropped because this is indicated by the first digit of the cue number (‘1m1’ in the title above would translate to ‘Hour 1, Music Cue 1.’  Similarly, music cue 2 in hour 3 will be designated ‘3m2.’)</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Perhaps the final mix file of this cue will look like this: ‘DD_1m1_RiverChase_v3_03-31-15.’  That timecode at the end would translate to 3 minutes, 31 seconds, and 15 frames.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Dates can also be used.  To differentiate between dates and timecode, most often the punctuation of dates is removed so that today, June 1<sup>st</sup> 2009 would become 060109.</div>

Much music made this way is accepted by listeners, and for some, no doubt, even preferred.  At the other end of the spectrum, a lot of music is still created the good old-fashioned way &#8212; by flesh-and-blood musicians who play our scores.  In the middle, all sorts of hybrids are possible.</p>
<p>It would be of great interest (well, to me, at least) to know more about the <span style="font-style: italic;">actual </span>proportion of music which, in its <span style="font-style: italic;">final </span>form (e.g., in a film soundtrack) is currently being played by &#8220;virtual musicians&#8221; vs. real musicians.</p>
<p>Another facet of this issue:  Is the public&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">expectation </span>for media score shifting in the direction of virtual music?  If so, are we eroding an appreciation for the incredible accomplishments of many great composers (think Wagner, Stravinsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Copland, Holmboe, and on and on) who, without a computer, effects rack, or whatever, created music that could readily be fantastic score even in today&#8217;s films?  Does it matter?</p>
<p>Is constant pressure to produce on short schedules forcing increased use of virtual music technology?  Does this approach actually save time (or money)?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to suggest that using technology to produce music isn&#8217;t a true art in and of itself.  I&#8217;ve long been a virtual music proponent, but traditional practice is becoming of increasing interest to me.</p>
<p>Please share your impressions and actual experience.  I&#8217;d bet a <span style="font-style: italic;">lot</span> of us have something to say on this topic &#8211; and it affects how we approach our craft, as well.</p>

In another post by Brian Satterwhite on his blog, he talks about <a href="http://www.briansatterwhite.com/blog/index.php?/archives/1201-A-Very-Productive-Week.html" target="_new">buying a violin bow and just bowing everything</a> to see how it sounds.</p>
