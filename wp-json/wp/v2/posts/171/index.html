We all know how tough it can be sometimes to make enough money from composing &#8211; in particular when starting off. Some of us have a part time job while starting off, some have a full time job &#8211; others have no side jobs &#8211; just composing.<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230; how can we make more money from our music, even after it has been used for its original purpose of a film score, etc.? We sometimes forget that the money making process doesn&#8217;t always have to stop there &#8211; we can keep licensing our music (depending on the original license we signed with the director\/creator) after the original project. It&#8217;s not all about the money, but let&#8217;s not fool ourselves &#8211; we all need money to survive, and the more the merrier. \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>I currently sell some of my music on stock music libraries and make between $200-$350 per month &#8211; which is nice pocket money for paying the bills, or buying whatever. However, that money is generally only 50% or less, of the net profit that my music makes &#8211; the websites I sell on can take from 50% &#8211; 75% of the money my music earns, which can often be quite disheartening.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, I looked into ways to make 100% profit on selling my music &#8211; then it hit me &#8211; I sell a collection of about 12 piano tracks on a website about 4 or 5 times a month, and it sells for $100 a pop (of which I earn 50%). So&#8230;if I could sell a CD for $100, why not sell it on my own website for $100 for licensing purposes or $20 for personal listening, and earn all of the profit? So I contacted some CD duplication companies to see how much it would cost to get 50 CDs created, and started looking at the sums:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Expenditure:<\/span><br \/>\n<a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/6\/6f\/Crystal_Clear_app_kspread.png\"><img style=\"cursor: pointer; float: right; height: 128px; margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; width: 128px;\" src=\"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/6\/6f\/Crystal_Clear_app_kspread.png\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>50 CDs = $283 (CDs include colour artwork printed on CD, jewelcases, album cover and back)<br \/>\nDelivery = $24<br \/>\n__________<br \/>\nTotal = $307<\/p>\n<p>If we then take a look at the total possible income, the money starts to add up nicely. Lets say I sell 30 CDs for personal listening (I&#8217;m sure I could find enough friends and family to buy them! LOL) and then 20 CDs for licensing purposes.<\/p>\n<p>30 x $20 = $600<br \/>\n20 x $100 = $2000<br \/>\n_____________<br \/>\nNet Total = $2600<br \/>\n______________________________<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Gross Total Possible Income<\/span>= <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">$2293<\/span><br \/>\n_____________________________<\/p>\n<p>OK &#8211; so the above sums <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">may <\/span>be wishful thinking, but it certainly looks like it could be a profitable venture, so why not try? My CDs are being made this week and should be ready in a few days time. I&#8217;ll share my progress with you as I go &#8211; I think it will be a worthwhile experiment.<\/p>\n<p>The next questions is &#8211; how do I sell them\/market them? That&#8217;s where things get interesting&#8230; I want to make 100% of the profit so I won&#8217;t be using services such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdbaby.com\/\">CD Baby<\/a> to sell my CDs for me &#8211; at least for now. I&#8217;ll be trying a few different marketing ideas and I&#8217;ll let you know which work, and which don&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>In Part 2 of this article (coming soon), I&#8217;ll show you how to license music on your website, rather than relying on other sites to do it for you.<\/p>\n<p>Have <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">you <\/span>looked into CD Duplication services in your area, and have you tried selling CDs of your music? How do they stack up against services like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.discmakers.com\/\">DiscMakers<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oasiscd.com%2F&amp;ei=7ercSoqQC4eKswPswqCsDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHywmE0v-Idhc0i-3fI5okm7jkmRA&amp;sig2=NgunpYCKI2q-slGmOw_JOQ\">Oasis<\/a>?
