Here's what I want you to be thinking about this weekend:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eWho is your competition?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca name\u003d'more'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt's counter-intuitive, but in a way you face greater competition if you're just starting out than if you're somewhat established. Composers have become like lawyers… with more aspirants in training than practitioners making a living in the field. There are more composers on the D-list than the C-list; more on the C-list than the B-list, and so on. So the number of people targeting that $5,000 indie film is actually greater than the number gunning for the $200 million blockbuster. The major pictures are, of course, a much higher-stakes game, but the players at the table are fewer… especially considering that many of the filmmakers who work at that level already have their composer. C'mon, did you really think anyone but James Horner was gonna score \u003ci\u003eAvatar\u003c/i\u003e?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTaking a look at your \"level\" of gig—and don't get me wrong; I think going for projects that are a \u003ci\u003elittle\u003c/i\u003e over your head can be a good thing, if you approach it as a learning experience and a way to force yourself to stretch!—you can quickly assess the level of craftsmanship, experience, studio resources, etc. that you're likely to be facing in the competition. You can find out, in other words, who the competition really \u003ci\u003eis\u003c/i\u003e. That's something you need to know.\u003cbr /\u003eUse Google, social media of all sorts (searching Twitter is a great way to make some progress here)—seek out a couple dozen of your peers, whether you've ever made their acquaintance or not, and take stock. Figure out who the competition really is for the kinds of gigs you're trying to get. Hell, hit up IMDb and find out who got the gigs you didn't… if you're targeting your own demos appropriately, that alone should give you a pretty good view of the terrain.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOnce you've determined that you're safe (for now) from having to compete with the Williamses and the Elfmen of the world, I recommend doing some \u003cb\u003eopposition research\u003c/b\u003e. We all put our cues on websites to be listened to; it's fair game for you to go and listen.\u0026nbsp;Compare your stuff with the competition.\u003cb\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003ePart One\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eof this technique is to play a couple of cues from several people who are at your level… then play a couple of your own cues. A-B. Back and forth. Be critical: Are you doing as well or better in terms of finished musical product? Chances are you're at least close. Congratulations. But don't get too cocky. Focus on the stuff others are doing better.\u003cb\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003ePart Two\u003c/b\u003e of this strategy is more painful, more humbling, but crucial. Play your stuff, A-B, with the composers at the top of the food chain. Producers don't care that you don't have rooms and rooms full of gear, with small armies of studio underlings, to make everything sparkle. They just want their score to KILL. So A-B yourself with the people you think are absolutely the best in terms of writing chops, production quality, dramatic sensitivity. And draw the appropriate conclusions about where you stand. You might even try specifically writing a few cues for your demo as \"\u003ci\u003ex\u003c/i\u003e-killers\" (where \u003ci\u003ex\u003c/i\u003e is one of your favorite film-score cues by a composer other than yourself). See if you can out-do your heroes. Benefit from the fact that they've already done a lot of the hard work by defining the parameters of the cue. Just be sure to do it in a way that conveys your personality. Filmmakers can smell a Thomas Newman-alike or a John Williams-alike a mile off, and they'll wonder if you have anything original to contribute to their project.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut creating amazing music, as we always emphasize around here, is only a part of the equation. You might do well to re-evaluate yourself as a competitor (my \u003ca href\u003d\"../../../../../2009/06/phases-of-game.html\"\u003eblog entry\u003c/a\u003e on this subject is still available, and this might be a good time to take the quiz, if you haven't already).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eEvaluate the competition, too—see what you like about their websites… their online personalities… the way they're leveraging social media. Then simply do what it takes to make your situation better. Use your own taste and your own resources as a guide.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eDefining exactly who your competition is (by how far along you are, what your network of Industry contacts looks like, etc.) allows you to keep one eye on the fellow members of whatever list you honestly think you're on… and it allows you to keep the other eye on the folks at the top of the heap. Two points… that define the line of your own upward progression in this career.\u003cdiv class\u003d\"blogger-post-footer\"\u003e\u003cimg width\u003d'1' height\u003d'1' src\u003d'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2957472132698657339-5787380124065652082?l\u003dwww.scorecastonline.com' alt\u003d'' /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"},"link":[{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2957472132698657339/posts/default/5787380124065652082"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2957472132698657339/posts/default/5787380124065652082"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"../../../../../2010/02/weekend-provocation-whos-competition.html","title":"Weekend Provocation: Who's the Competition?"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Lee Sanders"},"uri":{"$t":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/08035088236361437862"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$extendedProperty":{"xmlns$gd":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005","name":"OpenSocialUserId","value":"15436834845629676295"}}],"media$thumbnail":{"xmlns$media":"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/","url":"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hCspY__CLOo/S2jihWwJ_TI/AAAAAAAAAJM/TWIelOS2Be8/s72-c/sanders-provocation-1.png","height":"72","width":"72"}},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2957472132698657339.post-3958365371565697684"},"published":{"$t":"2010-01-06T21:15:00.000-08:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2010-01-06T21:15:57.848-08:00"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"gigs"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"monthly themes"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"getting hired"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"research"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"getting the gig"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"polls"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"POLL: Getting the Gig"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003ca href\u003d\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/S0VtpckwL9I/AAAAAAAAAz0/Eoxyd1dwxAE/s1600-h/logo_website_136px.jpg\" imageanchor\u003d\"1\" style\u003d\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"\u003e\u003cimg border\u003d\"0\" src\u003d\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/S0VtpckwL9I/AAAAAAAAAz0/Eoxyd1dwxAE/s1600/logo_website_136px.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003eWake up, shower, coffee, power up, check your vitals, relisten to last night's unfinished cue, try to get back into it, struggle, struggle some more, finally break through, smile, remember to eat something (maybe!), stretch, deal with some phone calls, write some more, \"Oh my God, it's midnight already!\", fix that thing in your template that's been bugging you, work some more, give up, go to bed, sleep for three hours, do it all again. \u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eSound familiar?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca name\u003d'more'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWith the myriad things going on in your studio, when would you ever have time to network, email, stay in touch, and just generally mine for other gigs?

It's a tough thing to talk about for me because my creative process (CP) is in such a constant state of flux all of the time. From project to project, my CP changes up drastically. And then sometimes, what worked on one project also works great on the next.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhat I will offer today is a sneak peek into the creative habits of some of the composers that I've worked with over the few years that I've been assisting. From these great composers, I've gleaned many secrets, tricks, templates, skills, and techniques - some that I use in my own work, and others that I don't, but might someday. The thing that I've always noticed about each composer though, no matter who they were or what they were working on, is that these tricks and secrets were really \"habitual\" in their work flows. These are things that they do EVERY time they sit down to conceptualize or write through a film score. And I believe that is the key to the whole thing. You need to develop \"habits\" that will invite the Muse to the right time and place for a creative collision.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSince these are from different composers, I will present some here in no particular order. Hopefully, you'll find one or two of these habits (or all of them if you are just getting going) useful.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eThe Overture Blueprint\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSeveral composers I've worked for use this principle as an overarching guide to how they score a film. They'll watch the film many times (and I mean MANY times; sometimes in upwards of thirty of forty viewings), and then they'll sit down at the piano or guitar and write an \"overture\".\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn traditional terms, an overture is a piece of music that \"comes before\" or \"precedes\" something else. A typical example would be the music the symphony plays before the opera starts. But inherent in almost every overture are the main themes of the opera or of the piece that follows the overture. The overture is sort of a large format rendering of every main theme within the whole work and addresses each theme with as much fullness and bravado that can be pulled from it - a fully fleshed out thematic linear string. Each theme and motif is represented in the overture. Upon completing the overture, the composer then has a veritable blueprint from which he or she can create the score and work the cues around in order to not stray far from the original thoughts behind the music.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMany composers use or have used this method, from \u003ca class\u003d\"zem_slink\" href\u003d\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000025/\" rel\u003d\"imdb\" title\u003d\"Jerry Goldsmith\"\u003eJerry Goldsmith\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca class\u003d\"zem_slink\" href\u003d\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0653211/\" rel\u003d\"imdb\" title\u003d\"John Ottman\"\u003eJohn Ottman\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eResearch and Ethnomusicology\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhen I was at Media Ventures, I watched Hans and crew research the hell out of most films they were charged with scoring. In fact, much of the first weeks were consumed with me and my fellow interns fetching books and Web clippings about certain instruments, even to the point of sussing out the foremost experts in the fields of these instruments and asking them questions, or sometimes inviting them to play on scores. These exercises in research gave me an awareness of the breadth of our musical vocabulary that I never learned in school or in private study. Once you really dive into the process of researching, from an ethnomusicological standpoint, you will understand just how much you have to learn about global musics. Talking to those who play these instruments will also teach you how to better write for that sound, and as a composer who most likely doesn't play that particular instrument, this is vital to the quality of your music.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eTemplates and Maps\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOne of the things I never can stomach in certain scores is when you are watching along and are really into the film, and then POW! Out of nowhere, a sound so AGAINST anything else in the film score whomps you upside your head, taking you out of the film completely. More often that not, you hear this on smaller, lower-budget films. And I'll tell you why.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNot always, but typically, the lower the budget the less experienced the composer and director. The above problem is usually two-fold. First, the director let that choice go unchallenged, or in some cases came up with the idea himself! Secondly, the composer was working without a \"template\".\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eA template can be defined here as a \"DAW instrumentation map for the duration of a film score\". Essentially, you take your arrange window in your DAW and load up every articulation of every instrument that you deem necessary for the film's score... and you DON'T DEVIATE from that template as you write your cues. This way, the entire score, from beginning to end, is cohesive and complimentary of its parts.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs I mentioned before, nine times out of ten, this is a rookie mistake. Most seasoned pros have already learned from the consequences of this error. When a score travels outside the lines of its own conceptualization, it causes severe cinematic problems. Take some time and be thorough in setting up your templates. If you practice the method of the \"Overture Blueprint\", as outlined above, you might already have the makings of your full template by the time you are finished with the overture.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eSound Mining, the \"Favorite Bank\", and Go-To Sounds\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf I had a nickel for every time I've seen composers sit at their desk and scroll through plugin presets with one hand while eating a carton of Chinese food with the other, I'd be a very rich man. The best composers I've worked with are those who know their rigs inside and out, and the only way to know what you have sitting on those precious drives is to \"mine for sounds\" as much as possible. One of my duties as an assistant has been to set up a \"favorite bank\" for my composer so that when he or she finds a killer sound that catches the ear, we can throw it into the bank and recall it later when we are looking for something interesting in a particular situation.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTime is precious. There is often no time on a film score schedule to sit and try to \"find\" the right synth patch or MIDI drum sound. You have to have it at your fingertips, or your creative flow will eventually slow to a stop. Make sure to have all of your \"favorite\" sounds readily accessible so that you can recall them at will when you need them the most.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis also goes for \"go-to sounds\" — those sounds that you use all of the time. These may already be in your template, but if they aren't, you should have them in their own sampler bank so that you can get at them instantly. These days, with Kontakt 4 and Machfive being as powerful as they have become, you can pull virtually any sound into your sampler in most formats. There is no reason to not have everything loaded into your sampler in a \"favorite bank\" or \"go-to bank\". Just do it.
