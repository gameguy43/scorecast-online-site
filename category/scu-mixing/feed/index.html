				<description><![CDATA[After a brief introduction to mixing, Jorge Costa dedicates this and the next articles to dynamic controllers with central focus on compressors, how they operate and how to use them.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Origins</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>this could take several articles, but let’s get slim on the facts and skip but the relevant ones, to avoid you catching some z’s while trying to read this</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Compressors appear in radio from the necessity to solve the problem of sound sources of different levels, preventing the transmitters overload and blow. Before that, the only solution was the radio engineer riding the fader down on loud parts and push it up on soft ones. As you may guess, unless those guys were fast as “<em>Lucky Luke</em>” their success was nothing but short. They need a device that had a peak control to protect the transmitter, (<em>AM at the time</em>) while balancing different material to be broadcast at consistent levels. Those have been called at the time, leveling amplifiers or limiters, but act pretty much like our days compressors. True limiting took “<em>some</em>” years to became as we know it today, with the help of better technology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first dynamic compressor made it’s appearance on the public address system at the 1936 Olympics, it was a <em>Telefunken</em> U3.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Studio engineers also adopt compressors to help them in the gain riding of live performances, to avoid distortion when they cut to disk, prevent tapes from over saturation and in digital to get rid of clipping.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over the years these outboard units improved greatly and still are in use today (<em>for those who can afford the luxury of having vintage compressors racks</em>) from top studios, producers and mastering facilities. Later some mixing consoles manufacturers incorporate compressors in they channel strip desks. Today, in our DAWs, we abuse the use of plug-ins and in this particular case compressors as <em>Seinfeld</em> says <em>because we can</em> !!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do we know how to set it correctly or do we slap it on track and go wow cool, it’s loud now.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s find out, first will have a look at the some of the ways used to get compression.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="../../../2012/11/29/dynamic-controllers-origins-brief-history-and-compressor-controls/dynamic-new-graphs-01" rel="attachment wp-att-1940"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1940" title="Dynamic New graphs 01" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamic-New-graphs-01.png" alt="" width="614" height="461" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamic-New-graphs-01.png 1024w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamic-New-graphs-01-160x120.png 160w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamic-New-graphs-01-389x291.png 389w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamic-New-graphs-01-640x480.png 640w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamic-New-graphs-01-300x224.png 300w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamic-New-graphs-01-260x194.png 260w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /></a></p>
<h2>Dynamic controllers</h2>
<h3>Dynamic controllers modify the dynamic range of a signal</h3>
<p><a href="../../../2012/11/29/dynamic-controllers-origins-brief-history-and-compressor-controls/dynamic-new-graphs-02" rel="attachment wp-att-1941"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1941" title="Dynamic New graphs 02" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamic-New-graphs-02.png" alt="" width="614" height="461" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamic-New-graphs-02.png 1024w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamic-New-graphs-02-160x120.png 160w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamic-New-graphs-02-389x291.png 389w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamic-New-graphs-02-640x480.png 640w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamic-New-graphs-02-300x224.png 300w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamic-New-graphs-02-260x194.png 260w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /></a></p>
<h2>Dynamic Controllers Graphics</h2>
<p><a href="../../../2012/11/29/dynamic-controllers-origins-brief-history-and-compressor-controls/dynamic-new-graphs-03" rel="attachment wp-att-1942"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1942" title="Dynamic New graphs 03" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamic-New-graphs-03.png" alt="" width="614" height="461" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamic-New-graphs-03.png 1024w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamic-New-graphs-03-160x120.png 160w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamic-New-graphs-03-389x291.png 389w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamic-New-graphs-03-640x480.png 640w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamic-New-graphs-03-300x224.png 300w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamic-New-graphs-03-260x194.png 260w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /></a></p>
<h2>Compression</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Compressors reduces the dynamic range of a signal, boosting the quieter signals and attenuating the louder ones, making the difference between loudest and softest sounds shorter by “<em>squashing</em>” it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Threshold</strong>: this setting dictates (<em>generally in dB</em>) the level at the compressor kicks in, how loud the signal as to be before gain reduction begins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Low values will compress most of the signal, with higher values only the peaks (<em>highest levels of the signal</em>) will be compressed letting signals below the threshold unaffected (<em>with hard knee</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>There are some compressors that don&#8217;t have a dedicated threshold control /slider, these are fixed threshold units. In this case it&#8217;s the input knob that rules, the higher the input the more it overshoots the fixed threshold</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>0 dB (calibrated mark) is the highest signal level you can reach in digital before clipping, a threshold setting of &#8211; 8 dB tells the compressor to kick in 8 dB bellow 0 dB</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ratio</strong>: controls the amount of compression applied between input and output signals above the threshold.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A 1:1 ratio means no compression is applied, but a 2:1 ratio means that any input signal that overshoots the threshold say 6 dB will leave the compressor with a 3 dB reduction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">( &#8211;<em> 6 dB threshold, ratio 2:1, signal leaves at &#8211; 9dB a 3 dB reduction above threshold</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most compressors ranging from 2:1 to 20:1, at this ratio, is considered a <strong>Limiter</strong> (<em>actually since a 10:1 ratio is <strong>Limiting</strong></em>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Attack</strong>: controls the time the compressor takes to react to signals above the threshold (<em>in milliseconds</em>). With (<em>lower value numbers</em>) fast attack times, the signal will be attenuated almost immediately. With medium to fast attack times, it lets the initial peaks pass before the compressor kicks in (<em>this can add a punchier sound with percussive effect</em>). With a slower attack, it lets a sustained note passing thru before the compressor reacts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Release</strong>: controls the time the compressor takes to react to signals bellow the threshold and stop compressing (<em>also in milliseconds</em>). The lower the number, the faster the release time. With very fast release times the compressor stops working immediately as soon it falls bellow the threshold (<em>in most cases, this can sound unnatural</em>). With too slow release times, the compressor may attenuate a soft passage followed by a loud one, simply because the unit had no time to recover.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>some compressors have switchable <strong>auto attack</strong> or <strong>auto release</strong> buttons, when those are engaged the fixed values stop being constant and will change automatically according to the level of the input signal</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hard or Soft knee</strong>: Some compressors have the option between hard or soft knee. With hard knee the compression kicks instantly when the threshold overshoots. With soft knee, compression is obtained gradually (<em>curve shape rather than hard angled</em>) on both sides of the threshold, thus more gently and more transparent, hard knee has more compression effect.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"> Hard knee  and  Soft knee</h2>
<p><a href="../../../2012/11/29/dynamic-controllers-origins-brief-history-and-compressor-controls/hard-knee-4" rel="attachment wp-att-1934"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1934" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Hard-Knee3.png" alt="" width="137" height="123" /></a> <a href="../../../2012/11/29/dynamic-controllers-origins-brief-history-and-compressor-controls/soft-knee-2" rel="attachment wp-att-1935"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1935" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Soft-knee1.png" alt="" width="136" height="124" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Make-up gain</strong>: automatic compensates the gain loss in compression relative to the threshold, ratio and attack settings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Gain reduction meter</strong>: displays the amount of compression applied to the signal (<em>in dB</em>). Showing when gain reduction occurs, when it starts and when it stops, a good visual indicator to better adjust helper for attack and release settings. Some compressors have <em>LED</em> bargraph others have <em>needle</em> type meters. Bargraph is quicker to respond, thus more accurate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Output</strong>: self explanatory, allows you to attenuate or boost the compressor output signal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Side chain</strong>: allows the amount of compression be triggered by an external signal fed via an auxiliary output to the unit side chain input. For example to reduce sibilance (<em>in conjunction with EQ</em>) and duking, to name but two.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stereo linking switch</strong>: a stereo compressor is basically a unit with two mono compressors working independently (<em>dual mono mode</em>). This switch allows both compressors to work as two identical ones preventing image shifting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today we have the fortune to incorporate most of hardware compression units emulated in our Daws like this Logic plugin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="../../../2012/11/29/dynamic-controllers-origins-brief-history-and-compressor-controls/dynamics-new-graph-04" rel="attachment wp-att-1943"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1943" title="Dynamics New graph 04" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamics-New-graph-04.png" alt="" width="614" height="461" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamics-New-graph-04.png 1024w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamics-New-graph-04-160x120.png 160w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamics-New-graph-04-389x291.png 389w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamics-New-graph-04-640x480.png 640w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamics-New-graph-04-300x224.png 300w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dynamics-New-graph-04-260x194.png 260w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /></a></p>
<p>With third party top plugins those emulations are becoming even better with every new version. Like Waves, Universal Audio, Sonnox, to name just a few excellent ones.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Presonus Studio One power-user Nikola Jeremic presents the features that make Studio One a highly versatile and essential tool in any modern composer's arsenal. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify">Choosing a DAW is like choosing a new car for you, and each of us has our own personal taste to satisfy. I know how hard it is to start learning things from scratch, and that’s the reason why many composers out there are reluctant to take a new step forward. First time I met Studio One was at a friend’s studio, and, of course, I was rather unwilling, maybe even scared, to work on it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I have to admit that I was soooooo wrong at first!  First look at Studio One’s interface got me hooked immediately. Sure, maybe it looks a bit sterile because it’s all gray-ish, but I like simplicity. I don’t like millions of colors jumping all over the screen, it just gets me distracted. The second thing that I like about it is that every project that I bounce sounds exactly the way I intended it to sound. In this first part, I will show you some of its features and make a comparison with other major DAWs on the market.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify" align="center"><strong><em>The Birth of Studio One</em></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">How did Studio One come to life? There’s a little company in Baton Rouge, Louisiana called PreSonus, and they’ve been around for years making very affordable and high quality audio hardware.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Only recently they have started making DAW software, and they’ve made a smart move to hire ex-employees of Steinberg to work on their first ever DAW called Studio One 1.0.<br />
That happened in 2009, and during the course of two years and a lot of updates, a new Studio One 2 was born.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify" align="center"><strong><em>The Features</em></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">Studio One has a state-of-the-art audio engine which delivers incredibly accurate sound, and its Professional version has a 64-bit floating-point version of that engine which automatically switches between 64-bit and 32-bit to accommodate 32-bit plug-ins. It has an integrated <em>Celemony Melodyne</em> pitch correction. Using Melodyne with other DAWs can be a gruesome task due to long latency of transfers from the track to Melodyne, and of course, the fact that Melodyne knows nothing about the edits of the track. Melodyne and Studio One are integrated so tightly, and you can say that Melodyne is practically a part of Studio One. With one click, your audio track is opened in the editor window with traditional Melodyne interface. No other DAW has this feature.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="wp-image-1883 aligncenter" style="border-style: initial;border-color: initial;cursor: default;border-width: 0px" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/studio-one-melodyne-389x205.jpg" alt="" width="389" height="205" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/studio-one-melodyne-389x205.jpg 389w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/studio-one-melodyne.jpg 615w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify">For quantizing multitrack drums, Studio One analyzes the tracks and does a phase-coherent quantization with very nice results. <em>Groove Panel</em> is the tool that does this.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="wp-image-1884 aligncenter" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/groove-panel-389x244.jpg" alt="" width="389" height="244" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/groove-panel-389x244.jpg 389w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/groove-panel-640x401.jpg 640w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/groove-panel.jpg 1277w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Simply drag and drop audio in the Groove Panel, and then quantize it. You can also extract the groove from one audio track and apply it to another audio track.</p>
<p>As far as I’ve seen it, Studio One has the best track and project organization out there. Keeping things organized is a breeze with <em>Folder Tracks</em> and <em>Track List</em>.<br />
Grouping tracks into folders is a one click process in Studio One. Simply select all of the tracks that you want, and then <em>right click</em> and select <em>Pack Folder </em>in the drop menu.<br />
Track List is similar to Pro Tools, you have a view of all of the tracks in your project, and simple selecting and de-selecting makes them visible in the project window.<br />
Also track list can be synced to Studio One mixer, so only selected tracks are visible in the mixer as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="../../../2012/11/15/scoring-with-presonus-studio-one-introduction/tracks-folders" rel="attachment wp-att-1885" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-1885 aligncenter" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Tracks-Folders-389x206.jpg" alt="" width="389" height="206" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Tracks-Folders-389x206.jpg 389w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Tracks-Folders-640x339.jpg 640w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Tracks-Folders.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Maybe the best feature of Studio One, besides Melodyne integration, is <em>Project</em>. When we talk about Projects we usually think about our project session in DAWs.<br />
Standard project is called <em>Song </em>in Studio One, and Project represents a mastering suite in Studio One. No other DAW offers a truly integrated mastering suite comparable to the Project page in Studio One Professional. In Project window, Studio One provides you with all of the necessary tools for mastering such as <em>Phase Meter, Spectrum Analyzer, Peak/RMS Level Meters</em>, and also is offers <em>DDP Export, PQ Editing, higher quality sample-rate conversion</em> etc&#8230; You can master your entire album in this window as a single project. You only need to arrange tracks as you want them, master each one individually(in the same window) and when you&#8217;re done, just burn the project directly to CD without any trouble.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="../../../2012/11/15/scoring-with-presonus-studio-one-introduction/mastering-window" rel="attachment wp-att-1886"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1886 aligncenter" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/mastering-window-389x223.jpg" alt="" width="389" height="223" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/mastering-window-389x223.jpg 389w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/mastering-window-640x367.jpg 640w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/mastering-window.jpg 1192w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Oh by the way, did I mention that Studio One is directly connected to your Sound Cloud account, so you can automatically upload your finished songs to Sound Cloud?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify"><strong><em>The Bundles</em></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">So what&#8217;s included in Studio One? There are Effects, Instruments and Bundled Content included in different versions of Studio One.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>EFFECTS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Distorzion</em> – Ampire FX(Guitar Amp Modeling Suite) and Red Light Distorzion.</li>
<li><em>Dynamics</em> – Channel Strip, Compressor, Expander, Gate, Limiter, Multiband Dynamics and Tricomp.</li>
<li><em>Equalization</em> – Pro EQ.</li>
<li><em>Meters And Analysis</em> – Level Meter, Phase Meter, Scope, Spectrum Meeter, Tone Generator and Tuner.</li>
<li><em>Modulation </em>– Auto Filter, Chorus, Flanger, Phaser and X-Trem.</li>
<li><em>Reverb &amp; Delay</em> <em>–</em> Analog Delay, Beat Delay, Groove Delay, Mixverb, Openair and Room Reverb.</li>
<li><em>Specialized –</em> Binaural Pan, Dual Pan, IR Maker, Mixtool and Pipeline.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">My experience with these effects is very positive. All of us here at SCOREcast are composers and we rely on our sample libraries, so you will agree that most of those libraries are already mixed nicely, and they don&#8217;t need much tampering with them. My motto is „If it sounds good, don&#8217;t change it“, so I am using as less as I can to mix my projects. I am using Pro EQ for adding just a little bit of color to my tracks and notching a bad frequency or two. The big bonus is that all of these bundled effects are very easy on the CPU, even if you are using an old dual core (unfortunately I&#8217;m one of those).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I know that most of you Logic lovers will state that Logic has the best bundled instruments out there, and I have to agree with you, but Studio One has a thing or two to offer in this area.<br />
The instruments are:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Impact</em></strong> – Sample trigger instrument for beat programming.<br />

				<description><![CDATA[In his introductory article at SCOREcast University, Jorge Costa gives a brief overview of what mixing is all about and gives a few starter tips to make our lives easier.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a brief introduction on a series, “Mixing / Mastering”. I&#8217;ll be sharing my visions so you can feel more conﬁdent improving your mixes and go deeper on your knowledge of the subject along the way.</p>
<p style="">Mixing may seem an overwhelming task (and it is an art form by itself) but it doesnʼt mean that you cannot learn a few principles along this series to get you conﬁdent in trying it yourself and practice on your own compositions. The same applies to a musician or a composer, itʼs great to have a degree, but in case you donʼt, youʼll still be able to compose or play and get better at it. Learn to use the tools needed for the job and tune you ears into it. I hope youʼll take great beneﬁt from the articles and they may give you extra ﬁnesse to your mixes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the mix youʼll have to recreate a sonorous stage, leveling the volume of the instruments, position in stereo ﬁeld and give them depth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mixing became a necessity when multitrack recorders made itʼs appearance on the second half of the twentieth century, allowing several tracks to be recorded at once or overdubbed. Then a mixing board was needed not only to track them ( ins and outs ) to the multitrack recorder but also to level whatʼs on tape to produce a master.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You have to be familiar with the routing of the signals both on a physical mixer or the one you have “in the box” (the DAW mixer) hence the need to understand the channel strip. It may seem daunting when you ﬁrst look at the mixer and see all those channels, have you ever thought “Iʼll never get that in my head”&#8230; well, that might be a little simpler than you think, forget “all those channels” for now, as the system itʼs modular, you have to learn only one channel as itʼs the same for every other track channels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In ours DAWs the mixer may be presented in a different order depending on the one you have, ins, outs, aux sends, eq, knobs, solo &amp; mute buttons and faders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="../../../?attachment_id=1649" rel="attachment wp-att-1649"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1649" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Pag-2-640x910.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="910" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Pag-2-640x910.jpg 640w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Pag-2-389x553.jpg 389w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Pag-2.jpg 761w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working inside the DAW you can beneﬁt of record and recall all your moves from automation parameters, such volume, pan, effects, plug-ins and midi control data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hereʼs a couple of tips on the listening environment and gain staging:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Monitors are very important, get the best your budget allows, remember that a $2 computer speaker wonʼt translate your mix, go for near ﬁeld monitors, that allows you to work and mix at a close distance, youʼll ﬁnd plenty on the market. Position them at your ears level, rotate the monitors towards you making a (60º degree angle) an equilateral triangle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the majority of our home studios doesn&#8217;t have proper isolation, mixing at low levels not only avoids too much room reﬂexions added to the direct sound but also prevent hearing fatigue that will reduce the time you can spend mixing with fresh ears.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However not so critical as in analog, itʼs wise to keep your master fader at unity gain (0 dB) and avoid to clip it at all times, making all the adjustments in the plugins youʼre using at the master if any, at instrument channel faders or instrument outs. That way you keep track of a clean signal without surprises.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Always leave a comfortable headroom for mastering! A good dynamic range is a key word in a good mix, loud doesnʼt mean better sounding! When adding a new plug-in, adjust the output level to peaking at the same value it had on the mix before you add it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you having a go for yourself, Multi band compression can be wisely used on the Master, when applied with moderation can be a great plus, avoid auto gain at all costs, as it can send the master fader signal to the roof (clipping) at least + 6dB on that move alone. Not to mention auto gain will send your precious &nbsp;mix down the drain. &nbsp;If limiter is you last plug-in in the chain, make sure to not clip its input ever. Also remember to use the most transparent limiter you can ﬁnd, usually the ones in our DAWs add some coloration, top plug-ins rule in mastering!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hope youʼve ﬁnd some useful tips here, stay tuned for the next articles. Comments and other suggestions are welcome. Please donʼt forget to read <a href="../../resources/scorecast-university/scu-mixing" target="_blank">Les Brockmann&#8217;s</a>&nbsp;great mixing articles.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-459" href="../../../2010/03/30/les-brockmann-mics-mixing-mastering/sig-brockmann-2"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-459" title="sig-brockmann" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sig-brockmann.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>Since, as a mixer, I&#8217;m not involved in the mysteries of a spotting session, this month&#8217;s column is going to be another in my series of &#8220;tech tips&#8221;, covering some engineering issues that have recently been in the air.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Just one mic?</span><br />
I&#8217;ve often been asked, by a composer with a personal studio, what microphone they might buy to record &#8220;everything&#8221; they need to. To engineers, it&#8217;s a nice luxury to work in a studio or scoring stage with a well-equipped microphone closet. Part of our expertise is to know and understand the subtle differences, the sonic signatures of fine microphones, and to choose which instruments are best complemented by which mics.</p>
<p>But of course, many folks haven&#8217;t got the budget for lots of microphones. So here&#8217;s my advice: an early investment by any aspiring composer should be at least one high quality microphone. I would go with a &#8220;condenser&#8221; model (the type that needs phantom power).</p>
<p>Condenser mics are sub-categorized into large and small diameter diaphragm, and both have certain advantages. A large-diaphragm mic will probably sound best on a singer, brass, or many kinds of solo instruments. Small-diaphragm mics are often favored on acoustic guitar, percussion, or in stereo pairs if you&#8217;ve got a group of instruments to mic at a bit more distance. (But we are talking about just one here-?) If in doubt, I think I would go with a large-diaphragm  —  it may not be perfect for everything but they are pretty versatile.</p>
<p>Unlike computers and digital audio gear, a high quality microphone, like most good analog gear, can be considered an investment that will last you your whole career. Buy a name brand and it will also retain resale value, should you ever need to convert it into cash. I still like the well-known European brands such as Neumann. You can&#8217;t go wrong with any of their products. At lower price points they often are cardioid only, rather than having multiple patterns, but that&#8217;s fine. Also good are Sennheiser, AKG (although most of their models will have a sound that is less warm; I prefer them on things that are percussive or need to sparkle). Audio-Technica has some decent models at a bit lower price point. There are no low-budget Chinese import mics that I recommend. Expect to spend at least $1000 for a good versatile microphone.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve recently been working with a percussionist who has been recording everything with a modest but decent microphone. On his project, he was about to start recording a singer when we spoke, and I suggested that he rent a nice Neumann U-87; he was thrilled about how much bigger and clearer that sounded. Don&#8217;t forget, at least here in the big city, you can rent that sort of thing by the day — I think he paid $30 delivered. That certainly seems worth it, doesn&#8217;t it? (Contact me for rental referrals in the LA area.)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mixing notes</span><br />
More projects are calling for cinema-type surround music mixes. In order to do this successfully in a personal studio, a full surround monitor system is essential, five speakers plus subwoofer. There&#8217;s no way to fake this on a stereo pair of speakers.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Discrete sub track versus &#8220;bass management&#8221;:</span> The &#8220;.1&#8221; in &#8220;5.1&#8221; refers to the subwoofer channel. In final dub mixing, with dialog, music, and effects, a mixer will commonly use a discrete sixth audio channel to reinforce big low sounds such as explosions. However, in score mixing, I will (almost) never put low music information on a separate channel. The proper way to set the sub in a music studio is so that it gives your main monitors added low-end response. The music mix tracks, particularly the three in the front, will have full frequency information.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my preference to not put anything of substantial music importance in the rear or surround speakers; some reverb or, in the case of live orchestra, distant microphones, will be sufficient to give you a sense of being enveloped by the sound. Don&#8217;t forget, in most theaters and also home environments, the rear speakers are usually small, often badly placed, unaligned, or broken. I wouldn&#8217;t put anything back there that I couldn&#8217;t live without. You also don&#8217;t want any sound to pull the attention of the audience away from the screen  —  what cinema sound guru Tomlinson Holman calls &#8220;the exit sign effect&#8221;, as in, you don&#8217;t want people to turn and look at the exit sign. The story is in front.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Does &#8220;mastering&#8221; apply to score mixing?</span><br />
I&#8217;ve recently been reading an excellent book, which I would highly recommend to all professional engineers, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Audio-Second-science-Book/dp/0240808371/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1269630630&amp;sr=1-1">“Mastering Audio: The art and the science” by Bob Katz</a>. It&#8217;s a real college level course on many fine details of audio mixing and processing, outboard gear usage, digital audio details, etc. The emphasis is on the sort of thing that would apply to album (CD) production, but with some good information about surround, DVD, and sound for picture as well.</p>
<p>One of the topics that he speaks very eloquently about is the &#8220;loudness wars&#8221; in which excessive compression and peak limiting is used to make music sound &#8220;louder&#8221;. He explains how and why this almost always makes music sound worse, not only because real good music has a dynamic range, but also because this never results in louder broadcast sound, only increased distortion.</p>
<p>Why should we care in the score business? In music for picture, there isn&#8217;t a mastering stage of production; your mastering engineer is your dubstage music mixer. Many composers are of the opinion that it helps somehow to put compression or peak limiting on their mix; some even have plug-ins to do this as part of their DAW template. I disagree. There&#8217;s no substitute or shortcut for mixing to an even and carefully considered balance, and of course checking with the dialog track turned on. <a href="../../../2009/11/technical-guidelines-for-film-and-tv.html">More info</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mac work</span><br />
I don&#8217;t solicit jobs installing software or building new computers, but occasionally a client asks me to do so. Things can get pretty complicated in putting together all the software that musicians depend on these days; it all has to work together smoothly, or you will have untold grief, as I&#8217;m sure we have all experienced.</p>
<p>I was recently reminded, again, of a truth that I will pass on as a public service. If you buy a new Macintosh, and choose to do the setup and software installation yourself, please bear this in mind: do not ever EVER use &#8220;Migration Assistant&#8221; to bring in settings or documents from your previous machine. This vomits lots of obsolete, incompatible, and potentially destructive preferences, drivers, and other code into the new machine. You&#8217;ll never get them out without reformatting the drive and starting over. Even if you think it will save time and money, just say no, do it the hard way. You will be glad you read and remembered this.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">More?</span><br />
I&#8217;m always happy to help people navigate the complexities and subtleties of engineering; it&#8217;s what I do for a living. What&#8217;s on your mind regarding recording and mixing music for the screen?

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/11/sig-brockmann.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-602" title="sig-brockmann" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/11/sig-brockmann.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>Recording and mixing music is a collection of skills that can take a lifetime to acquire. But almost every composer needs to do their own mixing sometimes, whether for a demo, low-budget project, or other reasons. The equipment keeps getting better and is widely available, especially with the computer software packages most composers work with. Let&#8217;s take a look at a few ideas and concepts about mixing music for the screen.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting up your studio</span><br />
First of all you need an appropriate place to listen and work. A deep discussion of room acoustics is too much for this article, but for a fantastic resource check out &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Acoustic-Design-Studio-Gallagher-Mitch/dp/159863285X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1258576292&amp;sr=1-1">Acoustic Design For The Home Studio</a>&#8221; by Mitch Gallagher. The physical layout and acoustics of the room that you are working in really do make a substantial difference in whether you can accurately hear what is in your mixes.</p>
<p>To start with, make sure your workstation and speakers are set in a good relation to each other. When you&#8217;re mixing, you will need to be directly facing the source of the sound, so your screen, keyboard and mouse, and mixing controller or console (if you have one) can&#8217;t be off to one side. Make sure your speakers are exactly at ear level when you&#8217;re sitting in your comfortable chair, and that your head and the two speakers form an equilateral triangle. A distance of four to five feet between the speakers and from each speaker to its corresponding ear is usually about right for a personal studio setup. Ergonomics are important; if your arms, hands, shoulders, or back hurt when you work you will never make it through the long career haul, so don&#8217;t scrimp on a crummy chair or an awkward reach.</p>
<p>The best way to learn what good mixing really sounds like is to sit right there and listen to a lot of recorded music from a variety of sources, including big-name film scores, as well as pop and classical music. Learn to think about tonal quality and balances; the mix is not the time to think about melody, orchestration, performance, or any other compositional or production details.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mix delivery</span><br />
When you are hired to do a score project, you will ultimately need to deliver the finished individual cues in a single mixed track or group of tracks, usually a computer file such as WAV or AIFF. Bear in mind it would never be right to deliver individual &#8220;raw&#8221; unmixed tracks — it is not the filmmaker&#8217;s job to mix your music on the final audio dub mix, just to balance it with all the other sound elements, dialog, effects, etc.</p>
<p>Occasionally you may be asked to separate out a melody track or some other part; this is called a &#8220;mix stem&#8221;.  The reason for this is, suppose in the final dub mix the filmmaker feels that a melody might be conflicting against a dialog line, for example. By having the melody on a separate track, this part can be turned down without having to turn down the entire cue. To prepare this, just make your mix as normal, and then record it twice (from the same start place): first all of the music but with the melody switched off, and then that melody track alone (including its reverb, etc.). When you listen to the two stems tracks together with equal levels it should sound just like you intended the mix. (For more about mix delivery, see my article &#8220;<a href="../../../2009/09/technical-guidelines-for-film-and-tv.html">Technical Guidelines for Film and TV Scoring — Part 1</a>&#8220;.)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mix chain plug-ins</span><br />
Recently I mixed a score for client in his studio computer, and afterwards he asked, why had I removed his &#8220;mastering plug-ins&#8221; from the master faders? He had previously done rough mixes, and his template included a compressor/limiter and an EQ. To start with, I had to explain what &#8220;mastering&#8221; means to an engineer:</p>
<p>Mastering is common in CD album work, and is a final processing step to make all the cuts on a CD sound consistent, and in particular, solve two problems. The first is that a contemporary album may have a number of different producers and engineers, and so the delivered mixes may vary widely in terms of level and EQ (top end/bottom end, etc.). A mastering engineer will use his tools to even things up and make every song match. However, a score mix is more likely to already be consistent in that respect (same engineer and the composer acting as producer).</p>
<p>The second task in CD mastering is level maximizing, using compression and limiting, in order to make the disc play loud and be &#8220;competitive&#8221; compared to other CDs. (This is usually demanded by record company people who don&#8217;t know much about good sound, or that good music can have dynamics.) Film score mixing is different in this respect — after the music is mixed and delivered then the film has its final &#8220;dub&#8221; sound mix in which all the sound elements are balanced. I guarantee, the music will NEVER be as loud as the dialog and effects. No matter how much you squash your music mix, that won&#8217;t have the slightest effect on making your music sound louder in the film soundtrack, or making your mix sound better balanced.</p>
<p>The filmmaker and the dubbing mixer make the choice of music volume. All pre-processing will get you is to hammer the life out of your music. Think of the dubbing mixer as your &#8220;mastering engineer&#8221;; he or she can make your music sound its best if you deliver good clean well-balanced mixes. (Tip:  If you do intend to use any mix chain plugins, make sure they are bypassed while you are making your mix, or you will be &#8220;chasing your tail&#8221;, with unintended consequences. And ALWAYS check your mixes with dialog.)</p>
<p>Also, be wary of pre-canned plug-in presets, both as &#8220;mastering chain&#8221; and in individual instrument channels. A few years back, there was a popular device called a Finalizer, the misuse of which (imho) did a lot to damage perfectly good mixes and deceive studio owners. It had a menu of presets for rock, classical, jazz, techno, etc., which called up a chain of compressors, limiters, and EQs already set to certain parameters. But think about it: is your Rock mix exactly like every other rock mix that anyone ever created?  Or, whatever style. The preset settings that might be appropriate for one example of a style are completely inappropriate for another example of similar style. There are simply too many variables that can go into production and mixing.</p>
<p>Plug-in presets are available in all the computer DAWs as well. For example, recent versions of Logic have these sorts of effect chains, in the &#8220;Library&#8221;. These are intended to take the mystery out of engineering for folks who don&#8217;t know much about it. But, watch out! Just like timing a scene or writing for the violin, there&#8217;s no excuse for not taking the time to really learn and understand how the tools of recording work, in order to get the most out of them.</p>
<p>In all the skills that go into creating great-sounding and competitive music, the more you know the better it will sound. And, best, your music will improve and you will know exactly why.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sig-brockmann.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-630" title="sig-brockmann" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sig-brockmann.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>Every composer would like to have the services of a fully qualified score mixing engineer on every project. You would, wouldn&#8217;t you? (Insert picture of smiling Score Engineer, like the one in my mirror.) As any specialist, he or she would bring a wealth of knowledge and experience that would make your life easier and your score sound better and more competitive.</p>
<p>But &#8211; &#8211; welcome to the real world &#8211; &#8211; I realize it doesn&#8217;t always work out that way. For reasons of budget and expediency a composer is often called on to record, mix, and submit a finished score on his or her own. As each composer must own the computers and other technical equipment that make our modern music business possible, it&#8217;s advantageous to know what to do when you need to, so that you can fend for yourself and compete.</p>
<p>For a dozen years I taught a class at UCLA Extension, in the Film Scoring program, called &#8220;Staying in Sync&#8221;. It started out being the &#8220;time code class&#8221; but evolved over the years to being all about digital audio, synchronization and timing issues, and miscellaneous studio tips for composers.</p>
<p>Here are some guidelines, in two categories. For those of you with a bit more experience this may serve as a review, and for others, a good starting checklist.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sample rate and bit depth</span></p>
<p>This topic needs to start with a discussion of delivery requirements. In every score project that you are ask to do, there will be specific technical requirements for the format for music delivery. You need to find out what those are from your client; don&#8217;t just go with &#8220;what ever you usually do&#8221;.</p>
<p>Most film and television scores are delivered at a sample rate of 48KHz, at bit depth of 24-bit. This is in contrast to music CD work, which has a sample rate of 44.1K at 16 bit. But, don&#8217;t just assume &#8211; &#8211; ask. Most software can do conversions between all the common sample rates and bit depths, but your product will sound better if you start out in the format of delivery.</p>
<p>I still sometimes hear, 48K sounds better than 44.1. This is a myth that got its start in the early days of digital audio. In the technology of digital audio the difference would theoretically amount to less than one-third octave above 20KHz (beyond the top end of human hearing). In reality today&#8217;s digital interfaces often have the same filtering for the two sample rates. However, what does make things sound (a bit) worse, and is a pain in the kiester besides, is sample rate conversion. Who wants to change all those files when you are finally finished and up against your deadline? Just go with the specified rate.</p>
<p>There is one exception to this that isn&#8217;t really an exception at all. Besides delivering the score, everyone wants good sounding recordings for the &#8220;demo reel CD&#8221;. For this you will have to do sample and bit rate conversion, to 44.1-16. Just use the highest quality conversion setting available in your software and it will be fine. You can do this after the deadline has passed and you have some spare time.</p>
<p>What about the high sample rates that some software and hardware supports these days &#8211; &#8211; 88.1, 96, 176.2, 192? In some cases that may be worth it to a small degree, such as extremely high fidelity orchestral recording. But bear in mind that some aspects of your system may not be compatible with those rates, such as software synths, and you will still have to do a conversion before delivery. Plus, recording at higher rates will consume a ton of hard drive space, like filling a bathtub with a fire hose.</p>
<p>Now for bit depth. 24-bit has become industry standard, superceding 16-bit. You should definitely go with 24-bit. Just set everything that way and leave it. Why? In a nutshell, digital audio becomes cleaner (less distortion) the louder you record, up to 0, where the red light comes on &#8211; &#8211; whoops, distortion, &#8220;sorry, you played great but can we get that once again please?&#8221; 24-bit has a wider &#8220;sweet spot&#8221; where it sounds good, so you don&#8217;t have to have everything quite so loud. Also, mixing &#8220;in the box&#8221;, plugins, etc. all sound better at 24-bit. If your delivery requirements are 16-bit for mixes, make the conversion at the end and you will still have good sound.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Time code</span></p>
<p>SMPTE time code used to be a complicated big deal &#8211; &#8211; I taught a whole six-week class on it. Fortunately things have gotten a lot simpler these days.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s review: time code is basically a way of numbering the frames of a film, video, or audio recording. It gives you location information, and allows video and audio to be synchronized together. There are several different formats of time code, based on the number of frames per second of a particular video format, i.e. film or television. Our audio software can work with any type time code, but has to be manually set to the same format as your video.</p>
<p>For a score project, you will typically be supplied with a Quicktime video file, and (you may have to specify this) it should have on the picture a visible box with time code numbers (sometimes called visual time code or window burn). (Linear time code on an audio channel is unnecessary.) It&#8217;s customary for the first frame of program picture (not including leader) to be at a time code address of eight frames past 01:00:00:00. The numbers should start ten or more seconds before that, to allow for a preroll, although the software doesn&#8217;t really need it. Sometimes the start mark will be in the neighborhood of 2 hours, or greater, such as in a film score that has more than one reel. However, the time code should never start with 00:00:00:00. The very first frame of the video should start with &#8220;rolling&#8221; numbers, that is, no frozen frame members and then starting after a few seconds. Time code should be continuous and never stop or skip. If (horrors!) they re-cut the video they will have to generate new time code, but the very first frame of program should be the same number it was before.</p>
<p>The frame format and numbering decisions will usually be made by a post-production supervisor or video/film editor, who will use the editing software to stripe continuous time code numbers on the frames. Hopefully they will tell you what the time code format is, or in Quicktime software you can use the &#8220;Movie Inspector&#8221; under the Windows menu. Make sure your software is set to match.</p>
<p>Besides the various frame rates, there is the issue of drop frame. Two of the most common time code formats are 29.97 drop frame and 29.97 non drop frame. Explaining the distinction between those two would be a fine cure for insomnia, but suffice to say they are not the same; again, find out what format is on your video and set the software or machine to match.</p>
<p>I should also mention that there&#8217;s a new format of time code, 23.976, which is there to accommodate new HD video formats. I know that Digital Performer 6 can work with those, but DP5 cannot &#8211; &#8211; you may have to upgrade.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SrWl7dM0OQI/AAAAAAAAALI/l5o1e0v8BU4/s1600-h/DP+Time+code+menu-2e2.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SrWl7dM0OQI/AAAAAAAAALI/l5o1e0v8BU4/s320/DP+Time+code+menu-2e2.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Frame rate menu in Digital Performer 6</span></span></div>
<p>Once the video is imported into your composing software there are two steps: first you must set the software so that its time code numbers equal what is on the video screen.  In Pro Tools this is called &#8220;spotting&#8221;; in DP it is &#8220;set movie start&#8221;.  Other apps have similar settings. Make the numbers match the very first number in the video. Then, second, set bar 1 beat 1 of your cue to the time code number in which you want it to start.</p>
<p>In a professional organization of which I&#8217;m a member, another score mixer sent out promos for a seminar in which he was going to teach composers what they needed to know about score engineering. I&#8217;m sure he had many wise things to say, but my eye was caught by his assertion that &#8220;there is a particular time code format that every composer should insist on&#8221;. In case this has caused any misconceptions, let me clear this up &#8211; &#8211; under no circumstances that I have ever seen did a composer have the choice of what type of time code will be used. Someone else makes that choice. It&#8217;s no big deal &#8211; &#8211; just find out what type is being used.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">More to come</span><br />
I&#8217;ve got some things to say about score mixing, both technical and &#8220;artistic&#8221;, but looks like this is about enough for this time. I want to cover some things about plug-ins, and of course I won&#8217;t forget &#8220;stems mixing&#8221;, so check back with me for Part 2.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/08/sig-brockmann.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-647" title="sig-brockmann" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/08/sig-brockmann.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>I got my start recording score music for episodic television a couple of decades ago, when the personal studio trend was just getting going in a big way.  Among many others, I engineered music for the <a class="zem_slink" title="American Broadcasting Company" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company">ABC</a> series <em>thirtysomething </em><span style="font-style: normal;">with composers Stewart Levin and Snuffy Walden, and then </span><em>Northern Exposure</em><span style="font-style: normal;"> with composer David Schwartz. Both started out in fairly modest home studio settings with simple gear, and as the shows and composers gained more success, their studios became more sophisticated. They wrote some of the coolest music I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of working on, and I still remember those experiences fondly.</span></p>
<div class="MsoNormal">So, I am way familiar with the &#8220;standard&#8221; model of how most television scoring is done these days, based on multitrack production techniques, using MIDI and audio tracks. Each part is carefully crafted and laid in, one at a time, until it sounds complete. Mixing might be done right then when the cue is finished (if the composer also wears the mixer hat) or at the end when all the cues are finished, in which case it&#8217;s often a long late rush for the mixer to finish and make the delivery deadline.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">But there is another way to crack that weekly score recording nut, and that&#8217;s with a live studio date with live real-time mixing. This may seem like an old-fashioned approach at first, but there are some great advantages, with very contemporary techniques, for the composer with an appropriate musical style and the courage to go for it. It can give you some of your life back, for one thing, with no more red-eyed late nights cranking out mixes, and may even be more budget-friendly then you might suppose. Most importantly, there&#8217;s nothing like the excitement of putting expert musicians in a room together; they will almost always give you more than you could ever come up with by yourself, and make it look easy.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Let&#8217;s take a look at a couple of recent scores I worked on, and their productions:</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Secret Life</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Composer Dan Foliart has scored dozens of the most successful shows on TV, so I was excited to get the call recently to work with him on an episode of <em><a class="zem_slink" title="The Secret Life of the American Teenager (Season 1)" rel="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1179817/">The Secret Life Of The American Teenager</a> </em><span style="font-style: normal;">(ABC Family), to record at the famous Capitol Studio B. Dan has always been a big proponent of live players mixed live, and hires some of the best musicians in LA, so I knew this was going to be fun.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><a style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BuLoKjFVAyg/SoTOu0AfI8I/AAAAAAAAAAM/q9KbO1A_6ho/s1600-h/23_DF_DFoliart_Capitol_mid.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5369643959362462658" style="display: block; height: 315px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 282px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BuLoKjFVAyg/SoTOu0AfI8I/AAAAAAAAAAM/q9KbO1A_6ho/s400/23_DF_DFoliart_Capitol_mid.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>Certain types of parts in a score work better performed &#8220;live&#8221; than others; synth/sample type parts are often better prepared and pre-recorded in advance. Dan&#8217;s &#8220;synthestrator&#8221;, Steve Morrell, records his parts, and also a click track, at home in Logic and then brings it in on a disk on where it&#8217;s imported into Pro Tools before the other musicians arrive. It comes up on extra faders where I balance it in with the other instruments.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">The mix we hear in the control room is approved by Dan, but there are a couple of levels of safety net. Separate instrument tracks are saved in Pro Tools, in case there needs to be an overdub or a remix is requested. In addition, in the computer session file, the mixed tracks are routed to separate &#8220;stems&#8221;, divided into sections of the mix such as rhythm, guitars, keyboards, etc. That way on the dub stage, if the mixer puts up all tracks equally then he will hear it as I did, but if he wishes, he can duck certain parts, such as if a melody conflicts with dialog. (&#8220;Stems&#8221; mixing is often requested by producers; in a future column I will go into more detail explaining exactly how it should be done.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">Now for the cool part! Dan&#8217;s well-oiled team of session players made quick work of the cues, adding their unique controlled excitement and sparkle. His band of drums, percussion, piano, bass, and guitar knew just what to do. With a few notes to them by Dan on performance, and to me on the sound, the score was in the can within a three-hour date. In fact there was a few minutes to spare for a couple of Frank Sinatra songs, just for fun! And my work was basically done and off the clock at the same time as the musicians. Ship it! Lunch!</span></p>
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> King of the Hill<span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Composer Greg Edmonson has been scoring episodes of the animated comedy, <em>King of the Hill (</em><span style="font-style: normal;">Fox)</span><em>, </em><span style="font-style: normal;">for a few years now. A typical show might have as many as 30 music starts. After spotting, he gets busy writing in his personal studio, and then works with his long-time guitarist, </span>Craig Stull, recording audio tracks there in Logic.</p>
<p>In order to carefully produce and layer the guitar parts, they are recorded in advance. In the case of <em>King of the Hill,</em><span style="font-style: normal;"> maybe half of the total score is guitar-only cues, often with 2, 3, or more layered guitar parts, electric, acoustic, dobro. The remainder of the score will also feature a small orchestra, usually as the plot gets more intense or comes to a conclusion. On these cues there are also often guitar parts, which are layered in advance (with temp synth orchestra).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span>With me at the board, we balance and process the guitar parts and lay down a stereo mix track in Logic, as well as an audio track of click, and any other final elements will usually get their own stereo mix track or &#8220;stem&#8221;. I note the time code at that tracks&#8217; start time (not the same as the downbeat, bar 1 beat 1); this will be used in the next step, which is to place these tracks into the scoring template in <a class="zem_slink" title="Pro Tools" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Tools">ProTools</a> HD.</p>
<p>So, after pre-mixing and exporting those audio files, we switch off Logic and turn to ProTools, where I import them and spot them to the correct time code positions. Note that in Logic there is a separate file for each cue, but in ProTools all of the cues will be in the same single session file. That is so on the scoring stage with the orchestra sitting there no one will have to fool around with opening and closing computer files, and re-assigning inputs and outputs.</p>
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">This is where I pass the engineering baton to the venerable mixer, Armin Steiner, who mixes the small orchestra (about 20 players) live in a scoring stage or commercial studios, to additional ProTools tracks. There&#8217;s no additional time to remix after the sessions; when the players go home so does he. On the dubstage they will have available separate stems of orchestra, guitar, and other elements, if they need to re-balance. If all goes according to plan, they can knock off the orchestra recording in a two-hour session. It doesn&#8217;t seem like much, but it doesn&#8217;t take long for the magic to happen, and, once again, the added polish, sparkle, and thrill of the expert live musicians playing together raises the vibe and quality of this simple animated show to a new level.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><strong>Living &#8220;live&#8221;</strong></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">If your score style involves a lot of your own layered performances, or multiple overdubbed tracks by individual musicians, then live tracking may not be for you. But if you can imagine your music played by a band or orchestra, or can adapt your music to that scenario, then why not give it a try? With a good studio and a good team behind you, it&#8217;s a great way to quickly make music that&#8217;s exciting; how can that not be a good thing?</div>
