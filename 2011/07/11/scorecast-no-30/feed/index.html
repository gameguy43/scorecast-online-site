					<description><![CDATA[Deane and Brian,

Great episode!  Can&#039;t wait for the next one.

UJAM.  Hmmm.....

It sounds like an Easy Bake Oven.  Here&#039;s the problem: we&#039;re not 5 years old. There is a standard that must be met in every industry and ours is no different.  mr. Hughes, I&#039;m sure you can attest to that being a studio owner and composer.

Look, I&#039;m new to the scene, but I&#039;ve already figured out that to be competitive in the music composing biz I HAVE to be a computer engineer (figuratively speaking).  I have to study how my computer and it&#039;s software works...not to mention keeping up with the latest gear (which is a daily affair).  I have to do this just as much as I have to study music itself.  It is what it is.  If you&#039;re not willing to invest fully in whatever it is you do, you shouldn&#039;t be doing it.

Think about it this way: if the catch line is &quot;take the composer out of composing,&quot; who the heck is buying this product?  A composer???

It sounds like a cool app for the iPhone or an iPad....but beyond that, I&#039;d expect to see something like this on late night television. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Russ,

&quot;Do I understand you correctly? That to be the writer of a great book you have to understand spelling, grammar and perhaps even have some accreditation and also be able to use a word processor? Please tell me you&#039;re not saying that?&quot;
I won&#039;t speak for Deane, but I will say that if you were asking me this question, I would reply with a resounding &quot;Yes.&quot;

It is such an unfortunate reality that now more than ever before, we let people get away with thinking that, when it comes to the arts &quot;You should know the technical aspects of your craft, but if you don&#039;t and you have talent, you&#039;ll be fine.&quot;

These days anybody who writes a blog is a &quot;writer&quot;

Anybody who splashes a bunch a different colors on a canvas is a &quot;painter&quot;

Anybody who records crying whales and plays the tape in an auditorium while banging on pots and pans can be called a &quot;composer&quot;

This happens in writing, music, and painting more than in any other discipline I can think of right now.

Why? Why should we accept that writers, painters and composers don&#039;t *have to* have the same level of technical knowledge than, say, surgeons? or a lawyers? Why should a film composer not have the same knowledge of his craft and train with the same discipline as ballet dancer?

Imagine this exchange between two people: 

- So, you tell me you&#039;re a surgeon. Where did you go to school? 

- I didn&#039;t, but I have a lot of talent, and I watched all 15 season of &quot;ER,&quot; twice. Also, I&#039;ve been watching &quot;House&quot; every week since it came out. Oh, and a few years ago I read an anatomy book. Is anybody really going to argue that if it were you listening to this &quot;doctor&quot; you would just nod in approval and give him a call if you ever needed to get, I don&#039;t know, a triple bypass? 

Exactly. We shouldn&#039;t expect less from a professional film composer. And that was, in my case, the point I was trying to get across. 

To be completely clear:

1.I believe UJam is a fun little toy for people to play around with. Maybe it&#039;ll lead to some people who are serious about music to pursue further training in it, maybe it won&#039;t. However, if you believe that knowing how to use UJam and talent is all that&#039;s needed to be a professional film composer, you&#039;re delusional. 

2. I&#039;m not part of any sort of &quot;musical elite&quot; that believes that the film music industry should only give access to those with strict classical training and years of experience. We wouldn&#039;t have Elfman or Zimmer if that were the case. I do believe, however, that not everybody has Elfman or Zimmer-like talent.

Talent alone will get you nowhere, no matter how big that talent is. That&#039;s why a Danny Elfman or a Hans Zimmer only happens every so often. It also explains why a lot of immensely talented people fail at film music, and why people who couldn&#039;t write a decent orchestral cue to save their life have more success than most of us will likely ever see. 



I&#039;m looking at you, Reznor.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Deane, appreciate you taking the time to write such a thorough and carefully worded reply.

However, I must (as I guess you would expect) disagree with you with most of what you have said.

The assumptions made in your reply are staggering, for example &#039;that a person who is going to simply fire up UJAM and start cranking out noise is fooling themselves by thinking they have any &quot;talent&quot; at all&#039;. You seem to confuse talent with accreditation and understanding, they are simply not the same thing.

Do I understand you correctly? That to be the writer of a great book you have to understand spelling, grammar and perhaps even have some accreditation and also be able to use a word processor? Please tell me you&#039;re not saying that?

Yes I agree you have a better chance of making a career from anything if you understand the principles of the craft, work hard and use the best equipment, but on the other side I do not see why anyone should be excluded from expresses themselves because they are lacking in any of the aforementioned. Furthermore, if they then manage to find an audience, large or small, that appreciates their creative offering then who am I to judge the validity of their expression.

As to Hans&#039; motivation in supporting UJAM, I dare not say - as Franklin once said &#039;I do not judge the motivation of others as it&#039;s hard enough to judge my own&#039;. Even if as you suggest he takes the &#039;paths of least resistance&#039;, who the hell wants to take the line of worst resistance? I don&#039;t think you&#039;re going to get a large show of hands on that vote.

Finally the &#039;dumbing down&#039; line is frankly an easy jibe at anything that one does not approve of or understand. Has American Idol or Got Talent dumbed down the process of making it in the entertainment industry? Possibly, but all the record company executives who spent years protecting their own thiefdoms at the expense of both signed and unsigned artists have only themselves to blame. I suppose an artist that home-records and self promotes their album via a blog (complete with spelling and grammar errors) isn&#039;t really a recording artist?

I&#039;m sorry you felt so defensive by my second reply to Derlis, it was meant in a more general sense hence me using the sentence &#039;of our own journey&#039;, it was meant to include myself. I&#039;m not perfect and know how easy it is for me to want to react to new things based on my ignorance of history, forgetting where I came from or fear of the future - usually a combination of all three. If you do not have any such issues, then brilliant, you are certainly one in a million - and if you feel misjudged, then please forgive me it was not my intention.

However, please do not confuse &#039;who is authorised&#039; and &#039;who as access&#039; as the same thing, they are not. It&#039;s an old issue that has been faced by the church, by the media and many other parts of society when faced with the possibility that the &#039;unauthorised&#039; may start practising in their area of expertise.

I&#039;ve always tried to be one of those open people in life and tried to give-away what I have learnt for the benefit of many, a run a large blog to support up and coming talent and have been thrilled to support literally thousands of thousands of musicians trying to express their creativity, it would be crass for me to name the site here, so I will refrain from any cheap advertising. 

I say this just to explain why I do; it is simply this - I got where I am through the generosity of others and I feel I should pass it on - even if that means my students end up getting the gigs I used to get. I won&#039;t be here for ever and if UJAM enables one of my kids to write me a wonderful song for my funeral then good for them! Easy or hard!]]></description>

<p>I&#8217;ve always tried to be one of those open people in life and tried to give-away what I have learnt for the benefit of many, a run a large blog to support up and coming talent and have been thrilled to support literally thousands of thousands of musicians trying to express their creativity, it would be crass for me to name the site here, so I will refrain from any cheap advertising. </p>
<p>I say this just to explain why I do; it is simply this &#8211; I got where I am through the generosity of others and I feel I should pass it on &#8211; even if that means my students end up getting the gigs I used to get. I won&#8217;t be here for ever and if UJAM enables one of my kids to write me a wonderful song for my funeral then good for them! Easy or hard!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Russ,

I completely understand where you are coming from, and if the context was paralleled from both our sides, I might even concur. However, I think you are widely missing the point that Brian were making in this episode. Neither of us believe that technology advances are bad or detrimental to any industry, musical or no. Nor are we coming from a place of, as you put it in another comment, &quot;ignorance of history, forgetfulness of our own journey of growth and a fear of the future.&quot; Not in the least bit. I think if you listen back to the history of SCOREcast, you&#039;d be operating out of a sense of ignorance to suggest such a silly thing as it pertains to what Brian and I both stand for. Clearly we understand the history of film music (which is the platform from which we both are speaking) and we both hold a healthy anticipation for what the future holds for our industry.

I won&#039;t speak for Brian (although I know I could in saying this), but what I believe is so telling and educational in *your* statements is the fact that you insist on presenting scenarios that assume a baseline knowledge of whatever craft or specialty you are arguing in favor of. For example, you ask in your follow-up comment to Derlis below  &quot;Is an accountant who uses a spreadsheet a cheat? Or a professor who uses a calculator lazy?&quot; In these scenarios, you are assuming that the accountant knows how to &quot;account&quot; or the math professor knows how to &quot;identify numbers&quot;. Spreadsheets used without a baseline knowledge of organization of information are useless, as are calculators used by someone who does not know a &quot;2&quot; from a &quot;5&quot;. Likewise, what Brian and I are saying is that a person who is going to simply fire up UJAM and start cranking out noise is fooling themselves by thinking they have any &quot;talent&quot; at all—at least, as defined by the traditional trends of film music creation—UNLESS they first seek to understand even the most minimal basics of what they are doing to create that sound. To take it a step further (and more in the realm of what we mentioned on the podcast), to use such an instrument or device to create a score for a motion picture requires so much more than is even available in the software to begin with, which was the impetus for our inquiry as to why Zimmer is involved at all. The first point being: In this day and age of filmmaking where a &quot;talent of speed&quot; is the demanded specialty, we personally long for filmmakers to continue regarding it as such: a specialty better left to specialists. The second point being: Is Hans interested from a benevolent &quot;musicality for all&quot; approach, or for what he&#039;s been arguably accused of over the course of a very distinguished and progressive career in filmmusic... the tendency to employ &quot;paths of least resistance&quot; to achieve award-winning soundtracks.

Lastly, because you decided to slip a &quot;barb&quot; in there about our knee-jerk reactions based on &quot;arrogance&quot;, I&#039;d like to comment on your children and how you folded them into this conversation. I think it&#039;s very responsible of you to want to encourage your children to express themselves musically. You&#039;re a very well articulated guy, so I don&#039;t doubt for a second that they are all well educated, hard working, talented, and bright. All the more reason for you to not leave any part of their musical (or educational) development in the hands of anything but Dear Old Dad&#039;s long-studied understanding of the ROI&#039;s of hard musical work. I would challenge you to *really* engage with them over their musical development (which I&#039;m sure you already do to a large extent) if you think music is something that truly enriches their lives. By leaving even a fraction of their musical equipping to a piece of software which does all of the work for them, what are you really doing to further their educational foundations? Nothing. As someone who makes their living &quot;from both composing and running studios&quot; as you stated above, You have no excuse. It would be a travesty above all travesties for anyone from Russ Hughes&#039; family to have their musical development fall to a computer product that was made *specifically for cutting corners*. From an outside observer, in addition to abdicating your role as your children&#039;s &quot;expert&quot; musical guide (after all, dad *is* a studio boss and composer!), you are also letting them escape with the easy way out. They can essentially turn their brains off, not have to learn anything, and just create &quot;music&quot; while watching SpongeBob Squarepants simultaneously. Awesome.

The case study of your children can be applied across all plains of creative output, while (admittedly) propping up UJAM as the punching bag. Look, I&#039;m not a pie-in-the-sky, Pollyannish ignorant by any means... But I sure would like to see a few things in this world not go the way of McDonald&#039;s beef farming, Old Navy&#039;s offshore child labor loopholes, or Nike&#039;s shoe construction: Dumbed-down to the point of humans just falling in-line because... oh, what the hell... it&#039;s *just* easier!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Loved this scorecast. &quot;Why would I align with people that act like this&quot; Exactly, guys. If the AMCL does nothing to promote themselves or involve us the composer in the process of actually getting a union started, what are they going to do for us if/when they do form one? 

Sure there might be some processes that need to be kept close to the vest, but there is a lot of things that they could be telling us. They could even be discussing what the composers would like to see the union be able to provide for the composers.

The production music libraries have the PMA (Production Music Association) and guess what, Music Supervisors are starting one. In the meantime the AMCL  seems to be floundering. Both of which as far as I know are national and not aligning themselves to just a local.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My children are all well educated, hard working, talented and bright. They can operate a computer and can be bothered to learn, but just because you can walk a hundred miles it doesn&#039;t mean you have to.

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think Deane
and Brian are worried that this will disrupt the musical elite (if I misread
your comment, I apologize). I think the problem with this is that it may lead
to a lot of people thinking that they are now composers, arrangers, orchestrators,
etc and if it catches on, no doubt there will be, somewhere, some producer
who&#039;ll get someone to score their film using this instead of getting a composer
who actually knows what they&#039;re doing. 

 

I see this as a harmless piece of software for folks
who aren&#039;t serious about music to play around with. I&#039;m all for more people
having the chance to play around with whatever musical abilities they have. However, if
someone ever comes up to me and says something like &quot;Look at the film
score I wrote! I did it with UJam!&quot; I will laugh in their face. 

 

I think the guys are more worried about the worst ways
in which this could be used, not about how many more people get to make
music. 

 

Also, I must disagree with your &quot;[you
need a] computer science degree or [to know] Simon Cowell.&quot; comments. 

 

There is no way, NO WAY that anyone born after 1985
will have any trouble using some of the simple recording software out there. If
you&#039;ve ever operated a stereo, you should be able to figure out your basic way
around something like garage band. STOP, PLAY, RECORD. That and how to plug in
a cheap mic to your computer is all you need to know if you really, really,
really just want to get a tune out of your head. Iphones have voice recorders
for God&#039;s sake!

If you really can&#039;t operate (or be bothered to learn) some of the basic, simple
recording software out there, then you&#039;re probably not good with computers to
begin with. Either that or you&#039;re just lazy in which case, you should just find something else to do.

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, this was a great episode. I read the same ad Brian mentioned when it just came out. I Think it popped up on a twitter search. I remember reading it and thinking &quot;this is nuts!&quot; but, at the same time, I can&#039;t deny that for a few seconds, I actually asked myself &quot;I wonder if I could make that deadline?&quot;
The ad was way too sketchy though and I&#039;m glad I ignored it. 

There are tons of ads like that one floating around, which is quite sad. And what you said, Deane, couldn&#039;t be more true: We&#039;ve all been there.  

Looking forward to the next episode!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#039;One day someone is going to get an Emmy or Oscar for a song created with UJAM!&#039; Great quote, I couldn&#039;t have said it better myself.

I&#039;m happy being open to new technologies, surely someone using of a sample library in a score could be accused of taking the easy way? The same arguments were made of the printing press, railways et al, progress is inevitable. If this enables more people make music then this is a good thing? Right now music creation is dependent not only on talent but also the skill to use the right software or the right people. This is the start of musical democracy - the only people who would want to stop that would be the musical elite (before you ask I make my money from both composing and running studios) but my kids want to get the tunes out of their heads and into a recording without needing a computer science degree or knowing Simon Cowell.

I&#039;m glad not to be a member of the flat-earth society and feel excited that Hans Zimmer is progressive and open enough to create something that opens up music creation to more people. If anyone could have a good reasons to take an elitist and protectionist approach then surely it would be Hans? Instead he is promoting a more open music making world - it says something about the real heart of this man - I applaud him.]]></description>
