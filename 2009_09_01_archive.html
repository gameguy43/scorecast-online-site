</div><span style="font-size: small;"><b>#9 - THE DARK KNIGHT<i>&nbsp;</i></b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><b><i>(Hans Zimmer &amp; James Newton-Howard)</i></b></span><br />
<br />
Following the success of their collaboration for Christopher Nolan's reboot of the Batman franchise <i>Batman Begins</i>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001877/">Hans Zimmer</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006133/">James Newton-Howard</a> reteamed in 2008 to score  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/"><i><b>THE DARK KNIGHT</b></i></a> &#8212; the decidedly darker follow-up  fueled almost single-handedly by Heath Ledger's iconic performance as "The Joker".<br />
<br />
At first, what seemed like an odd pairing turned out to be one of the most effective once Zimmer and Newton-Howard unleashed their <i>Batman Begins</i> score on the world in 2005. But what followed for Round 2 from the duo was a complete about-face from <i>Batman Begins</i>.  <i><b>THE DARK KNIGHT</b></i> boasted a tone all its own that traversed a darker and much more visceral soundscape, utilizing string and brass effects combined with electronic elements to bring edge and power to the series. In addition, Newton-Howard's emotional themes lifted the story to more dramatic heights than it's predecessor, providing more of an intimate look into the heart of Bruce Wayne. <br />
<br />
Without saying too much and risk giving away some great debate points, we'll conclude by reminding everyone that ultimately, this was the score that brought to the surface the long-debated Zimmer practice of doling out additional music credits amongst his team, thus costing he and Newton-Howard an Oscar nomination, according to then Academy rules regarding the number of names on cue sheets. Then, in typical Academy fashion, the committee reversed its own rule and allowed the nomination for the score.<br />
<br />
Why is Zimmer and Newton-Howard's music for <i><b>THE DARK KNIGHT</b></i> so influential? How does it differ from other scores in the same genre  in the last ten years? Does it compete with the work the two have done for other feature films in any way? Is it up to par with that work?<br />
<br />
Most interestingly, how has the music of <i><b>THE DARK KNIGHT</b></i> affected your composing style or your thoughts on composing in the same genre? What other scores have you heard that are obviously influenced by <i><b>THE DARK KNIGHT</b></i>?<br />

</div><span style="font-size: small;"><b>#10 - LOST</b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><b><i>(Michael Giacchino)</i></b></span><br />
<br />
Since its debut on September 22, 2004, ABC's "<i><b><a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411008/" rel="imdb" title="Lost (TV series)">LOST</a></b></i>" has created a niche trend in dramatic television and has been responsible in many ways for pushing the envelope of the power of cinematic television. Created by <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0009190/" rel="imdb" title="J. J. Abrams">J.J. Abrams</a> <i>(Alias, Mission Impossible III, Star Trek)</i>, the show centers around a group of people who survive a plane crash on a deserted island. That's the short version... the long version is an engrossing tale of supernatural events, intertwining destinies, and chance happenings, all mixed together in a carefully crafted series that is still running strong on weekly primetime.<br />
<br />
From the start, it was clear that the music for <i><b>LOST</b></i>, composed by frequent Abrams collaborator <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0315974/" rel="imdb" title="Michael Giacchino">Michael Giacchino</a>, is as carefully constructed and thought out as the show itself. With music written in "linear" fashion, Giacchino has developed his musical characteristics for <i><b>LOST</b></i> by slowly stirring the plot lines to a calm boil. He has also chosen to score the show with a live orchestra (a rarity in this day and age), but an interesting twist on a live orchestra at that (see video below for a tour through a LOST scoring session).<br />
<br />
Why is Giacchino's music for <i><b>LOST</b></i> so influential? How does it differ from other scores that have been written in the last ten years for television, AND... does it compete with the work he has done for feature film in any way? Is it up to par with that work?<br />
<br />
Most interestingly, how has the music of <i><b>LOST</b></i> affected your composing style or your thoughts on composing in the same genre? What other shows or scores have you heard that are obviously influenced by <i><b>LOST</b></i>?<br />

</div>Just yesterday, I had a conversation with a director friend of mine who I just finished a film for. We were talking about <i>work ethic</i> and <i>perseverance</i> in our industry, and we found that we had quite differing views on certain aspects of how hard you have to work to sustain a healthy career making movies.<br />
<br />
My view has always been &#8212; and I've stated this here before &#8212; that since I am a film composer to the bone, there is nothing else that I will ever do, or <i>could</i> do. How hard I am willing to work to maintain what I have achieved in the time that I've been actively pursuing my composing career as well as the work it is going to take to get me where I want to be in 10 years is something that I am willing to undertake no matter the cost, immediate family notwithstanding.<br />
<br />
I believe it was Jai Meghan who posed a question during one of this month's post-column conversations, and it didn't get any responses, which I thought was extremely interesting. During a confab on <i>scheduling</i>, Jai asked (and I'm paraphrasing here...),<br />
<blockquote>"If Sony gave you "The Green Hornet" to score in a week, would you take the job if you didn't feel you had enough time to score the film the way you would with more time?"<br />
</blockquote>Well... <i>would you?</i> I would! I'd take it in an instant and do my absolute level best to make it the greatest score I could considering the time-frame they'd given me.<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm curious about in this edition of the Composers' Confab is <i><b>where do you consider your level of dedication to this game we call film scoring, and are you on the right road to getting to your next level in the industry? Are you a fan, a hobbyist, a weekend warrior, a semi-professional composer, or a sold-out, full-time, died-in-the-wool professional... and are you happy with your position in the mix?</b></i><br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SsB9wepf5OI/AAAAAAAAANY/b_w_-E18zJg/s1600-h/8cxp1x3ZStUxZAkqGy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SsB9wepf5OI/AAAAAAAAANY/b_w_-E18zJg/s320/8cxp1x3ZStUxZAkqGy.jpg" /></a><br />
</div>I'm curious about this both in terms of fiscal priority (if you aren't making money from your scores, then you cannot truly call yourself a "professional composer yet, right?) as well as a "goal-oriented" perspective. Where do you <u><i>want</i></u> to be in 10 years? Are you happy with where you are at now? What kinds of things do you see that need to be done to take you to the next level in your career? Do you think you are ready for professional representation (be honest!)? Is your writing at such a level that you feel you need some more work on it before you are ready to score a feature? Have you scored so many features that you've lost count, and now you are struggling to "love" the craft like you once did? Is your career perfect and in need of no alterations?<br />
<br />
Where are you and where are you wanting to be?<br />
<br />
Discuss.</div>

We thrive on <i>input.<span style="font-style: normal;">&nbsp;</span></i><br />
<br />
<i><span style="font-style: normal;">To the extent that we personalize that input&#8212;that we A) choose it carefully in the first place, and B) develop it into something effective and original&#8212;we could be considered mature composers. It's a truism that as artists we begin with an "imitative phase," in which we tend to mimic works that already exist. Somewhere along the line, though, all the disparate influences coalesce into something new. Something unique to us. It's a process that relies on our <b>locus of cool</b>&#8212;that collection of existing musical elements that resonate with us. That move and inspire us.</span></i><br />
<div><div><br />
</div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hCspY__CLOo/Srw9l6r8xJI/AAAAAAAAAGU/ggYKECs1swE/s1600-h/dc-101.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5385246976046318738" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hCspY__CLOo/Srw9l6r8xJI/AAAAAAAAAGU/ggYKECs1swE/s320/dc-101.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 213px; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; width: 320px;" /></a><br />
<div>Each of us serves as curator of our own locus of cool. It is the starting point for each of our own musical journeys. Something about a chord progression, or a voicing, or a texture, captures our ear. Into the locus of cool it goes&#8230; on display for our contemplation, alongside everything else we've chosen to put there. The importance of selecting each item carefully and cataloguing it faithfully is of supreme importance, as should be obvious. (That's the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in the photo&#8230; someday I hope my own musical "collection" rivals theirs!)<br />
<br />
I often tell people that composers can only write what occurs to us to write&#8230; and a big part of that "occurring" comes from this place. Imagine if Bartók had not traveled to the countryside with Kodály to collect folk songs&#8230; or if Debussy had skipped the 1889 Paris<i> Exposition Universelle</i> and missed hearing the Javanese gamelan music. A primary exhibit in their museum&#8212;missing. A completely different locus of cool, resulting in a different (and, one suspects, lesser) body of work from each.<br />
<br />
We collect ideas from everywhere we can, and then they interact. The museum metaphor falls away, and the "melting pot" metaphor begins. New ideas bubble up to the surface, irrevocably changed by the fire of our artistic inspiration&#8230; but that's a subject for another Provocation, on another Weekend.<br />
<br />
For now: <b>What does your locus of cool sound like?</b> Is it formed by composers like Mahler, Stravinsky, Debussy? Or is it better defined as one part raga, two parts oom-pah band? Or something else entirely?<br />
<br />
What exhibits would we find if we wandered through the space you've curated? What are you doing to expand your collection? I hope every room is already full of wonders and curiosities, and that there's always a hall or two set aside for new discoveries.<br />

<div id='summary3515486923176174866'><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SrpGvw0iy9I/AAAAAAAAAuQ/D4gSXORYQWU/s1600-h/logo_website_136px.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SrpGvw0iy9I/AAAAAAAAAuQ/D4gSXORYQWU/s320/logo_website_136px.jpg" /></a><br />
</div>It has been said that the last ten years have been some of the worst for film music. And while it might be true that since 1999, film music has failed to produce an  indelible theme (some in our industry have argued the case that the last truly "memorable" theme in film music belongs to James Horner's <i>Titanic</i>, released in 1997), film music, like all music, is highly subjective and does not lend itself well to such indictments.<br />
<br />
That being said, there have been over 12,200 studio films released in the USA alone since 1999, and almost all of them had a score. We here at SCOREcast want to know what <i><b>YOU</b></i> think about film music over the last ten years. What have been the most memorable and influential scores that have popped up since 1999? Why were they memorable? What was it about each one that left an impression on you? What sorts of trends or "gimmicks" do you think were born of these scores? Where was the bar <i>raised</i> these last ten years? Where was the ball <i>dropped</i>?<br />
<br />
Now remember &#8212; these are not (necessarily) the BEST scores of the past decade, but instead the ones you feel have had the most influence both on composers and/or listeners. Good or bad, these scores were big in that they defined something memorable and left a mark on the craft after they left theaters to rest for eternity in that big Blockbuster Video in the sky!<br />
<b><br />
Here's What to Do:</b><br />
<i>Go to the COMMENTS section below and tell us what your Top 10 Most Influential Scores of the Past Decade are. Don't be shy... there are no wrong answers, and everyone's will most surely be different. For now, just give us your list, numbered 1 to 10, in no particular order. We will then compile the master list and present our findings to you in a week-long series starting next Tuesday morning.</i><br />
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SrpIm8-276I/AAAAAAAAAuY/a4VOaHWklMQ/s1600-h/posters_of_decade.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SrpIm8-276I/AAAAAAAAAuY/a4VOaHWklMQ/s320/posters_of_decade.jpg" /></a><br />
Along with the master list, we will present commentary and discussion from your favorite SCOREcast columnists featuring discussion on what made these scores so memorable, why they are knocked as much as they are praised, whether they are more known for their accompanying films or for their musical content, the form and function of these scores, as well as much, much more...<br />
<br />
Who better to talk about the greats and gaffes of film music over the last 10 years than those who are daily pursuing the craft? We cannot think of anyone better than our fabulous readers to accomplish this task, so let's hear it!<br />
<br />
Which scores have been <i>your</i> <b><i>Top 10 Most Influential Scores of the Past Decade</i></b>?<br />

<div>In a recent <a href="2009/07/how-to-work-on-multiple-projects-and.html">Scorecast article</a> I wrote that I've never turned composing work down that I honestly believe I have the time and the skills to work on. <br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>That was about 2 months ago, right in the middle of practicing what I preached and jumping in the deep end with my organizational (=juggling) skills.<br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>I was already working on several shows back-to-back with <a href="http://www.slunglow.org/">Slung Low</a>, the awesome experimental theatre company that consistently attempts to push the boundaries of theatre whilst still remaining faithful to the notion of a story, a narrative structure. Fun stuff, and pretty well paid, working with lovely people, playing at very prestigious theatre houses. Ticked all the boxes.<br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>I was also booked in solidly every single weekend and most Fridays to play in a string trio for weddings. Summer's the busiest time for gigs and these were mostly booked in a year in advance. They are quite hard work and tiring, some of them quite far away and involving a lot of time spent travelling, but it's very well paid and the people are, again, really lovely to work with. So this ticks some of the boxes.<br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>I was teaching violin two nights a week too. Not very much mind, only totalling about 4 or 5 hours. This is something I've done for around 7 years now so it was easy work, for ok-ish pay and most of the students worked reasonably hard. One or two boxes ticked, but not high on my list of vocational priorities. The students didn't seem to mind when I cancelled lessons for 2 to 3 weeks at a time to fit around composing, so I reasoned with myself that it was win-win.<br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>But then... da da daaaah! A feature film comes along. A horror, low-but-doable-budget, produced and shot locally. A drama as well. I hadn't done one of those before in feature-length form, a massive box to tick! The pay was very good, the story was fun, the director was a sound chap and we were definitely on the same wavelength when it came to the films and music we liked.  Box ticking all round!<br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>So I took on all this work, and I was hideously well-organised. I even delegated a few small elements of sound design and recording to specialists and other people wanting to get credits and a foot-on-the-ladder of working in film.<br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>But I forgot to factor in any time off. At all. From July through to the beginning of August I worked solidly every day from 9 in the morning til at least 7 at night. Some mornings I started at 7am to fit in all of the composition alongside the playing, teaching and admin tasks. <br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>Truth be told, I've never really had to factor it in time off before this year, it just sort of works itself out. There'll a few days here and there between small projects where I can catch up on household chores, shop, kick back and read, go for walks, visit friends. So why would I need to schedule it in now?<br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>I'm also a bit of a productivity freak. I like to think that my mind and body is essentially a machine: if I eat and drink right, all activities in moderation, keep my vulcan-logical-focussed head on, I can accomplish pretty much any task I've set myself. I don't have kids so don't need to worry about their needs, just me and my boyfriend (who's a writer who keeps the same sort of freelance schedule as me, and is fantastically supportive and helpful when I'm busy busy busy).<br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>But I think I may have pushed it too far. The first sign was where I actually got pretty sick of writing music and started to have fantasies about a 9 til 5, 5 days a week office job. You know. Weekends off, and all that sort of ridiculousness. ;-)<br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>Actually that was a pretty glaring sign that something was up. <br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>I still got the work done. I enjoyed it to a degree when I reminded myself how cool my job was. But it was a conscious effort - not a natural feeling that made me want to jump out of bed as soon as I woke up - to keep that in mind. <br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>The work that I created was actually some of the coolest stuff I've written, but I only see that now looking back on it. At the time I, at moments, became so disenchanted that I couldn't hear whether or not it was right for the cue, never mind good music.<br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>My first day off after this session of busy busy busy was utter bliss. I took the opportunity to think about how my summer was spent. I'd written more music in a short amount of time than I ever had before. I'd several impressive credits to add to the resume. My bank balance looked happier and happier. <br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>But I was absolutely shattered. Bushwacked. Dead-on-my-feet. And I'd developed some hideous RSI in my right hand from click click clicking that mouse all day long.<br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>Something not quite right here.<br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>A long hard look at my work commitments compared with my life priorities saw a few glaring clashes. Everything I do must lead to me writing music for a living. It's the only job I'm ever completely happy and confident in. It's the only career I can ever imagine doing in the long haul. <br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>Which led in turn to a few tricky decisions. The first one was to quit teaching. <br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>Though this wasn't, surprisingly, as difficult as I first imagined it would be. Every student was happy for me, and also pleased that I'd found them alternative tuition that would be more consistent than they'd been getting all year from me. The teachers that I passed them onto all love teaching and it's very much a vocation for them. All very amicable - score!<br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>As has been said on here many times, film music scoring is a collaborative business, and if you're going to make it, you'll be doing it with the help of many people behind the scenes. I'm slowly but surely assembling a team of skilled freelance sound recordists, editors and designers - that really enjoy their work, and that the credits are useful to - that I can trust to take on those tasks when I've gotta get my head down on the score. <br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>I'm also looking into making relationships with orchestrators, bigger recording facilities and contractors along with specialist instrumentalists, so that when it gets hectic again that team is ready in place and ready to go!<br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>There are a couple of other decisions that I'll have to deal with eventually, but I'm going to take them very gradually... for the sake of my own nerves if anything. :-)<br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>I'm also attempting an experiment: to schedule 1 day off a week for recovery, fun and 'sharpening the saw'. Even that's tricky at the moment, and I'm just about managing 1 day every 2 or 3 weeks at this rate. But it's still a step in the right direction and it's really making a difference. <br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>It's not easy also because this default work habit is so utterly ingrained in every fibre of my being. I'm still scoring two more awesome shows with Slung Low and playing with the trio. I think there are some other people that I work with on a regular basis who are quite surprised by this paradigm shift in my priorities, and I'm sensing that it may pee off a few of my colleagues. I can understand their point of view! <br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>But as the one living in my skin I will apologise and, like I attempted with my violin students, hope to make the transition to a new worklife balance as easy and smooth as possible for everyone involved...<br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>And hopefully, this way, when another one of these fantastic opportunities comes a-knocking, I'll have a system and a schedule in place that is free and flexible enough to fit it in comfortably and realistically, not bulging out at the seams.<br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>Or am I being naively unrealistic? <br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>Is what I am trying to achieve beyond the grasp of the jobbing composer simply by the nature of the beast? <br />
</div><div><br />
</div><div>Crikey. Hope not. ;-)<br />

(Insert picture of smiling Score Engineer, like the one in my mirror.) As any specialist, he or she would bring a wealth of knowledge and experience that would make your life easier and your score sound better and more competitive.<br />
<br />
But - - welcome to the real world - - I realize it doesn't always work out that way. For reasons of budget and expediency a composer is often called on to record, mix, and submit a finished score on his or her own. As each composer must own the computers and other technical equipment that make our modern music business possible, it's advantageous to know what to do when you need to, so that you can fend for yourself and compete.<br />
<br />
For a dozen years I taught a class at UCLA Extension, in the Film Scoring program, called "Staying in Sync". It started out being the "time code class" but evolved over the years to being all about digital audio, synchronization and timing issues, and miscellaneous studio tips for composers.<br />
<br />
Here are some guidelines, in two categories. For those of you with a bit more experience this may serve as a review, and for others, a good starting checklist.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Sample rate and bit depth</span><br />
<br />
This topic needs to start with a discussion of delivery requirements. In every score project that you are ask to do, there will be specific technical requirements for the format for music delivery. You need to find out what those are from your client; don't just go with "what ever you usually do".<br />
<br />
Most film and television scores are delivered at a sample rate of 48KHz, at bit depth of 24-bit. This is in contrast to music CD work, which has a sample rate of 44.1K at 16 bit. But, don't just assume - - ask. Most software can do conversions between all the common sample rates and bit depths, but your product will sound better if you start out in the format of delivery.<br />
<br />
I still sometimes hear, 48K sounds better than 44.1. This is a myth that got its start in the early days of digital audio. In the technology of digital audio the difference would theoretically amount to less than one-third octave above 20KHz (beyond the top end of human hearing). In reality today's digital interfaces often have the same filtering for the two sample rates. However, what does make things sound (a bit) worse, and is a pain in the kiester besides, is sample rate conversion. Who wants to change all those files when you are finally finished and up against your deadline? Just go with the specified rate.<br />
<br />
There is one exception to this that isn't really an exception at all. Besides delivering the score, everyone wants good sounding recordings for the "demo reel CD". For this you will have to do sample and bit rate conversion, to 44.1-16. Just use the highest quality conversion setting available in your software and it will be fine. You can do this after the deadline has passed and you have some spare time.<br />
<br />
What about the high sample rates that some software and hardware supports these days - - 88.1, 96, 176.2, 192? In some cases that may be worth it to a small degree, such as extremely high fidelity orchestral recording. But bear in mind that some aspects of your system may not be compatible with those rates, such as software synths, and you will still have to do a conversion before delivery. Plus, recording at higher rates will consume a ton of hard drive space, like filling a bathtub with a fire hose.<br />
<br />
Now for bit depth. 24-bit has become industry standard, superceding 16-bit. You should definitely go with 24-bit. Just set everything that way and leave it. Why? In a nutshell, digital audio becomes cleaner (less distortion) the louder you record, up to 0, where the red light comes on - - whoops, distortion, "sorry, you played great but can we get that once again please?" 24-bit has a wider "sweet spot" where it sounds good, so you don't have to have everything quite so loud. Also, mixing "in the box", plugins, etc. all sound better at 24-bit. If your delivery requirements are 16-bit for mixes, make the conversion at the end and you will still have good sound.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Time code</span><br />
<br />
SMPTE time code used to be a complicated big deal - - I taught a whole six-week class on it. Fortunately things have gotten a lot simpler these days.<br />
<br />
Let's review: time code is basically a way of numbering the frames of a film, video, or audio recording. It gives you location information, and allows video and audio to be synchronized together. There are several different formats of time code, based on the number of frames per second of a particular video format, i.e. film or television. Our audio software can work with any type time code, but has to be manually set to the same format as your video.<br />
<br />
For a score project, you will typically be supplied with a Quicktime video file, and (you may have to specify this) it should have on the picture a visible box with time code numbers (sometimes called visual time code or window burn). (Linear time code on an audio channel is unnecessary.) It's customary for the first frame of program picture (not including leader) to be at a time code address of eight frames past 01:00:00:00. The numbers should start ten or more seconds before that, to allow for a preroll, although the software doesn't really need it. Sometimes the start mark will be in the neighborhood of 2 hours, or greater, such as in a film score that has more than one reel. However, the time code should never start with 00:00:00:00. The very first frame of the video should start with "rolling" numbers, that is, no frozen frame members and then starting after a few seconds. Time code should be continuous and never stop or skip. If (horrors!) they re-cut the video they will have to generate new time code, but the very first frame of program should be the same number it was before.<br />
<br />
The frame format and numbering decisions will usually be made by a post-production supervisor or video/film editor, who will use the editing software to stripe continuous time code numbers on the frames. Hopefully they will tell you what the time code format is, or in Quicktime software you can use the "Movie Inspector" under the Windows menu. Make sure your software is set to match.<br />
<br />
Besides the various frame rates, there is the issue of drop frame. Two of the most common time code formats are 29.97 drop frame and 29.97 non drop frame. Explaining the distinction between those two would be a fine cure for insomnia, but suffice to say they are not the same; again, find out what format is on your video and set the software or machine to match.<br />
<br />
I should also mention that there's a new format of time code, 23.976, which is there to accommodate new HD video formats. I know that Digital Performer 6 can work with those, but DP5 cannot - - you may have to upgrade.<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SrWl7dM0OQI/AAAAAAAAALI/l5o1e0v8BU4/s1600-h/DP+Time+code+menu-2e2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SrWl7dM0OQI/AAAAAAAAALI/l5o1e0v8BU4/s320/DP+Time+code+menu-2e2.jpg" /></a><br />
</div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Frame rate menu in Digital Performer 6</span></span><br />
</div><br />
Once the video is imported into your composing software there are two steps: first you must set the software so that its time code numbers equal what is on the video screen.  In Pro Tools this is called "spotting"; in DP it is "set movie start".  Other apps have similar settings. Make the numbers match the very first number in the video. Then, second, set bar 1 beat 1 of your cue to the time code number in which you want it to start.<br />
<br />
In a professional organization of which I'm a member, another score mixer sent out promos for a seminar in which he was going to teach composers what they needed to know about score engineering. I'm sure he had many wise things to say, but my eye was caught by his assertion that "there is a particular time code format that every composer should insist on". In case this has caused any misconceptions, let me clear this up - - under no circumstances that I have ever seen did a composer have the choice of what type of time code will be used. Someone else makes that choice. It's no big deal - - just find out what type is being used.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">More to come</span><br />
I've got some things to say about score mixing, both technical and "artistic", but looks like this is about enough for this time. I want to cover some things about plug-ins, and of course I won't forget "stems mixing", so check back with me for Part 2.</div>

</div><b><i>"How much money will I make as a film composer?"</i></b><br />
<br />
That's the six million dollar question, isn't it? I get this question from aspiring composers more than any other, and I never know what to say. As much as I try to come up with a cool, suave answer to their query, all I can usually muster is something like "Whatever you can!"<br />
<br />
Lame and disappointing? Yes. Honest and truthful? Absolutely.<br />
<br />
The bigger question &#8212; and the one I want to tackle here &#8212; is "How much money do live players eat up during a film score's production and how do you plan for the bloodshed?" The answer to that questions is... "I wish there was an answer." The fact is that it really depends on a load of different variables, but I'll try to define some of them here for you to help get you thinking about how you should budget your up-fronts to "pay" for your score. But first, let's start with the customary "definables":<br />
I'm assuming that:<br />
<br />
<b>1) You prefer quality.</b> I'm not a believer in skimping or cutting corners. Every score I have ever written has contained live elements of some sort. Whether I was able to hire <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richie_Sambora" rel="wikipedia" title="Richie Sambora">Richie Sambora</a> to play guitar for me on a TV show or if I  record timpani in my studio on my own, the fact is that I made a deal with myself early on that I would go <u><i>live</i></u> whenever I possibly could &#8212; and I have. A live performance, even if it isn't the <i>best</i> live performance, still does miracles for a recorded score that samples simply cannot achieve.<br />
<br />
I am willing to pay for union musicians to come in and perform on my work for a couple of reasons. First, LA players are simply the best in the world. They  make everything sound better. Additionally, I like having my toes in the player pool around LA because then when I get to hire a full ensemble, pending availability,  I'm more likely to get who I want because of our  relationship and work history together. <br />
<br />
<b>2) Your score will accommodate live players.</b> If the score to your project calls for a <i>band</i> consisting of piano, synth pads, mouth percussion, and Indonesian finger cymbals (I once scored a short film with this line-up, believe it or not!), then you are probably not going to need any live players. Piano samples are good enough nowadays that you can get away with   Synthogy Ivory or NI Akoustik Piano o something. Anything to keep from spending that  $500 to get the ol' Blüthner tuned up, right? It is really the scores that require orchestral instrumentation of some sort that we are referring to here.<br />
<br />
<b>3) You have <u><i>some</i></u> budget.</b> You cannot start with zero. I mean, <i>technically you can</i>, but it's not going to be fun for you. To make money, you need to spend some money. Your score will not sound very good if you have no money to put into it. I say this for two reasons, the first one being somewhat obvious, and the second... not so much. First, no money into a score means that the score will be all sampled (Refer to point number 1 above!). Secondly, no money <u><i>into</i></u> a score means no money <u><i>out</i></u> of a score for you, and how much do you think *that* scenario is going to motivate you to do your best work? The principals withholding budget from their composer is both a sign of bad planning on their part as well as an assumption of lesser value on your product  and it's ability to service their film. Not a good combo.<br />
<br />
Try and get your director or producer to find you some money.  Anything. Anything that will give you some kind of reward for scoring this thing. If they can pay you in widgets, then take the widgets and sell them for some money to hire live players.<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>The Package Deal</b><br />
</div>Back in the good old days, composers were given a creative fee to write the score and then the studio paid for the rest of the expenses. Studios had musicans on staff that were just there all day and if you needed them, you ran out to the stage and recorded something reallty quick. If not, they all just sat there all day hoping you came out to visit. Obviously, this became very silly very quickly, and with emerging technology and the composer's ability to synthesize a majority of the score at home, "the package deal" became popular.<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div>A <i>package deal</i> is when the production gives you all of the money that they have budgeted for music and you are then responsible to hire all of the people necessary to bring that score in on-time and on budget, while hopefully maintaining a decent creative fee out of whatever is left after everything is paid for. As you can imagine, it can be tough, if not impossible, to keep any of this money, depending n what the producers "say" they want out of the score. If they give you 12k as your music budget, and they want "live orchestra", good luck. You might be able to augment your samples with a smattering of live players, but there will not be anything left after you are done to feed your family with. You either need to negotiate a higher package, have something else going on while you score that film that will supplement your income, or leave the deal on the table and walk away. Those are you options.<br />
<br />
<b>The Music Budget</b><br />
So, let's assume that you have some money to play with and that you are excited to get started scoring this new film that you've just been assigned.<br />
Let's also say that this film is at the very bottom of what most independent (and by "independent", I mean truly <u><i>independent</i></u> ... of a <i>studio</i>, that is) films are budgeting for music these days: <i><b>$34,000</b></i>. That is actually where you should be if you are hired onto a low-end indie feature. In fact, if you get *this* much, pat yourself on the back. You are lucky. Unfortunately, it should be higher, but it rarely is.<br />
<br />
If you're not used to working with a budget of this magnitude before, it <i>looks</i> like a ton of dough at first glance. But in this gig, things add up and it starts to get complicated quickly. Ready to see where it all goes, and how fast? Grab your tissue box... Let's do this!<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SrdUOIFWPFI/AAAAAAAAAM4/4RSsrFRc6XY/s1600-h/Picture+6.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SrdUOIFWPFI/AAAAAAAAAM4/4RSsrFRc6XY/s400/Picture+6.png" /></a><br />
</div><br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">In a typical "package deal" scoring agreement, the composer would get paid in thirds &#8212; one-third of the total budget upon attachment to the project, one-third upon commencement of scoring, and the final third when you deliver the score. This will work fine with our budget since by the time we are ready to record any orchestra, we'll already have been paid twice, to the tune of $17k. Cha-Ching! If we stay disciplined and stick to our Hard Expenses budget of $15,900, we'll have $1,100 left over to apply to the rest of our expenses later on. Then if we come in at least under budget with our Soft Expenses, we'll make a nice little $14,955 when all is said and done. Additionally, if we can somehow trim a bit out of our Soft Expenses, then we can probably get that number up to around $16k. That's not a <i>horrible</i> profit on a film that budgeted 34k to begin with. It's not a ton of dough, but for an entry level indie flick, it's a nice shot in the arm to start out your career.<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>Hard Expenses</b><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">For the sake of our discussion here, I'm going to refer to the things that are absolutely non-negotiable &#8212; in other words, "you NEED them" &#8212;  as <i>hard expenses</i>. These would be expenses such as musicians, a place to record them (scoring stage or recording studio), an engineer to run those sessions for you, a contractor to get you the players, etc. If you are in a time crunch and/or you cannot do it all yourself, you can also toss an orchestrator into the mix along with an assistant to help you carve audio stems when you get down to delivery time and things start to get tense.<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><u><i>Musicians </i></u><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/Src7f1lvX9I/AAAAAAAAAMo/US_IFJQrdcE/s1600-h/Picture+1.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/Src7f1lvX9I/AAAAAAAAAMo/US_IFJQrdcE/s320/Picture+1.png" /></a>Using the example of some of the films I've scored with budgets like these, I'm going to say that a 20-piece union string section is going to run you about 10k for a single three hour session. As you can see from the graph on the right, the orchestra will be our biggest expense, and for good reason. We are not going to skimp on our players. These are the greatest players in the world, and they are going to basically dress up a lot of what would otherwise be lacking because of our small budget. I've used LA players on short film budgets that were a fraction of what this one is, and the scores sound like something out of a major studio tent-pole film, so... our musicians get top dollar. No arguments.<br />
<br />
Now, you *can* get a better rate if you were to consider recording in another part of the world like eastern Europe or even Russia, but I would use the word <u><i>better</i></u> very carefully here. "Better" doesn't necessarily always mean "better sounding". I've recorded in places where you are wise to schedule all of the tough cues toward the start of the day or you run the risk of musicians heading to the pub at lunch and coming back tipsy. Not a great deal for your afternoon sessions! You also have to account for the fact that if you are recording here in town, you are getting up everyday from your place across town and maybe driving 30 minutes to record. Translation: No Overhead. If you are oversees, you have to pay hotel expenses, airfare (roundtrip to Bratislava is running around $1,300 right now), food, and customary travel expenses.<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">That being said, it pays to research the crap out of your "oversees" session possibilities before you take the leap. People don't realize it, but over the last ten years or so the <a href="http://www.afm.org/">American Federation of Musicians</a> (or "AFM", the musicians' union) has made it as easy as ever to record an orchestra in LA or New York, having created a new fee schedule that will accommodate virtually any film production no matter how big or small the music budget. They even have a "demo scale" which is just what it wounds like: a reduced scale for those times that you'd like to have a live orchestra on your... wait for it... DEMO. Wouldn't *that* be kick ass?<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SrdF3nq7FiI/AAAAAAAAAMw/k_ZU6VQ8euk/s1600-h/Picture+2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><br />
</a><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SrdF3nq7FiI/AAAAAAAAAMw/k_ZU6VQ8euk/s1600-h/Picture+2.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SrdF3nq7FiI/AAAAAAAAAMw/k_ZU6VQ8euk/s400/Picture+2.png" /></a>For a group of more than 35 players, union  rates are currently at $262 per player per session. If you require fewer players, the rates go up from there (see table for single session rates). Don't forget that you'll need to pay your contractor (also known sometimes as an "orchestra manager"), which is the person that puts your orchestra together for you. They make double scale, which is simply twice the standard musicians' rate of pay. So in our case, since we are using only 20 players, our player rate will be about $300 per player/session. Then, you add the contractor to that at double scale, which is $600, bringing you to a total player cost of $6,600.<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Sweet! We budgeted 10k for players, so this means we are already way under budget! Not so fast, Johnson!<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><i><u>Doubling</u></i><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">You are having one of your violinists and one of your cellists play solos on two of your cues. You are also asking one of your players "double" on another instrument. <i>Doubling</i> usually applies mainly to woodwind or brass players (a flutist also playing piccolo, or a trumpet player also playing flugelhorn). Piano players aren't considered doublists if you also need them on celesta. Naturally, musicians aren't going to double for free. For these special skills, they receive additional pay.<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><i><u>Cartage</u></i><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">We also have two (2) double basses in our line-up. That means that we also will be taking care of their <i>cartage</i> fees. "Cartage" is the cost of getting a larger, less manageable instruments to and from the recording venue. Cartage fees always apply to double bass, tuba, cello, percussion (tympani, bass drum, etc.), baritone sax, bass sax, contra-bass clarinet, contra bassoon, accordion, baritone horn, and contra bass trombone. AFM states that cartage on one single double bass is about $12 per session, but in LA, cartage fees are often billed at a higher rate than AFM projections, so we'll add in $200 for today's bassists. Take it from <i>this</i> drummer... those are real-world figures. My going rate for cartage on my percussion arsenal is $125 a day.<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">As you can see, it starts adding up fast, and when all is said and done, we are looking at about $10,000 to get everybody paid and taken care of for a standard 3-hour session.<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">There are so many factors that go into accounting your  budget for players. How much music do you need to record? How many players will record it? Are there any doubles? Are there any soloists? Does the *whole* band need to be there for all of the sessions, or can you record with everyone the bigger cues and then start cutting players as you scale down the score to the more intimate cues? How much cartage is involved?<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Be smart. Use the schedule to your advantage. Don't be stupid about what you <i>can</i> and <i>cannot</i> get away with using samples &#8212; if you can record it, then <i>record</i> it! Don't be afraid to ask questions... there aren't any dumb questions, and if there are... JUST BE WILLING TO LOOK DUMB! Who gives a crap! You won't give one either after you are hit with your first meal penalty because you didn't ask questions!<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Use your people... your concertmaster, your union rep. Talk to your players... go out on the floor and shake hands with them. Be genuine and thank them for playing and being who they are. Use your contractor... your contractor can either be your best friend or your worst nightmare. They are there to help you, but ultimately, their job is to protect those union musicians. They have the power to shut down your session if you are abusing musicians by not following the rules.<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The bottom line with players is this: Everybody is working for <u><i>you</i></u>. You call the shots, and as long as you do follow union guidelines, you are free to pretty much do whatever you want to do. Live session pplayers will make your little 34k score sound like a 100k score. I'm not lying.<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><u><i>Recording Venue</i></u><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The next expenditure that we'll need to shell out some good money for is the venue in which we'll record the score. Under normal circumstances (read: a larger budget), we would contact a stage here in town like Warners, Fox, or Sony (Eastwood Scoring Stage, Newman Scoring Stage, or the Barbara Streisand Scoring Stage, respectively) to record our full-sized orchestra. But since we are working with a smaller group this time out &#8212;  20 string players, to be exact &#8212; we'll save some money here and record in one of the many excellent recording studios here in Los Angeles that are known for getting a solid sound with a smaller ensemble. Rooms like Westlake Audio's Studio "D", Capitol "A", Henson's big room, or Glenwood Place in Burbank are all perfect for this size of group, and they are also all known for getting a great string sound.<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">For three-hour sessions, you can expect to pay between $800 on the low end to approximately $1,500 or even $2,000 on the high end for one of these rooms. Scoring stages are considerably more, but again, you won't need one unless you are scoring a studio feature with a large music budget. If you are, then that discussion is beyond the scope of this article. We'll save that one for next time!<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">We are going to go with a place that quoted $1,200 for a 3-hour session. With that fee of $1,200, you'll get a lot of stuff. First, and most obviously, the room - complete with all of the booth gear, the big recording console, and the lounge facilities of the studio. The studio's piano is going to cost extra, but since we are using the Ivory plug-in,  we won't be needing that, so money saved there. For our rental of the studio, we also get use of all of the studio's microphones, although your engineer will most likely bring their own tried and tested set-up. Just let them, believe me. They know what they are doing.<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><u><i>The Engineer</i></u><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Speaking of which, almost always you'll want to differ to your engineer as to which room you should use in the first place. Nobody knows the attributes and nuances of stages and rooms better than your recording engineer. In fact, that is part of the reputation of a great recordist - their ears are tuned to the point that they understand and are aware of the places to get the best recordings, given the specifics of your project.<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The engineer might be the single most important piece of the puzzle to getting a great film score sound, so bargain-shopping for one is not something I would recommend doing. Expect to pay between $800 to $2000 per three-hour session for a great engineer. This might seem like a lot of money, but I assure you, they earn every penny. You won't know this until your first time out with a good engineer, but they are working far beyond that three hours of recording time. They arrive to your session hours ahead of even you (sometimes even the day before) to set-up microphones and place music stands and seats, insuring that you have plenty of separation between instrument groups. Many times, the engineer will work with an assistant (usually the salaried assistant at the studio you are recording at), and will put this person to work running cable and positioning microphone stands. The fee for the engineering assistant is often included in the studio rental fee. If it isn't, ask if the studio is willing to roll the assistant's fee into the cost of the rental. Most places will.<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">One last thing about  engineers &#8212; when you find a great engineer that you work well with, stick with them. Bring them with you on all of your jobs. Repeated work with that person will lead to the two of you being able to finish each others' musical sentences, and that is a luxury when things are tense in the control booth that you'll appreciate down the road. For years, Tom Geron was my engineer. Lately, as Tom has taken on more and more work as an engineer for pop radio studio sessions, I've switched engineers and now use Michael Arvold. On my orchestral sessions for "The Way Home",  we had a ProTools melt-down that seemed at first to be pretty monumental. As I sat there hyper-ventilating,  Michael was able to fix the problem in a few minutes, saving us from wasting precious time and money with all the musicians  staring at us through the glass. These are the times when history with a solid engineer is priceless.<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><u><i>Orchestrator</i></u><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I'll be brief with this one, and I'll abstain from starting a flame war as to whether or not orchestrators are important to the process. For the purposes of our example here, I budgeted one in at $900. Orchestrators typically work on a <i>"page rate</i>" &#8212; a certain amount of dollars for one page of orchestrated score. A common misconception among newer composers is that orchestrators and copyists are one in the same. Not true. An orchestrator *can* also copy if that is the arrangement, but they are not automatically expected to do so. Copying is normally considered a separate line item from orchestration.<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Most composers are used to paying orchestrators &#177;$90 per page of finished score. This is a general guideline, however, as I've paid less than that and more at times, depending on who the orchestrator was and what the demand was for that orchestrator's particular brand of orchestration. You can see how this will add up when you consider that a page of score is typically four measures long for a full group of players. However, for our little 20-piece string section, we can probably have the orchestrator get most of it on two or three pages for each instrument group. This however, has little or no bearing on how much they will charge. Just because they can squeeze everything on one page doesn't mean their page rate now goes down (a common misconception).<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><i><u>Conductor</u></i><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I'm going to assume, since this is a little string date, that you are going to conduct your string players yourself. You may choose not to do this, either because your director will be there and you are nervous leaving them alone in the booth, or because you simply aren't an experienced conductor. Either is fine and you shouldn't be ashamed of those reasons for staying in the booth and hiring this role out to someone who can handle it for you. On the other hand, I heartily recommend you conducting your scores at least every once in a while. It is good practice, and it also just makes for a different kind of session. There is nothing quite like conducting players to a piece of music you have written. Often, you can evoke more emotion out of a group that you are conducting yourself, simply because the players see and feel your emotion behind your own music.<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Many orchestrators also conduct. SCOREcast's Brian Satterwhite orchestrated and conducted a string date for me recently and we had a great week together here in LA. Brian's talents as a seasoned conductor enabled me to stay focused on the sound of the score with my director and manage the sessions from within the booth.<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>Soft Expenses</b><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Our "soft expenses" are going to be things that would be great to have, but are not absolutely necessary. I usually try and include these things when I budget out a job, but that's just me. You can do what you want... I've just found that putting these things in the budget allows me to keep everything related to the project in my business accounting and separate from my personal accounting. With this method, I keep the little things that add up over time (Starbucks with the director, valet fees at the premiere, etc.) from going on a personal credit card for convenience sake. It's not so convenient on April 15th when my accountant shows me that I accidentally paid for our plane tickets to the premiere in San Francisco with my personal Visa card!<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><u><i>Studio Upgrade</i></u><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SrdXNBRde4I/AAAAAAAAANA/wpHlwV3kycg/s1600-h/Picture+4.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SrdXNBRde4I/AAAAAAAAANA/wpHlwV3kycg/s400/Picture+4.png" /></a>I've included this here to illustrate a point more than anything: If I had a nickel for all of the times I've been told by an aspiring composer "As soon as I get my first payment from them, I'm going to upgrade my studio so I'm ready to roll!"... well... I'd be a very rich man. "Getting your first gig" is NOT the time to make sure you are technologically ready to start scoring films. You need to have that all ironed out ahead of time. <br />
</div><br />
Here's why:<br />
If you are prepared for this gig, and you have done our homework early instead of waiting until you have the gig to do it, this entire catagory of expenses becomes pure profit. Said another way... That's cold hard cash straight into your bank account! It's a harsh awakening to start out a project having to hand over a major portion of your potential profits to a place like Guitar Center. Blech! That's a soul-sucking event if there ever was one!<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Do the due diligence of getting your rig up to snuff before you sign a project. Trust me... you'd rather hit the ground running with a rig that works than have your head in manuals for the first two weeks of your scoring schedule.<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><i><u>Filmmaker Meetings/Meals/Gas/Auto</u></i><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I know what you are thinking... "Deane... seriously? Really?". Yes. I. Do.<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I ABSOLUTELY figure in my meetings at Starbucks or at dinner with my clients, as well as the automotive expenses to make them all happen. Why not? If not for those meetings, I would satisfied to eat at home like any other night of my life. This is a necessary expense that I have to incur in order to cavort with and schmooze my clients, so yes... I take it out of the budget.<br />
</div><br />
End of story.<i><u><br />
<br />
Studio Lease/Power/Materials</u></i><br />
These three things are expenditures that I will incur to keep the lights on in my studio while I work on this project. All three come right out of the budget.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SrdcvAgsASI/AAAAAAAAANI/tr172ZRBNAU/s1600-h/Picture+3.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SrdcvAgsASI/AAAAAAAAANI/tr172ZRBNAU/s320/Picture+3.png" /></a>Some of the best advice I have ever heard was from my high school economics teacher, Ron Sather. He said <i>"</i>Your family budget should never absorb any of your business budget liabilities."<br />
<br />
If you have your studio in your home, I hope to all that's holy that you are taking a tax deduction on the square footage of your studio space. The IRS allows for that and you should be taking advantage. Additionally, do not put your power, space, and materials expenses (CD cases, printer paper, pens/pencils, ink, USB cables, etc.) on the shoulders of your family or personal budget. Everything should be kept separate so that at tax time you are able to get the maximum deduction, saving you boatloads of dough.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Takeaways</b><br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I hope this has been helpful. I know it is sort of hard to envision a fake budget when there really is no hard data to go on, but I'm sure you get my point. What I really think is important for any of you to take away from this article, it's this: The reward of scoring films is mostly an emotional/spiritual/psychological one. There is not that much money in the craft, if you really boil down the expenses. Even the top 12 guys that are scoring all of the tent-pole studio features in Hollywood right now... when you add up their expenditures and their work hours, their <a href="2009/09/weekend-provocation-music-time-money.html">YACC</a> is not what you might think it is. Jerry Goldsmith once said, "If you don't like it for the love of it, you'll hate it for the hurt of it."<br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">If it is true that financial pressure is the #1 cause of broken families in America, you can only imagine what it can do to you as a businessperson. Get yourself together and do some hardcore, pencil-sharpening work on your budget outlines for your projects before you trun them in. It is so worth all of the footwork, and this gig will be a hell of a lot more profitable for you if you do.<br />
</div><br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>What Do <u><i>You</i></u> Think?</b><br />
</div>I realize that I left out a TON of information in this article, and honestly, this topic is ginormous - I could talk about it with you for three days and we still wouldn't cover it all. I'm committed to being on the COMMENTS this week like never before to answer any questions anyone might have about budgets... and here is my pledge: <u><i>NOTHING IS OFF LIMITS</i></u>. Ask away. If I can't give you and answer, I'll find someone who can.<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Let's talk about this budgeting thing and see if we can't wrap our heads around it a little bit more together!!!<br />

</div>Hey SCOREcasters!<br />
<br />
Just jumping on here real quick tonight to congratulate my friend, SCOREcast's very own Lee Sanders - composer of CBS' "The Amazing Race". "Race" won an <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Award" rel="wikipedia" title="Emmy Award">Emmy</a> award tonight as Best Reality Competition for the seventh straight year.<br />
<br />

In each class there were bright, diligent students who just couldn't find the right turn of phrase. You could feel the mental flailing-about in every paragraph&#8230; they were struggling in vain to get to the point.<div>My technique for attacking the problem was simple: First, I'd listen to the students talk about the parts that were troubling them. Then, once they were in the mode of talking with me, rather than wrestling with the problem, I'd ask what it was they <i>wanted </i>to say. Just offhand, like we were having a normal conversation and I was asking what they were planning to have for lunch.<div>It was shocking (the first few times I tried this, anyway) how this question broke through the students' guard and solved the problem. Most times they'd give me a concise, clearly-worded statement in reply.

<div id='summary2340889421395906007'><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fZp_xxfyktg/SqqPMWPkOCI/AAAAAAAAACA/uiOmbW_rWGA/s1600-h/meghan-laundry.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fZp_xxfyktg/SqqPMWPkOCI/AAAAAAAAACA/uiOmbW_rWGA/s320/meghan-laundry.png" /></a></div>Last time, in this space, I walked you through some of the scenarios I've seen as a composer's assistant, and how I've either learned from them or eschewed them as personal practices in my own, short, career. Let's look at a few more in light of this month's theme of Budgeting and Scheduling.<br />
<br />
<b>Budgeting</b><br />
It seems the higher up the food chain you go in the film music world, budgeting for recording sessions gets more involved and a lot harder. In fact, I would say that the more legit your recording session is, the tougher it is to pay for. An example would be a union scale production. If you are working on an independent film where YOU are the orchestrator, the copyist, the contractor, and ultimately the player, then it becomes quite clear how the music budget should be planned because YOU are the only one getting paid. However, on a studio budgeted film where there are hundreds of thousands &#8212; if not millions &#8212; of dollars to be played with, there is obviously a lot more to consider.<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/file_thumbview_approve/4146593/2/istockphoto_4146593-stack-of-cash.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="158" src="http://www.istockphoto.com/file_thumbview_approve/4146593/2/istockphoto_4146593-stack-of-cash.jpg" width="200" /></a></div>Hiring union musicians can cost you anywhere from $261 to $315 per player, per hour... depending on if you are overdubbing or not, but you also have to figure in your concertmaster and your contractor (they make double scale), cartage fees, studio assistants, room costs, engineers, ProTools operators, specialty musicians (The George Doering's of the world), and whatever else your score needs to get recorded. Room costs are very important to consider, because if you are recording a 60-piece group you are going to need a stage versus a "record room" (a studio typically set up to record smaller orchestras for rock and pop performances) that will better accommodate an orchestra &#8212; the latter of which will cost you considerably less.<br />
<br />
A couple of years ago, I was assisting a composer who had been handed his first major studio assignment. I was only doing production work on source material for the film, but I was close enough to see some of the ins and outs that this guy had to go through as a fairly new player in the game. It was interesting, to say the least, but the biggest thing I learned while on that job was that, for whatever reason, this composer had no idea of how to budget for musicians. You would know the name of the movie if I told you what it was, so we aren't talking about a little independent flick here. No, this was a full-fleged studio film in the 170 million overall budget range (and that's just what was reported publicly).<br />
<br />
About three weeks before the delivery deadline, after all of the orchestral sessions and pre-records were in the can, the composer realized that he had not budgeted enough money for an adequate final mix of the score. He was about $30,000 short. Everyone on our team of six went to work calling in favors and figuring out how we could divide up the mix in hopes of getting it done, handed in on time and under budget. After we all spent the last week of production with zero sleep and a constant ringing in our ears because of no breaks, the score was finally delivered. Needless to say, it was a rough final week.<br />
<br />
I remember being so excited to go see the film in the theater. That score was hard work and we all were looking forward to premiere night. As the opening scene whizzed by, another assistant on the team leaned over to me, jaw on the ground, and whispered, "Thank God for the effects or we'd be thrown out of this theater." The mix was atrocious. Absolutely unlistenable. And now, when I am at someone's home and their children are watching the film on BluRay or DVD, I can hear each painful note coming through loud and... distorted.<br />
<br />
<b>Schedules</b><br />
Isn't it always the schedule that kills ya? In my experience, the best composers spend as much time writing music as they can, and as little time screwing with computers as they can. It really is *that* simple! The schedule is the schedule is the schedule. It is what it is. There's often no changing it, no making it better. With that in mind, write! Spend every minute you have writing. Forget tweaking sounds or getting the computer to respond quicker, or cleaning your studio. (By the way &#8212; if you are one of those people who say "I cannot function in a cluttered studio", then you have clearly never worked on a studio feature! I haven't been in a studio production hub yet that didn't look like a Level 5 hurricane swept through it!)<br />
<br />
And before we go any further, let me clarify something: <br />
<br />
<blockquote>"Writing" does <i>NOT</i> mean:<br />
<br />
<b>&#183; Sequencing mock-ups.</b> This can be hired out and it is well worth the expense when you consider how long it takes to accomplish. Ask yourself how many man-hours you spent on your last project sequencing the MIDI versus how much you actually spent fleshing out a lush score for the film? (Go ahead... I'll give you a minute or two to cry like an old granny.)&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote><b>&#183; Upgrading studio gear.</b> This, too, can be hired out at best... OR... at worst, done during "dark" time when you are so exhausted from writing that you just can't write another note today.<br />
<br />
<b>&#183; Face time.</b> And by this, I mean with your principals. While this is not something you should hire out, it is important to educate your directors and producers early to the fact that the more time they want to sit and bullshit about how great John Williams is, the more time they are going to need to allot you to make their score great as well. Sometimes, creative people think they are the only ones that need space and solitude to create. It's weird, but it's true.</blockquote><br />
On sequencing, most composers I've worked for have people in their studios that do all of that for them. Chill out! They oversee it ALL, so nobody is ghosting or taking liberties with lead lines and harmonies. But what *is* happening is the composer is able to multiply himself/herself in such a way that all of this work gets done and the project stays on schedule. I know composers whose studios run 24/7. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004581/">Harry Gregson-Williams</a>, for one, has a crew come in when the "day crew" leaves so that production can run throughout the night - like a musical 7 Eleven!<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.viev.com/images/vievstock/scheduling_solutions_small_355048.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="150" src="http://www.viev.com/images/vievstock/scheduling_solutions_small_355048.jpg" width="200" /></a></div>Look, you can talk about it however you want to talk about it and you can have whatever view on it you want to have, but I'll tell you straight up how it is: Big-budget studio films do not get done with one guy anymore. It just doesn't happen. This business is a business of <i><u>teams</u></i> - and it has nothing to do with the talent of the composer, whether he is lacking or she is amazing. It has to do with the schedules imposed by the studios to get these things finished on time and without overrun. <br />
<br />
And it's only going to get worse. The music team's technology used to be the leader in the movie-making industry. We used to have the coolest toys. That's not necessarily true anymore. Special effects digitization, motion-capture technology, and CGI animation has eclipsed the coolness factor of any music-related software that is out there, and in turn, has created ever shorter schedules and timeframes for getting things done in post-production. Like it or not, we *have* to keep up with that - and so we find whatever way we can to cope. One of my mentors last year at school said, "More dotties equals more bodies!"<br />
<br />
<b>Creative Finance</b><br />
One last thing on money: Use it as a tool. Too many composers who are just starting out think of money as a "consumable resource" instead of a "tool". Just because you are being paid from one job this month doesn't mean that you need to use it to go on vacation next month. Instead, use it to pay for a little bit better group of musicians on next month's gig. Further your career with whatever money you make. <br />
<br />
When I was working this last year for SCO founder Deane Ogden, we worked on a picture that had a very small music expense budget &#8212; well under what was necessary to complete a solid dramatic score with a live ensemble. After negotiating the creative fee, Deane trusted his instincts for the legs of the project and took the gig. As it turns out he was right - the film is in negotiations to be picked up by one of the big four and is on its way to theaters later this year... but not without a score that involved star international soloists, a live 30-piece orchestra, live group percussion of monumental proportions, and a professional mix and master by a top Hollywood engineer. AND we all got paid and ate great throughout the entire process! (Mmm... I love me some yummins!)<br />
<br />
We cut no corners on this score. Everything was top-notch. But what we *did* do was use left-over budget from a prior package deal where Deane had taken a smaller cut home in order to save dough for a bigger, badder orchestra on that next project.<br />
<br />
We made that few extra G's work in our favor in ways that you wouldn't believe. Our soloists were all international, so they recorded their parts in their respective studios live in realtime, and were able to communicate through each session over iChat AV. We also rented certain instruments we didn't have access to, as opposed to sampling them, so that we could record nuances and articulations that are not always present in sampled form, thus giving the sampled performances that much more of a realistic edge.<br />
<br />
Towards the end of the recording process, we ran up against a situation where we needed to hire a player who was not in the union. I called the union and was able to work out a deal to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taft%E2%80%93Hartley_Act#Entertainment_industry">"Taft Hartley"</a> the player onto the project. Not only did we get the player we wanted, but also now that person is enjoying a great relationship with the Local 47 as a full-fledged member.<br />
<br />
There are many more secrets and techniques that made this particular score special, but at every turn we forced ourselves to think  outside the box.<br />
<br />
<b>Is This Doable?</b><br />
You CAN do this stuff. You just have to think. Most of what I'm talking about here has to do with putting away your fear and really hanging your musical ass out there on the line. It *really* does. Is it scary to think about possibly sacrificing your take for the sake of a better sounding score? Yes! Is it tough to schedule time away from the sequencer in order to really conceptualize a killer idea for the overall musical arc? Yes!<br />
<br />
But see... it is these things, when you really dig out the info, that separates the pettily little Jai Meghans from the gargantuanly ginormous James Newton-Howards. And it's the risk and foresight of the James Newton-Howards that make these kinds of decisions a no-brainer for us emerging futurists.<br />

<div id='summary4914837067529465191'><div style="text-align: left;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sq8ewkJp-zI/AAAAAAAAAuA/NX_VhQyArxU/s1600-h/sanders-trenches.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sq8ewkJp-zI/AAAAAAAAAuA/NX_VhQyArxU/s320/sanders-trenches.png" /></a></div>This is one of those months where I want to write another <i>novel-length</i> column (hot on the heels of last week's Weekend Provocation, which was, how you say, <i>loooooong</i>). September's theme of scheduling and budgeting is that crucial. It's that fundamental. I'll try to help <i>you</i> stay on schedule, though, by keeping my focus limited.</div><div style="text-align: left;">I'm going to look at scheduling by diving into a couple of days out of my own composing life. With the help of some handy-dandy charts. What am I doing well? And, more importantly, where can I improve?</div><div><br />First, consider the following chart:</div><div></div><span style="color:#0000ee;"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5378203562790817122" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hCspY__CLOo/SqM3pTnjDWI/AAAAAAAAAFM/n-rlOcesuRc/s400/SCO+Day+Chart+1.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 400px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 369px;" /></span><br /><div>These are my actual time expenditures from last Wednesday (I kept a schedule&#8212;which accounted for about 15 of those 145 "admin" minutes).<br /><br />Some quick points and explanations:<br /><br />1. Notice that I got my eight hours of sleep&#8230; which is maybe even more important for me than it is for most people. I <i>need</i> my sleep.</div><div><br />2. Four hours of composing. <i>Weak</i>. But take another look: that also means that precisely half my day was spent doing other stuff. <b><i>Half!</i></b><br /><br />3. By far the worst offender here is my time spent on the web. That 150 minutes includes what I call "checking my vitals": Surfing my favorite news sites (Industry and otherwise); Facebook; downloading and working the New York Times Crossword; and, of course, SCOREcast. It also includes some goof-off stuff: I spent fully 20 minutes researching a trip out of the country on Expedia. It's going to be a fun trip, but if I don't get a little more strict about my daily schedule, I'm never gonna pay for it. :-)<br /><br />4. The second-biggest of the "other stuff" pie slices is admin: researching gear, paying bills, doing show paperwork, prepping the to-do list for my assistant and powering up the studio rig (twice! It crashed in the afternoon).<br /><br />5. Next biggest slice is meals. That leisurely lunch was brutal on my schedule. Not to mention that it takes me &#177;12 minutes to clean the coffee machine each night and make my first pot in the morning. Coffee is that important to me, though, so here's one area where the expenditure is largely justified.<br /><br />6. The 110 minutes for breaks includes phone calls with family and friends, as well as a lot of ear-breaks and general staring out the window (which I considered counting as part of my composing time&#8212;part of my process is to step away from the computers and listen inside my head every now and again). Nice to be able to make those calls, but it's a distraction. Not only does it eat up time on its own, but it requires even more time to get back into the flow of writing and recapture my ideas, my pace&#8230; everything.</div><div></div><div>Taken all in all, there's quite a bit of room for improvement, no? Entering it into a database (I'm using Apple Numbers '09 here) and generating a handy pie-chart is something I recommend you do for yourself, just to be able to manipulate the information easily&#8230; and take the panic and dread out of making changes.</div><div></div><div>Now let's consider this chart, which depicts a <i>very</i> different sort of day.</div><div></div><div></div><span style="color:#0000ee;"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5378203824968511666" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hCspY__CLOo/SqM34kTlMLI/AAAAAAAAAFU/RX9IqQTylLE/s400/SCO+Day+Chart+2.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 400px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 371px;" /></span><br /><div>Look at that big black slice of composing time, will you? It's just beautiful. When you hear about people doing 12 hour workdays, this is what they have to do to pull it off. Most of them aren't getting eight hours of sleep, of course, but if you choose to, here's a pie chart that represents how much time you'll have for everything.<br /><br />More notes:</div><div>1. Twelve hours of writing. <i>Twelve! </i>It's like a miracle.<br /><br />2. Meals now occupy the single largest block of non-sleep, non-composing time. I've sliced only a third of that meal time away. Eating too fast=indigestion=distraction=net time <i>loser</i>. Take your time&#8230; chew your food.<br /><br />3. <b>Huge</b> time reductions in the following categories: Web (now down to a positively <i>anorexic</i> 15 minutes); Admin (handing off most of these chores to my assistant); Breaks.<br /><br />4. Everything else is reduced, too&#8230; and errands are down to five minutes. I've chosen to delegate 'em to my assistant along with the Admin stuff. This is why assistants end up doing things like picking up dry cleaning.<br /><br />5. None of my categories is completely eliminated. I still have time (even if it's only a few minutes) to be a human being. In other words, for all its strictures, this is a <i>realistic</i> schedule.<br /><br />Realistic or not, though, Win-Day may not be the right fit for you. If you're working from home while managing a family and a day job, I can't imagine that this kind of schedule would be the norm (and it wouldn't be terribly useful, anyway&#8212;see next paragraph). But you can see how a few minutes here and there make a difference&#8212;and redefining the role of, say, your social media for a few days can free up a substantial chunk of time for writing.<br /><br />One more very important point here: If you haven't built up your "writing muscles" by writing a little longer&#8230; and a little longer&#8230; each day, that 12 hours at the computer (or piano, or guitar, or wherever you do what you do) is simply wasted time. You'll end up staring into the middle distance for 15, 20 minutes at a stretch, wondering why the Muse is so stingy. And you'll come off flat and uninspired for <i>days</i> afterward. You have to work up to this kind of output. Consistently.<br /><br />If you're a full-time writer in constant demand, that's not an issue. Otherwise, be warned.<br /><br />This pie chart is probably wrong for you. But I think there's value in considering it, anyway&#8230; and even more value in making your own. It's all just Time Management 101, sure&#8230; but it's also about actually <i>doing</i> it. I think being able to visualize the actual shape and effect of the changes helps. As a motivator, and as a tool for finding precisely where to make your scheduling "budget cuts."</div><div>Jump on the comments and let us know where you stand! Where are you strong; where do you need to do some time-crunching? I think it will be interesting to find out that most of us have similar weaknesses.</div></div>

<div id='summary3741163827787654502'><div style="font-family: georgia;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SqoLsE2Co1I/AAAAAAAAAt4/Fxgzn3AKKUY/s1600-h/cooke-ladder.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SqoLsE2Co1I/AAAAAAAAAt4/Fxgzn3AKKUY/s320/cooke-ladder.png" /></a></div>Its late on Tuesday night, and you've forgot to buy the groceries that day. The kitchen cupboards are bare, so there's nothing to be cooked. Your stomach growls at you in hunger, screaming "feed me" and you reluctantly decide that Turkish Kebab place down the road is your only option at this point. You return a few minutes later with that dirty kebab, and get back to work, having just spent more on the kebab than you would have done for about 2 days worth of food. Eventually after staring at the computer screen for another 2 hours, you feel sleepy and decide to call it a night - all due to that darn kebab. (What the hell - this is supposed to be about composing, not kebabs! OK, its a weird analogy - read on!)<br />
<br />
Budgeting and scheduling - our lives revolve around it - not just in composing, but in our every day activities. Everytime we budget and schedule something, it has a knock-on effect further down the road and can unknowingly influence the outcome of the many facets of our lives.<br />
<br />
I'll be completely honest - I'm not great at budgeting OR scheduling, but in the past few months I've become a little better at both.  However, this month's SCOREcast theme is about Budgeting and Scheduling in relation to film - not for life in general, so I would like to to share a few ideas/techniques with you, that will (hopefully) help you to schedule your studio time better.<b style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></b></div><br />
<div style="font-family: georgia;"></div><span style="font-family: georgia;"><i><b>Increasing Productivity in the Studio </b></i><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: georgia;"><b>- Draw some boundaries. </b>Keep your place of work seperate to your chillout/play area.  Having a defining line between your work area, and your chillout area, allows your brain to focus a lot easier with less distractions.  This has been mentioned a number of times on SCOREcast, and I'm sure all professional composers will tell you the same.</span><br />
<br />
<b>- Use templates in your DAW.</b> Sick of having to load up instruments seperately every time you want to create a new cue/track.  Why not create an empty template with your orchestra already set out for you - or go a step further, and have a number of different orchestral templates - ranging in size and dynamics.<br />
<br />
<b>- Take naps.</b> Benjamin Franklin, John F. Kennedy, Thatcher, Clinton, Einstein, Da Vinci, Brahms, and Beethoven all have it in common. They all took <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Power-Nap">power naps</a> during the day. Even Winston Churchill had it down to a tee - "You must sleep some time between lunch and dinner and no halfway measures. Take off your clothes and get into bed. That's what I always do. Don't think you will be doing less work because you sleep during the day. That's a foolish notion held by people who have no imagination. You will accomplish more. You get two days in one - well, at least one and a half, I'm sure".<span style="font-family: georgia;">&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: georgia;"><b>- Plan your milestones. </b>Create your goals for the day, then break them into smaller goals, and smaller goals again.  In my experience, creating goals means absolutely nothing for me, as I usually say to myself "yes I know I need to finish this piece of music before the end of the day".  However, when you break it down into easy to digest pieces, it becomes a lot easier to see the end and know how to get there.  Even if you for some reason don't complete your goal for the day, you know exactly how many smaller goals you will have to complete in the morning to get there.</span><span style="font-family: georgia;">&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: georgia;"><b>- Find your power band. </b>Figure out what time of the day you are productive at, and try work with it. Most people are either morning people, or evening people.  I don't know as many people that are as productive in the day time, as they are at morning/night.</span><br />
<br />
<b>- Go silent.</b> If you're writing an email to a director/client, putting on your headphones blocks out outside noises, and can help you concentrate a lot more.  Having no sound, or even just the sound of music, helps your brain stay on track and stay focused (I even know someone who listens to just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_noise">pink noise</a> as he works - I wouldn't advise that though...)<br />
<div style="font-family: georgia;"><br />
<b>- Culinary creativity.</b> You have 5 ingredients in the kitchen, and don't have time to go all the way down to the shops to buy anything else as you're in a rush (and you don't want that darn kebab again!). Try out the "Recipe Sifter Tool" on <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/sifter.php">RecipeZaar </a>- you can select the ingredients you have and it will give you a number of recipes that you can create with just those ingredients - jackpot!<br />
<br />
<b>- Update everything at once.</b> If you use social networking as a marketing tool, try <a href="http://ping.fm/">Ping.fm</a> - it can update up to 40 social networks with one swift stroke - saving you the time of having to go into every single social platform that you use, and update them all one by one.<br />
<br />
<b>- Condensed communication.</b> Able to type at the speed of light, and think you could talk to 4/5 people at the same time? Log into all of your chat programs at once with <a href="http://pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a>.  Its a lot more productive than having 5 different clients open at the same time - one for AIM, Gmail, MSN etc.<a href="http://www.pidgin.im/"> </a> <br />
<div></div><br />
<b>- Centralize your email.</b> Manage all of your email accounts using Gmail.  Gmail can manage all of your email accounts from your other websites - this saves you the time of having to log in to send/receive emails from other websites.<br />
<br />
<b>- Use shortcuts.</b> Shorten the time used between turning your PC on, and starting up your programs - try using one of a number of programs like <a href="http://www.launchy.net/#screenshots">Launchy</a>, <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotKey </a>or I quite like <a href="http://rocketdock.com/">Rocketdock</a>.  Launchy and Autohotkey both allow you to choose keystrokes or mouse movements to open programs in a flash. It might sound stupid, but when you're in a rush, every minute counts.</div><br />
<div style="font-family: georgia;"></div><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: small;">I would like to leave you with a question, and look forward to discussing it in the COMMENTS:<br />
<br />
</span><br />
<blockquote><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: small;"> "How much of an effect do you think that the availability of cheaper music licenses online, as well as the huge rise in amateur composers in the last number of years, has had </span><span style="font-family: georgia;">on the film industry in terms of budgeting and scheduling?"</span></blockquote><br />

When my family travels, we always try to book the best hotel room, the best flights, the best everything we can, even if it hurts a little. Because if I'm going to go on vacation, I want to do it right; I don't want to spend my hard-earned time off "just getting by". That's just our preference.<br /><br />For many things, I'm fine with what works, even if it's not the best. In a few areas, I'm plain cheap. Take wine for example. I really like wine, but I consider it one of those luxuries I'm not usually willing to overpay for. The good thing about wine, it's not impossible to find a great <i>and reasonably priced </i>one. I've taken some time to learn about it- to learn not only how it's made, but also about the different regions, grapes, techniques, vintages, and so on. This extra education has made it easier for me to identify a wine I'd probably like, from which regions, from which years, and so on. The net result is I'm able to find me some pretty darn good- <i>yet inexpensive </i>wine. I consider it a personal victory if I can find a truly awesome wine that lightens me by only $10-$15.<br /><br />I'm a little like this when searching for music production equipment. I get personal satisfaction from finding a great plugin or other gear that works perfectly for my needs, and it didn't cost me an arm-and-leg. Case in point, I love my <a href="http://www.korgnano.com/">Korg nanoKONTROL</a>. I needed some hardware controllers, didn't need much else, my nanoKONTROL was like $60. I also sold my <a href="http://www.akaipro.com/mpc1000">Akai MPC1000</a> and replaced it with <a href="http://www.native-instruments.com/#/en/products/producer/battery-3/">Native Instruments Battery 3</a> recently for $99, which netted me a profit <i>and</i> Battery works better with my rig. Win for me.<br /><br />For this month's DIY Studio topic, I'd like to turn it back to you and ask:<br /><blockquote>Thinking about all your gear and software, what do you consider your best "win" as far as bang for the buck?</blockquote>Since we're talking DIY, let's see if we can keep it under $100, but if you have a great one <i>for the money</i>, don't worry about going over. Let's hear about it.<br /><br />And also if you know of any great inexpensive wine on the market.</div>

If, at the very least, we're looking to break even (i.e., not have to pay for the privilege of writing music), we ought to know what kind of return we need on each minute we create.<br /><br />You can get as granular as you want with this, but I think starting with a broad-strokes approach is acceptable for our purposes. And it'll give you a good sense of how to budget and schedule&#8230; making it <i>topical</i> for our month-long SCOREcast feature.<br /><div><div></div><div>Let's start with the <b>music</b> itself. Calculate a rough estimate of how many minutes of music you create in an average year&#8230; going back five years, adding up all the minutes of music you've created, and dividing by five. This is your <b>Yearly Average Production</b> (YAP, for those of you who like acronyms).<br /><br />You can base your YAP on a single year, by the way, instead of going back five years. But I do recommend going back, especially if you've been doing this for a while. The busy years and the lean years will sort of cancel out that way. If you're just getting started, you might want to include only your most recent year. Whatever number seems most accurate and meaningful to you&#8230; moving forward we'll call that number <i>X</i>.<br /><br />Now let's look at <b>time</b>. Add up all the minutes you spend on your music&#8212;including the whole staring-out-the-window part (on this whole topic of time I will have more, much more to say in "View from the Trenches," next Wednesday. Shameless self-promotion in play!). Add <i>X</i> years' worth of minutes, divide by <i>X</i>, and you have a nice average yearly number&#8230; your <b>Yearly Estimated Time Investment</b> (YETI).</div><div></div><div>For the <i>money</i> side of the equation, it's the same thing: Go back <i>X</i> years. Add up all your studio expenses. Gear, of course&#8230; but also things like office equipment and supplies, career-related phone bills, iTunes purchases, rent/mortgage (for your studio, or an appropriate fraction of your rent/mortgage if you're home-based). Basically, if you deduct it on your taxes as a business expense, include it here. A rough estimate will suffice. Divide that total by <i>X</i> to arrive at a <b>Yearly Average Cost of Composing</b> (YACC).</div><div></div><div>Now comes the part we've all been waiting for. Divide your YAM by your YETI to arrive at the actual time cost of a minute of music. Likewise, YAM/YACC yields the actual financial cost for you to create one minute of music. If you want to make a profit, that one minute has to generate more than YAM/YACC. And knowing YAM/YETI will tell you how much music you can reasonably create in a year's time, when you devote the hours you choose to devote to your career.<br /><br />By the way, please note here that we're factoring in all the ancillary time-stuff as well&#8230; and that's <i>so</i> important.<br /><br />We've talked before about "batting averages" and how long it takes to write one minute of music, but all of that was only in the context of <i>simply sitting down and writing</i>. This is different. Here we're taking into account researching and purchasing gear, archiving files, poring over legal contracts, taking lunches with producers, etc. Both stats are important; each gives you a slightly different piece of data.</div><div></div><div>Here's an example of how it all comes together. All numbers are fictitious, but reasonable for a full-time working composer.<br /><br />Meet Nigel Demiquaver. You all know Nigel for his fine score for the television series <i>The Dunes of My Spleen</i>. Great work, although that Emmy snub (nominated, but lost out to Bartholomew Phlegm&#8230; that hack!) was a bit of a scandal in the community a few months ago. Anyway, let's run the numbers on Nigel and see what he needs to make per minute just to break even.<b> </b><br /><br /><b>Music:</b> Nigel is prolific. Phenomenally so: He's scored 23 episodes of <i>Spleen</i> (avg. 20 min.s per episode) for each of the last five years, and he's scored three feature-length films to boot (avg. 60 min.s per picture). That's a total of 2,480 minutes of music. Let's round up to 2,500 over the five years' time&#8212;throwing in a commercial here and there, and maybe a few minutes composed for, oh, a web series&#8212;for a colossal <b>YAP</b> of <b>500 minutes</b>.<b> </b><br /><br /><b>Time:</b> I'll speed things up a bit by saying that, in an average year, Nigel spends 22 weeks in full-on "music mode"&#8212;brutal, 80-hour weeks. Another 18 weeks are spent in a less-intense mode (sending out demos, archiving, paperwork, writing a bit, etc.): 40-hour weeks for that time. Add an extra 20 miscellaneous hours over the rest of the year and it comes out to a nice, even and fairly true-to-life <b>YETI</b> of <b>2,500 hours</b>.<b> </b><br /><br /><b>Money:</b> Again, I'll just give you yearly averages on all of this. There's a lot to reckon with here, so bear with me. Nigel tries to stay current, spending an average of $10,000 a year just on hardware (new Macs &amp; PCs, plus the occasional mic or office chair or piece of outboard gear). He employs two assistants who cost $8,000 a year <i>each</i> to keep around (that would be something like 10 hours a week, every week, at $15 per hour, apiece). Each episode of <i>Spleen</i> (that's 23 a year) costs an average $1,000 in musicians and engineers&#8212;and that's an incredibly low number to plug in here&#8212;so we add another $23,000 to the yearly tally. $4,000 a year is Nigel's investment in software and sample libraries, and the cost of his studio space is $36,000 per year (that's a 1,500 square foot studio at $2 per square foot per month in rent&#8230; reasonable given LA costs these days). Utilities cost him $2000 for the year, and internet/website costs another $200.<br /><br />Nigel kisses another $3,000 goodbye as he takes potential clients out to lunch, dinner, drinks and concerts (enjoyable, all&#8212;but a legitimate cost of doing business). Emmy night alone costs him nearly $1,000. He spends $600 per year in office supplies (toner cartridges ain't cheap!); another $2,000 promoting himself online and in print; $500 for postage, overnight delivery, and messenger services&#8230; I'll stop there, although the costs continue. You can see where this number is going, yes?<span style="font-weight: bold;"> YACC =<span style="font-weight: normal;"> <b>$100,000</b>.</span></span></div><div></div><div>None of these numbers are exact&#8212;and they don't need to be&#8212;but they're reasonably close to what you'd see in the real, professional world. And they do paint the picture. Do the math, and you can see that <b><i>one minute of music, for Nigel, requires 5 hours and $200.</i></b></div><div><b><i><br /></i></b></div><div>If Nigel makes $600 per minute up front (i.e., his package for each TV episode is about $12,000), he's already made $276,000 per year&#8230; but a package deal that handsome is increasingly rare in today's world. Let's cut it in half. Even at that&#8212;$138,000&#8212;he's $38k toward having a life, paying taxes, etc. Royalties will vary wildly, but it's reasonable to say that, if <i>Spleen</i> is a network or basic-cable show, he'll see between $200-$400 per minute in back end (domestic and international) over the life cycle of the cue. That means somewhere between $100,000 and $200,000 more for Nigel per year. Makes that Emmy-less awards shelf a bit more bearable, doesn't it? And it covers the cost of those three little movies he scored (which were sort of long-term investments anyway: he put the entire budget "into the scores," making next to nothing so that, if the directors move ahead in the world, they might remember him and hire him for the Next Big Gig. Arguable whether that's a winning strategy long-term, but that's what he did).</div><div></div><div>Even if Nigel's TV show were to air on a much smaller network, where per-minute royalties are substantially less, he stands to make reasonable coin if he keeps his writer's share. He'll make even more if he owns a percentage of the publishing royalties as well. But no show is forever (except maybe <i>The Simpsons</i>), and Nigel is going to have to save a hefty chunk of his income to tide him over during the inevitable slow times. His expenses during those lean periods are likely to go up if he's hustling for gigs, using the down time to re-vamp and re-outfit his studio, creating demo cues for projects, etc. Counterintuitive, but true. There is an economy of scale here: the magnitude of these numbers may not be applicable to your career (yet!), but the factors to consider are almost all the same. </div><div></div><div><i><span style="font-style: normal;">The consequences and value of having your own version of all this information, I think, is evident.

How many of you buy photos or have even heard of the website, <a href="http://istockphoto.com/">iStockphoto.com</a>?  Well...the stock audio market is pretty much the same - license music tracks for a one off small fee.  It is "royalty free", meaning (obviously) you won't receive any back-end <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royalties" rel="wikipedia" title="Royalties">royalties</a> from it.  Due to this, you would think that you would be rewarded by this with a greater one off payment - but you would be wrong :)<br />
The "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royalty-free">Royalty Free</a>/Stock Audio" market can be a small stream of income for you, and it can be enough to pay your bills  in those months where an income is scarce (quite a deal for a professional composer OR composer on his way there).<br />
<br />
Before I go any further, I just want to make you aware of some of the terms that will be used:<br />
<br />
<u><i>Exclusive</i></u>: You sell your music <span style="font-style: italic;">exclusively</span> on that website, and cannot sell it anywhere else if you sell it there.<br />
<br />
<u><i>Non-exclusive</i></u>: You can sell your music on any and every website at the same time.<br />
<br />
<u><i>Royalty Free</i></u>: You will not receive any back-end performance royalties if your music is used for TV.<br />
<br />
<b>Selling Online</b><br />
Selling music online in the <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_music" rel="wikipedia" title="Production music">stock music</a> market, can be easy or hard, profitable or unprofitable, great for your career, or not so great for it.  It all depends on <span style="font-style: italic;">what </span>you are selling, the <span style="font-style: italic;">quantity </span>of it, and <span style="font-style: italic;">where</span> you are selling it.  Ok - so thats very vague, but I'm being vague for a reason - I know quite a few people who sell music online in the stock music market, and the difference in income they receive from it is huge.  Some people have a portfolio of tracks that is close to 400-500 tracks, and some have about 80-100 and both could make the exact same each month from it.<br />
<br />
What I have learnt over the past 2 years or so that I've been selling music online in the royalty free market, is that <span style="font-style: italic;">quality</span> resides over <span style="font-style: italic;">quantity, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">generic </span>works better than <span style="font-style: italic;">specific.  </span>Allow me to explain.<br />
<br />
My first point is pretty obvious I suppose really - quality nearly always resides over quantity when it comes to selling anything, no matter what the product.  However, I know a composer who has about 470 tracks on a particular website, and I have about 40 tracks on the same website.  Neither of us market our tracks on the site, but yet in the 2 years that we have both been members on the site, I have made about three times the sales that he has.  My point here is that, I have some good quality tracks on the website, that stand out from the crowd a little more than his do, and thus they get bought more often.  Filling the website with your tracks won't make people buy more of them - you'll just get people who are sick of searching for tracks, and having to trail through hundreds of search results, which are laden with your tracks.<br />
<br />
This brings us to my second point - "generic" over "specific".  Say you have 5 tracks that are very generic and could be used for lets say a film, ad, tv, presentation or website, and another person has 5 tracks that only really suit a corporate presentation, who do you think will get more sales? In my experience (which again could be wrong), tracks which can be used for multiple purposes will have a larger potential market than tracks which can only be used for one purpose.<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Websites</span><br />
Before we go any further, I just want to say that all of this is just my opinion and experience.  Its not the "ultimate truth".  It is all built on my experiences from selling on a number of websites, and your experiences could vary to mine (in fact they most likely will!).  Also, just because I didn't do well on any particular websites, doesn't mean that you won't either - my portfolio of tracks will be totally different to yours, so try them all out!<br />

<b>My personal opinion</b>: Micro-pricing for music sales - $10 is average track sale, but if you are non-exclusive, then you will only earn $2.50 per track! They don&#8217;t email you when a track is sold, which other sites do, but you can still track your sales easily on the site when you login. Great community, and nice feedback on each track everytime you upload by the reviewer. Three types of licenses do allow you to earn more per track, which is a nice addition (1x, 3x 50x)<br />
<br />
Price your own tracks? <b>No</b><br />
Account-driven or demo/review-driven? <b>Open an account - uploads are reviewed</b><br />
Accepting submissions from outside composers? <b>Yes</b><br />
Payout and split arrangement? <b>25/75 non exclusive, 30/70 exclusive (increases if you sell more)</b><br />
Any backend royalties? <b>No</b><br />
Option to be Exclusive/Non-exclusive? <b>Yes</b><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />

<a href="http://revostock.com/"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Revostock</span></a><br />
<b>My personal opinion</b>: Really easy upload process - upload via ftp, then put description on each track. Have a weekly newsletter which sends out the top tracks of the week to all subscibers, getting your music more views if its on it. Good track pricing - ie. $10- $15 and nice payout out 45% per track. Mail you when a track is sold which is nice to see in your inbox. Also 3 types of licenses to increase your income.<br />
<br />
Allow uploads? <b>Yes</b><br />

<b>My Personal opinion</b>: I have only ever sold one track on here but I do know a few composers who have had some sales on it, for commercial licenses, and made a nice amount of money from it. Well worth trying and seeing how you get on.<br />

<br />
<i><b><a href="http://audiosparx.com/">Audiosparx</a></b></i><br />
<b>My Personal Opinion</b>: I have only ever sold one track on Audiosparx.  Its a huge library, so I think it may be harder to get your music noticed on it, in comparison to other similar sites.  It has a huge amount of flexibility, in terms of pricing, licenses, ways of uploading, marketing etc. so could be valuable if you are willing to put in a lot of work into it.<br />
<br />

<b><i><a href="http://musicloops.com/">Musicloops</a></i><br />
</b><b>My Personal opinion</b>: Great site - easy to upload and I've made a lot of money from this website.  Payments are always on time, the library on here is of a good enough size for your music to be found, and its easy to upload.  You get an email every time a track sells, which is nice to see, and I've had absolutely no problems with this site.  Well worth joining in my opinion.<br />
<br />

<br />
<i><b><a href="http://partnersinrhyme.com/">Partnersinrhyme</a></b></i><br />
<b>My Personal Opinion</b>: Brilliant site. Sells music collections, so if your music is good enough, and a unique genre, you may be able to sell a collection of your music on here. Well worth having your tracks on. I&#8217;ve made the most money out of this site, and its a great site to be on if you get the opportunity.<br />
<br />
Allow uploads? <b>No</b><br />
Price your own tracks? <b>No (composers have input on what prices might be though)</b><br />
Account-driven or demo/review-driven? <b>Submit a demo</b><br />

Non-exclusive? <b>Yes</b><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>&nbsp;</b><i><b><a href="http://youlicense.com/">YouLicense</a></b></i><br />
<br />
<b>My personal opinion</b>: I&#8217;ve uploaded tracks to their site, and have sold one or two mp3 tracks for a few bucks. They have a fresh approach, and are exactly what a lot of composers I know, are looking for. You get to choose what licenses you can offer on your tracks, and there is a cool opportunites page, with listings of people that are looking for you to submit your tracks to them for projects. Another brilliant thing which they have is the <i>youlicense</i> <i>widget</i> which you can add to your site - you can check out mine <a href="http://soundtrack.ie/downloads.html"> here </a> - it lets you sell your music via your own website, without having to embed an mp3 store on your site. Great ideas from this site.<br />
<br />
Allow uploads? <b>Yes</b><br />
Price your own tracks? <b>Yes (You get to choose each price for each license)</b><br />
Account-driven or demo/review-driven? <b>You can just open an account and start uploading</b><br />
Accepting submissions from outside composers? <b>Yes</b><br />
Payout and split arrangement? <b> Free Account = You pay 10 cents per track sold and you set the prices; Pro Musician and Business accounts = You pay nothing on MP3 sales</b><br />
Any backend royalties? <b>Depends on each project</b><br />
Non-exclusive? <b>Yes</b><i><b>&nbsp;</b></i><br />
<br />
<br />
<i><b><a href="http://soundreef.com/">Soundreef</a> </b></i> <br />
<b>My personal opinion</b>: Cool idea - swapping music for promotion. I&#8217;ve never seen it done before, and I think it could work well. I think the site is currently in its early stages (its currently in Beta, and has been for about 6 months now I believe) - but definitively worth checking out.<br />
<br />
Allow uploads? <b>Yes</b><br />
Price your own tracks? <b>Yes (You get to agree on a price per project)</b><br />
Account-driven or demo/review-driven? <b>Currently in private beta, but you can get numerous invitations online if you search</b><br />
Accepting submissions from outside composers? <b>Yes</b><br />
Payout and split arrangement? <b>Composer - 75%/ Site - 25%</b><br />
Any backend royalties? <b>Depends on each project</b><br />
Non-exclusive? <b>Yes</b><i><b>&nbsp;</b></i><br />
<br />
<br />
<i><b><a href="http://pumpaudio.com/">Pumpaudio</a></b></i><br />
<b>My personal opinion</b>: Large site owned by Ghetty Images. Have some huge clients, and you could have your music being viewed by some big names out there. I know some people who have had great experience and sales from it. After approximately a year or more now, my music is not in their library yet, so I'm not certain how long you may be waiting.  There is quite a lot of upset over their decision to change the <a href="http://www.filmmusicmag.com/?p=3109">composer payout to 30%</a> and many believe it to be very unfair (large corporation vs. musicians etc.) Check it out yourself and see what you think - there is some great opportunity for success.<br />
<br />
<b></b><br />
Allow uploads? <b>Yes</b><br />
Price your own tracks? <b>Yes</b><br />

<br />
<br />
<b>In Conclusion</b><br />
<b></b>So what conclusions can we draw from this? Well...<br />
<ul><li>The stock audio market can be a great additional/supplemental income for you as a composer in months when your streams of revenue are low <br />
</li>
</ul><ul><li>It can be beneficial to be exclusive on one or two particular sites, depending on how well you do on them, and what their payout/track pricings are. On the other hand, it could be just as beneficial having your music on all of the websites in a non-exlusive deal <br />
</li>
</ul><ul><li>Putting up a track on stock audio websites that has taken you two weeks to create, compared to putting up a track that took you a few hours to create, might not be worthwhile if both will sell for the same low price - choose which tracks to sell for the low price, and keep the good ones to license for higher paying projects <br />
</li>
</ul><ul><li>The stock audio market can be a great marketing tool for you as a composer. I, myself, have had numerous business opportunities and contacts come from selling my music on royalty free libraries, and it has been a very worthwhile venture in terms of extra cash, new contacts, and marketing.</li>
</ul>There are literally hundreds of these type of websites out there - the above list is a short list of some I have tried out.<br />
<br />
Don't take my word as the "Be All and End All" of opinions.  Try them out yourself and you might have a different experiences.<br />
<br />
Also, if any SCOREcasters out there have had experiences with any services *not* listed here, let's hear about them in the COMMENTS! <br />

You may recall from my July 15 article on <span style="font-style: italic;">WIVI</span>s (<span style="font-weight: bold;">W</span>allander <span style="font-weight: bold;">I</span>nteractive <span style="font-weight: bold;">V</span>irtual <span style="font-weight: bold;">I</span>nstruments) that I&#8217;ve been exploring orchestration and simultaneously honing my MIDI skills by sequencing <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky" rel="wikipedia" title="Igor Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a>&#8217;s classic work, <span style="font-style: italic;"><a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rite_of_Spring" rel="wikipedia" title="The Rite of Spring">The Rite Of Spring</a></span>.  Today, I&#8217;d like to share some of the key things I&#8217;ve learned so far in this ongoing, long-term project.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Questions and Goals</span><br />
<br />
How does my project relate to SCOREcast&#8217;s theme of the month:  <span style="font-style: italic;">planning and scheduling</span>?  Well, I&#8217;d argue that before you can schedule and plan major scoring projects for real clients, you need how you&#8217;re going to do the job.  Before you commit yourself to a deadline with financial consequences, you&#8217;d better have in place a well-practiced, ready-to-go <span style="font-style: italic;">workflow </span>capable of progressing from concept to deliverable product.  You need to be able to break down a prospective project into composing and production sub-tasks you understand, and be calibrated on how long it will take you (and any collaborators) to complete each of these tasks.  Then you can make a plan and schedule.<br />
<br />
Those are the <span style="font-style: italic;">real </span>goals.  But the needed workflow is based in part on having access to and mastery of an adequate set of <span style="font-style: italic;">tools</span>.  You can't very well figure out how you're going to work without knowing what your tools are going to be.  Which tools are most appropriate will depend on your training, artistic preferences and aims, and financial resources.  For many of us, in this digital age, those tools include a computer or computers, digital audio workstation (DAW) software, virtual instrument (VI) libraries, at least basic audio gear, and perhaps musical instruments (such as a MIDI keyboard) for getting our musical ideas into the computer and/or software programs that hopefully streamline various composing and production tasks.  Some individuals have the chops to get the job done <span style="font-style: italic;">without </span>all of these technological crutches, and I admire them greatly &#8211; but in this article, I&#8217;m addressing those who want or need to go the technology route.<br />
<br />
Among the <span style="font-style: italic;">technorati</span>, many will explore and prototype their cues and songs using <span style="font-style: italic;">MIDI</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">mockup</span>, and some will even use MIDI as their means of final production.  With this aim comes a bewildering array of questions.  How much computer will I need?  What type of computer, how fast, how much RAM, how much disk, what operating system, what software, what libraries?  How many bits, what sample rate?  On and on.  So much to learn, so much to decide.  And I am down in the trenches grappling with these issues, every day.<br />
<br />
As a writer for SCOREcast Online, it continues to be one of my objectives to make this process just a little less daunting by sharing a substantial amount of detail about what I&#8217;m finding as my particular musico-technical journey progresses.  Keep in mind that I&#8217;m among those deeply interested in MIDI and expect it to play a key role in my workflow.  At this stage of my development, I have a couple of key goals:  1) I want to learn about composing and orchestrating for traditional orchestra;  and  2) I want to be able to play back my <span style="font-style: italic;">full orchestra</span> MIDI mockups, in <span style="font-style: italic;">real time</span>, on a<span style="font-style: italic;"> single computer</span>, as I compose.  Write it, play it back &#8211; again and again, as efficiently as possible.  If your goals are roughly comparable, you may find something here that you can use.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What I&#8217;m Doing, Musically</span><br />
<br />
I&#8217;m <span style="font-style: italic;">not </span>aiming to re-arrange Stravinsky&#8217;s score for <span style="font-style: italic;">The Rite Of Spring</span> &#8211; although some judicious substitutions may be necessary in cases where I don&#8217;t have exactly what I need in my VI libraries.  I&#8217;m also not trying to match the interpretation that any particular orchestra, conductor, or engineer may have made of Stravinsky&#8217;s work.  I don&#8217;t expect to fool an expert listener into thinking he or she is hearing a real orchestra, but I do want the result to be good enough that perhaps the vast majority of lay listeners would accept it as being worth listening to.  I also want it to succeed as a carrier of mood and emotion.<br />
<br />
I <span style="font-style: italic;">am </span>literally taking Stravinsky&#8217;s score (actually, the Dover edition of the full score) and using my MIDI skills and technology assets to produce a MIDI sequence from it, with great care given to the many nuances written into the score and many other nuances that are the result of my own musical interpretation.  The intensive, extended practice steadily improves both my sequencing and my ear.<br />
<br />
Experts will probably find in my MIDI work plenty of things to complain about, with justification.  They will be expecting to hear what they&#8217;re accustomed to hearing, based on their knowledge and experience of real orchestras.  In some passages, the MIDI mockup will come very close to &#8220;real&#8221;, while in other cases I think it&#8217;s fair to say that the result will include some elements that sound unfamiliar or aberrant when judged from the perspective of real orchestra.  Yet even these problematic elements can function well and have appeal in their own right.  I think most listeners are far less critical than the experts and can find much to enjoy in this technologically-produced music.  Does it sound like what Stravinsky had in mind?  I don&#8217;t know.  Would he roll over in his grave?  Honestly, I doubt it &#8230; though he might raise his eyebrows a bit.<br />
<br />
By immersing myself in bringing the score to life, I&#8217;m discovering (or re-discovering) plenty about how one can create interesting and compositionally useful sounds using the instruments of traditional orchestra &#8211; or, more accurately, the instruments of my particular virtual orchestra.  The process also forces me to learn a great deal about reading scores.  In addition, I find that I encounter &#8211; and eventually overcome &#8211; one technological hurdle after another.  This is making me increasingly expert at applying all of my tools and, ultimately, is contributing much to the workflow I need to develop.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Some Early Results</span><br />
<br />
To give you an idea what this stuff sounds like, I&#8217;ve provided links to two examples.  To listen to these MP3s, you&#8217;ll need to download the files to your computer, and then play them using any suitable MP3-capable playback software, such as Windows Media Player, Quicktime, etc.  If possible, listen to these stereo recordings through good speakers on a decent, flat-response audio system such as you may have if you&#8217;ve assembled the basics of a project studio.<br />
<br />
The first MP3 contains the <span style="font-style: italic;">Introduction </span>to <span style="font-style: italic;">The Rite Of Spring</span>.  You may hear some evolution in my mockup technique between the beginning and the end of this piece.<br />
<br />
Link:  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ncq7fo">TheRiteOfSpring_1A_Introduction_JimWell.mp3</a><br />
<br />
In the second MP3 you may hear still further evolution in technique.  This MP3 contains the first 2:40 of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Augurs Of Spring</span> (<span style="font-style: italic;">The Dances Of The Young Girls</span>), the movement immediately following the <span style="font-style: italic;">Introduction</span>.  The recording ends abruptly after 2:40 simply because that&#8217;s how far I&#8217;ve gotten.  You can see that these are works in progress.<br />

Please do share your impressions about this music, and any comments you may have about how well it&#8217;s meeting my stated objectives so far, or how it could be improved.<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How I&#8217;m Doing It</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Experienced SCOREcast readers may yawn and say, &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">Yeah, so</span>?&#8221;  But I&#8217;m pretty sure many other readers who are slowly working their way up would like to know what it has taken, from a music technology standpoint, to create these two full-orchestra MIDI performances &#8211; and, moreover, to be able to render them in real time on a single computer.  Of course, you can figure these things out for yourself, but learning the hard way (by trial and error) can make an already expensive proposition even more expensive.  So, here we go.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Computer.  </span>After earlier disappointments with lesser computers &#8211; including one specifically designed for music-making &#8211; I concluded that half-measures just weren&#8217;t going to cut it, and that if I was going to be serious about working with full orchestra, I needed something more powerful.  With what I had, I could neither fit all the VIs of an orchestra at one time, nor run them fast enough to avoid the dreaded pops and clicks (or worse &#8211; crashes) that occurred when the CPU or disk couldn&#8217;t keep up with the demand for their services.  In addition, it became painfully clear that I was going to need more storage capacity for the better-quality libraries of sample-based VIs (sample disk), for project data including lots of large audio, video, MIDI, and other media (project disk), and for system and application files (system disk) &#8211; preferably all on separate drives for performance reasons.  And the motherboard(s) needed to be capable of the very high data throughput implied by fast computing, massive disk I/O, and audio streaming.  Those were just the primary concerns.  There were also many other practical issues related to being able to operate in a more reliable manner, such as being able to make backups of huge amounts of data.<br />
<br />
It appeared there were basically two choices:  either a network of synchronized computers (say, a bunch of PCs, Macs, or Muse Receptors) running collaborating software applications, or a bigger, badder single computer.  From years of experience as an engineer, I judged that the multi-machine approach was almost guaranteed to bring its own crop of operational and reliability headaches.  Moreover, it wasn&#8217;t likely to be any cheaper than a single, large machine &#8211; and maybe more expensive.  Thus, I went with the single, big machine option.  I thought this would enable me to work more or less the same way I had before, when my objectives were much more modest than full orchestra &#8211; only now everything would scale up by a large factor.<br />
<br />
Bigger and badder -- but <span style="font-style: italic;">how</span>?  Well, at the time I was considering all of this (about 18 months ago), I was expecting that most or all of my virtual orchestra would be sample-based VIs, like those I could get from <span style="font-style: italic;">EastWest </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">Vienna</span>.  I knew that in order to have samples ready to play at the moment they&#8217;re needed, sample players (such as EastWest&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">Play </span>engine or Native Instruments&#8217; <span style="font-style: italic;">Kontakt</span>) need to load some portion of the samples &#8211; those that represent the front ends of any notes that might be played &#8211; into RAM ahead of time.  While those samples are being played during real-time rendition of a musical composition, the sample player is reading the follow-on samples into RAM from disk.  In theory, if you had a sufficiently fast disk, you could get away without pre-loading any samples into RAM and read them all from disk when needed.  Then you might be able to get by with a relatively small amount of RAM.  But disk systems fast enough for this either don&#8217;t exist or would be prohibitively expensive; so, in general, a practical trade-off is made, involving both a lot of RAM, fast disk, and various system optimizations that avoid bottlenecks that could interfere with moving large blocks of data quickly from disk to RAM.  (The said optimizations are much of what you&#8217;re presumably paying for when you buy a computer that&#8217;s claimed to be specially tuned for digital audio application.)<br />
<br />
But &#8211; since I didn&#8217;t know exactly <span style="font-style: italic;">how much </span>of each computing resource was going to be needed, I could by no means be sure I&#8217;d need less than 4 Gbytes of RAM.  This amount of RAM is the great dividing line between 32-bit computers and 64-bit computers.  In other words, if your DAW application will use more than 4 Gbytes when all of the needed VIs are loaded, you&#8217;ll need a 64-bit computer, because a 32-bit computer can&#8217;t address more than 4 Gbytes of RAM (without using tricks that you&#8217;d really rather not rely upon).<br />
<br />
So I took the plunge for a 64-bit computer, and decided to aim for 16 Gbytes of RAM.  How did I pick 16 Gbytes?  Well, there were three factors.  First, I had been reading that one needed at least 8 Gbytes of RAM to work with a full orchestra, so I took that as a lower limit, even though I couldn&#8217;t justify this figure at the time.  Second, the pricing of RAM was such that cost per Gbyte took a sharp upward turn above 16 Gbytes, while the cost to go from 8 Gbytes to 16 Gbytes was not prohibitive.  The third factor was my knowledge that, within limits, one could compensate for having less RAM by having a faster disk.  (Some sample players, such as Kontakt, have a software option that lets you adjust the amount of sample data the player will pre-load into RAM &#8211; which is the principal issue affecting total RAM usage.)  My strategy was to configure a very fast dedicated disk drive for my samples &#8211; this way, I figured that if a slower disk would force me above 16 Gbytes of RAM, maybe a much faster disk was insurance that 16 Gbytes would be adequate.  As I&#8217;ll discuss later, this seems to have proven correct, based on my <span style="font-style: italic;">Rite Of Spring</span> experiences.<br />
<br />
The fast sample disk was achieved by adding a RAID controller card to my computer and using four Western Digital <span style="font-style: italic;">Raptor </span>150-Gbyte drives, combined into a single RAID-0 array with a total formatted capacity of 558 Gbytes.  Even without creating the RAID array, these drives are very fast, turning at 10K RPM and having an access time about half that of more ordinary disks.  This solution was a bit pricey, but it gave me a lot of confidence that disk speed would not be the weak link in my system.<br />
<br />
My computer&#8217;s internal system drive, together with the four Raptors, made for a total of 5 internal drives.  I couldn&#8217;t put any more than this number inside the box, so I knew that any additional disk, such as for project data storage, additional sample library storage, and backup meant I&#8217;d need to use external disk drives.  My initial plan was to use <span style="font-style: italic;">Firewire </span>drives for all of these purposes, but for reasons that I never fully uncovered, this arrangement never worked reliably or at the performance level I needed for serious productivity.  After about six very painful months of struggling with these problems, I ended up using a bunch of external drives interfaced to the unused SATA ports of my motherboard and RAID controller card.  Two of these physical drives are combined into a single, 930-Gbyte logical drive configured as a RAID-0 array &#8211; this drive is used for additional, lower-priority sample libraries that don&#8217;t fit on the internal Raptor array.  A third, fixed 465-Gbyte drive stores project data.  A removable fourth drive, also with 465 Gbytes of formatted capacity, is loaded into a drive bay whenever I need to make backups of system or project data.<br />
<br />
As I&#8217;ve said, the computer&#8217;s motherboard needs to be capable of meeting the data throughput demands imposed by having to move massive amounts of sample data from disk to RAM during playback, and, during recording of audio tracks, from RAM to disk as well.  For this purpose, I went with a Windows-compatible computer built around a server-class motherboard (<span style="font-style: italic;">Tyan</span> 5396) that hosts two quad-core <span style="font-style: italic;">Intel Xeon </span>CPUs, for a total of 8 CPU cores.  These CPUs, the chipset that supports them, and the motherboard design work synergistically to achieve very fast data bus and cache operation, essential to avoid data bottlenecks.  By the way, taking advantage of the multi-CPU architecture requires DAW, VI, and driver software to be written explicitly with this in mind.  Fortunately this has, in fact, been occurring. <br />
<br />
Why did I choose a Windows machine and not a Mac?  Well, for one thing, I had been using Windows for the previous 12 years, was comfortable with it, and was using other Windows machines with which I wanted to remain compatible.  I also felt that the Windows world offered more options, and I knew that much of the software I was interested in using was supported on both Mac and PC if I ever decided to move to a Mac.  Finally, at the time, I perceived that Microsoft&#8217;s operating systems had somewhat of an edge in supporting 64-bit computing with large amounts of RAM.  So far I haven&#8217;t regretted my decision.<br />
<br />
The CPU cores operate at a clock speed of 2.67 GHz.  Why did I choose that speed, which is not the fastest available?   Again, a judgment call based on tradeoffs.  First, the cost of higher-speed CPUs increases more rapidly than the extra benefit they deliver &#8211; i.e., you get more bang for the buck at middle-level speeds.  Second, a faster CPU may require the other system components (e.g., RAM) to be faster as well &#8211; increasing the cost impact.  Third, higher clock rates can mean higher power dissipation, such that your computer runs hotter &#8211; and that reduces reliability.  So, I stuck my finger in the wind and chose the middle ground.  My choice has turned out to be adequate.<br />
<br />
The motherboard also has quite a few slots for PCI expansion cards.  Experience has shown that having enough of these slots is crucial &#8211; I&#8217;m using all the slots I have, and would use more if I had them.<br />
<br />
One last detail:  I chose an <span style="font-style: italic;">RME 9652 </span>card as my computer&#8217;s audio interface.  This choice was made because RME was early in providing a driver that supports 64-bit operation.  The 9652 also has three ADAT input and 3 ADAT output ports, collectively capable of moving up to 24 channels of audio at 48 KHz sample rate.  This is how I move digital audio streams between my computer and my outboard gear, including my A/D-D/A converter.  Most of the time, I use no more than 4 of the 24 audio channels for the type of work I&#8217;ve chosen to do &#8211; i.e., I&#8217;m not trying to create a full-blown recording studio, per se, but rather an environment for MIDI-enabled composing.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Software. </span> Once I determined that a 64-bit computer was the way I&#8217;d go, I was in dangerous territory, because to use such a machine in a way that takes full advantage of RAM above the 4- Gbyte boundary, you have to have software that runs in 64-bit mode.  This includes your operating system, your DAW software, your drivers (such as the driver for your digital audio card and any other piece of hardware integrated into your computer), and as many of your VIs as possible.  At the time I was figuring all of this out (18 months ago), there wasn&#8217;t much available that worked in 64-bit mode, and it was unclear how long it would be before the situation improved significantly.<br />
<br />
The first decision to be made was which 64-bit operating system to use.  Should it be <span style="font-style: italic;">Windows</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">XP</span>, with which I was familiar, or <span style="font-style: italic;">Windows Vista</span>, which implemented more leading-edge technology but about which I&#8217;d heard lots of bad press and had even had my own negative experiences?  I was advised to go with <span style="font-style: italic;">Vista Ultimate 64-bit</span>, as XP was seen as a dead-end product and software vendors were designing their products to work under Vista.  Once again, I decided to take a calculated risk &#8211; in this case, that things would work out best over time if I went with Vista.  I made this decision, as well as my choice of computer hardware configuration, in combination with the availability of a convincing level of technical support from the computer&#8217;s vendor, <span style="font-style: italic;">PC Audio Labs</span>.  I&#8217;ve paid extra for that support, but I figured my shot at business success was conditioned upon having a computer that worked well and had minimum downtime, and the extra cost seemed worth it.  Experience has proven me right.<br />
<br />
I decided to use Steinberg&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">Cubase </span>as my DAW, for the following reasons:  1) I was familiar with Cubase, liked the way it worked, and didn&#8217;t want to be tied to dedicated hardware as would have been the case had I chosen a product such as <span style="font-style: italic;">ProTools</span>;  2) I knew Cubase was a relatively mature product but that a 64-bit product was under development;  and 3) I felt that Steinberg&#8217;s pioneering role as developer of the <span style="font-style: italic;">VST </span>(<span style="font-weight: bold;">V</span>irtual <span style="font-weight: bold;">S</span>tudio <span style="font-weight: bold;">T</span>echnology) plug-in standard meant that most VI vendors would be sure their plug-ins worked with Cubase.  At the time of my decision, Steinberg was offering only a &#8220;preview version&#8221; of their 64-bit software (which was later to be introduced on a fully-supported basis with the release of Cubase 5).  This preview version was said to be for those brave souls who needed to be at the bleeding edge of technology.  I figured that while Steinberg was readying a fully-supported 64-bit version, I&#8217;d be coming up the learning curve on a lot of other things.  This conjecture proved to be true, and the timing worked out about right.  I&#8217;m now running 64-bit Cubase 5.1.<br />
<br />
As for virtual instruments from which I can build a complete orchestra, I&#8217;m currently using a combination of products from different vendors.  You hear this combination in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Rite Of Spring</span> examples.<br />
<br />
As I described back in July, I&#8217;m using WIVIs for all of my woodwinds and brass.  Since July, I&#8217;ve only grown happier with the WIVI approach.  I expect my use of WIVIs will expand over the next year or two as new instruments are introduced and existing ones are improved.  One of the biggest positive impacts of the WIVIs is that they use very little RAM, because they&#8217;re based on modeling rather than sampling.  In principle, they also use little CPU.  However, current WIVIs operate only in 32-bit mode, whereas I have a 64-bit environment.  I&#8217;m able to use them through the <span style="font-style: italic;">VST Bridge</span> feature of Cubase.  This works by creating a software wrapper around any 32-bit VST plug-in instance;  the wrapper makes the VST instance appear to Cubase as if it&#8217;s a 64-bit plug-in, and makes Cubase appear to the VST instance as if it&#8217;s a 32-bit DAW.  That&#8217;s great except that VST Bridge adds a surprisingly large amount to the total CPU workload, and the amount added is roughly proportional to the number of 32-bit plug-in instances.  If you have a large number of WIVIs, this can easily add up to the single largest component of CPU usage.  Although I find I can live with the actual amount of CPU load I have in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Rite Of Spring</span>, I&#8217;ve decided to reduce the load by taking advantage of the ability of a WIVI plug-in instance to incorporate more than one virtual instrument.  I&#8217;ve used this technique to reduce the number of WIVI plug-ins by a factor of about 5, relative to the number I&#8217;d have if I put only one instrument in each plug-in instance.  That has brought my <span style="font-style: italic;">Rite Of Spring</span> CPU usage down to about 60% of what it previously was.  More about these numbers later.<br />
<br />
For strings, I&#8217;m using <span style="font-style: italic;">Audiobro</span>&#8217;s recently-introduced <span style="font-style: italic;">LA Scoring Strings</span> (LASS) library.  This is a sample-based library and, depending on how you use it, is quite capable of filling 16 Gbytes of RAM &#8211; which is what I have.  It&#8217;s a good thing my WIVIs don&#8217;t use much RAM!  My standard LASS setup deliberately creates a great deal of flexibility so that I usually have at my disposal what I need without having to pause in the middle of composing to add something that&#8217;s not there.  The downside of this strategy is that it requires a lot of RAM.  If I use LASS&#8217;s 24-bit samples, the amount of RAM used is uncomfortably close to 16 Gbytes.  Thus, for most of my work, I use the 16-bit samples, which cuts several Gbytes from my RAM usage (the <span style="font-style: italic;">Rite Of Spring</span> MP3s were made using LASS&#8217;s 16-bit samples).<br />
<br />
LASS samples are hosted by <span style="font-style: italic;">Kontakt 3.5</span>, which is a recently-introduced, 64-bit version of the Kontakt sampler.  I&#8217;ve been extremely pleased with how well Kontakt 3.5 has worked with the rest of my 64-bit environment &#8211; almost flawlessly.  I use the full version of the Kontakt 3.5 sampler, but you can also use the Kontakt 3.5 player that&#8217;s supplied by Audiobro, along with LASS.<br />
<br />
LASS, by the way, is a fantastic string library and one of the best acquisitions I&#8217;ve made.  Besides the quality of the sound, I especially like the way LASS lets me handle divisi string parts by combining ensembles of different sizes.  Still, I&#8217;ve only scratched the surface of what LASS can do.  But as LASS&#8217;s many positive attributes are not the main focus of this article, I&#8217;ll leave further discussion of those to another day.  There are a few shortcomings.  For example, the initial LASS version includes no col legno samples, which are required by <span style="font-style: italic;">The Rite Of Spring</span>.  For those, I used samples from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sonic Implants String Collection</span>, with good result.  In another case, the tail end of one of the Rite Of Spring examples required samples of cello played <span style="font-style: italic;">marcatissimo</span>, which LASS didn&#8217;t have (there was also a problem of range).  I solved that problem satisfactorily with samples from EWQLSO.<br />
<br />
So far, I&#8217;ve needed only four percussion instruments in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Rite Of Spring</span>.  I addressed all of those needs with samples from EWQLSO, delivered by EastWest&#8217;s 64-bit Play engine.<br />
<br />
In addition to all of the instruments I&#8217;ve described, there are currently 15 reverb instances, one of which is a convolution reverb, and a few equalizers.  There&#8217;s plenty of CPU headroom available for doing more of this type of processing if and when it becomes my focus &#8211; say, to improve the mix.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bottom Lines</span><br />
<br />
In my <span style="font-style: italic;">Rite Of Spring</span> project, I currently have a total of 281 virtual instruments loaded.  The lion&#8217;s share of these (217) are string instruments from the LASS library.  This seemingly large imbalance can be explained by the fact that the LASS instruments are sample-based and have separate samples (which I&#8217;m counting as separate instruments) for the various articulations that are supported.  On the wind side, in contrast, all of the instruments are WIVIs, which, by nature, don&#8217;t have multiple articulations.  Instead, you get different sounds by varying the many model parameters but chiefly by the way you apply the MIDI breath control (CC2).  In any case, it&#8217;s never the case that all 281 instruments are playing at the same time.  The total is probably closer to something in the range from 50 to 75 instruments playing simultaneously.  The number of simultaneous <span style="font-style: italic;">voices </span>playing, however, can be several times this figure.<br />
<br />
These 281 instruments are using about 12.5 Gbytes of RAM.  Given the 3.5 Gbytes left over, I&#8217;m happy to report that with everything loaded, the system shows no sluggishness of interactive response;  thus, it&#8217;s very easy to work on <span style="font-style: italic;">The Rite Of Spring</span> in Cubase.  So far, it hasn&#8217;t been necessary to conserve RAM by resorting to any <span style="font-style: italic;">track freezing</span> or, in the case of samples hosted by Kontakt 3 (such as the LASS samples), <span style="font-style: italic;">sample purging</span>.  These factors are important, because they translate directly into increased productivity. The main adverse consequence of having so much sample data in RAM is that it takes a long time to load and unload projects.  Loading typically takes about 8 to 10 minutes, and unloading between 1 and 2 minutes.  These long times create a disincentive to switching projects &#8211; I&#8217;ve compensated for this by attempting to have everything I need in the loaded project.<br />
<br />
Cubase includes a disk activity monitor that seems to suggest that even when the full orchestra is playing the most intensive passages I&#8217;ve so far encountered in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Rite Of Spring</span>, the main sample drive &#8211; the one built using the four Raptors in a RAID-0 array &#8211;  isn&#8217;t breaking a sweat.  It doesn&#8217;t even register on the meter, except at the start of playing.  I&#8217;ve never heard a pop that&#8217;s characteristic of a disk (or CPU or motherboard) that can&#8217;t keep up.  This suggests that I might be able to reduce the amount of RAM I&#8217;m using by reducing the value of the RAM pre-load size parameter in Kontakt 3.5.  This would demand more from the disk, but the disk seems to have a lot more to give.  We&#8217;ll see.<br />
<br />
CPU load and its distribution across the 8 CPU cores can be effectively monitored using the Performance tab of the Task Manager built into Windows Vista.  This monitor shows that during playback of The Rite Of Spring, CPU usage is distributed fairly uniformly among the 8 cores, peaks in the 30% to 35% range in the most intensive passages, and runs from 20% to 25% in less-demanding passages.<br />
<br />
All of these observations add up to the overall conclusion that the system is easily meeting its performance objectives with comfortable margin when handling full-orchestra, real-time playback of complex orchestration.  Given all the blood, sweat, and tears that have gone into getting this far, that&#8217;s welcome news indeed.  And if you&#8217;ve ever wondered whether these big systems really work &#8211; you have your answer.<br />
<br />
Could I have gotten by with less?  Perhaps.  But I think that, one way or another, lesser solutions would have exacted painful costs in terms of productivity and/or compromises in the types of material I could attempt to compose.  My goal has been to minimize those costs whenever possible, and it looks like I&#8217;ve succeeded.<br />
<br />
Despite all the things I&#8217;ve said in this rather long-winded article, there are many topics I&#8217;ve omitted.  So if I&#8217;ve raised any burning questions in your mind, either technical or artistic, please make a comment and I&#8217;ll try to fill the gaps.  Meanwhile, I hope I&#8217;ve provided you with one possible roadmap to a system that just might be able to support your dream workflow.<br />

We're often housed in a facility full of computers, with a cell phone strapped to our belt and a bagged laptop under the desk. Yet we're still surprised when a session runs long and we miss a meeting, an email goes unanswered or we lose a time window to return an important call at a respectable hour. Sometimes assistants can help avoid such pratfalls. But just like most composers can't afford a full-time orchestrator, copyist or conductor - we often must be our own personal assistant, even when there's an actual person filling that role several days per week. With that, even in a world of email, cell phones and social networking, many creatives bristle at the idea of using time management tools. "Give me Post-It Notes&#174; or give me death!" Unfortunately, the risks and rewards often aren't fully considered - which inevitably translates to unseen <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">opportunity costs</span>.<br /><br />I was introduced to this concept during my days in the financial world. Even though that's where it originated, it has filtered out into other fields of study, including project and time management. In it's original form, it can reveal the difference between, for example, putting money in a certificate of deposit versus investing the same cash in the stock market. There are many factors that go into valuing that gap, and in most cases it's impossible to know all of factors that make the end result completely accurate. However it's the process of discovering all that <span style="font-style: italic;">can </span>be known that makes the evaluation worthwhile (and ultimately may impact the final decision). So let's look at a simple example of how that applies to the composer.<br /><br />You're up late at night writing a "quick" email to a director that you promised to call earlier in the day. But instead of just covering the salient points, you're caught up trying to craft the pre-amble to your email explaining (read: apologizing) why you didn't call earlier as agreed - while trying to <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">not </span>look like a jerk or an idiot. Instead of having a full conversation, you're only having half of the exchange - because you're writing an email, after all. So now you're at risk of over or under-informing and coming off as either a boor or a flake. So what should have been a five-minute phone exchange earlier in the day has now turned into a late-night 20-minute writing/editing expedition with you <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">not </span>at your mental best. (don't deny it - we've all done it) And even if you're the black belt master ninja of email composition and can effortlessly, accurately and concisely sum your thoughts in the form of haiku - unless you're also telepathic you've still only accomplished <span style="font-style: italic;">half </span>of the conversation.<br /><br />At some point you're going to be repeating the same information again in a later conversation with the same director who's not only irritated that it's a day late, but she also <span style="font-style: italic;">hates </span>haiku. The penalty depends on the scenario. It could simply be time wasted that could have been spent sleeping. Was the conversation to be a simple status check, or was it to discuss whether or not to use you on the project? Maybe since you missed the follow-up call you gave the director the impression that they're not as important (rightly or wrongly) as the project you're currently working on, and they've spent the intervening time looking for a replacement. Perhaps the call was was to discuss expanding the music budget to hire live players, but instead the director bought a new system for their edit bay. There's a chance the email itself managed to steer the conversation into an unproductive direction, and now you get to extend the follow-up call in back-tracking with a potentially confused and most-likely agitated director. Or maybe it was to discuss working on the next project - which might have been in jeopardy before you even hit "Send" on that late night email. And of course it's possible that the decision was made before you missed yesterday's phone call - and none of it would have mattered even if you had done everything right and on time. And that, my friends, is typical of opportunity cost. It can be maddening to work through all of the permutations, but in most cases it can show where a few small actions early on could have forestalled many of these potentially negative outcomes.<br /><br />So let's look at a few examples of how technology could have saved us from this scenario. Fortunately we're in a world where the tools are all around us, but in many cases the appropriate features go unused.<br /><br />First is the mobile phone itself - many of them have a calendar function that can work in a pinch. Simply set an event that brings up a one-word reminder. Even if you typically switch your phone off during studio sessions, you can simply set most phones to "flight mode" instead, which keeps it on while preventing calls and text messages from disturbing your session. The reminder pops up (with a polite sound or vibrate notification) and you know to "come up for air" and switch your phone on and make the call. Disaster averted - all while keeping your conscience clear so you can focus on the music completely during the intervening time.<br /><br />You can also use online collaboration tools like Google's toolkit. Their calendar function is very well thought out and easy to use. You can set up multiple calendars, and even share them privately with other Gmail users (who <span style="font-style: italic;">doesn't</span> have a Gmail account these days?) which can be a big help when working on a long project (or a series of small ones) across a diverse group. The best part is that it's ad-supported, so it feels like a "free" app, it's reasonably secure and it all runs through a web browser and can synchronize to other applications and mobile devices. Even if your DAW is not connected to the web, you can use that laptop under your desk to log into Gmail's Calendar and create and update to-do lists and set events that can even notify you via text messaging. And if you have a part-time assistant you can assign tasks for them through their Gmail account as well as keep an eye on following-up on tasks that should already be "in the books". Both Apple and Microsoft have their various incarnations of the same functionality - both in the box and online. Even media companies are beginning to get the picture by adding project/task management features to media and collaboration apps. Virtual Katy's <a href="http://www.virtualkaty.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=57&amp;Itemid=179">VKorus </a>is one good example of audio post tools "growing up". And when I worked for a large industrial scale post production house, I was part of a team that helped design a solution centered on Microsoft's Project Server, which connected work flow tools from each person's Outlook email client (and often their mobile phones) to scheduling tasks for specific editors and bays, all the way to automatically updating customers at the various studios, end-to-end. So in that case it was a matter of bending a general scheduling tool to the purposes of a media giant. But of course you don't have to go to those lengths in order to operate with new efficiency. The point is to use what's at hand and of value, and make use of it consistently. Then when the needs change it's a matter of scaling to a different tool, instead of struggling with trying to build and understand a new process.<br /><br />This is another concept borrowed from the tech world that applies equally here - the <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Pareto Principal</span>. You've probably heard it a million times - the 80-20 rule; 20% of the effort often yields 80% of the benefit - and that certainly applies here. When thinking about scaling up your task management process, it's easy to feel overwhelmed and excuse yourself from dealing with it by thinking "that's the contractor's/my assistant's/my spouse's job" - when in reality the buck stops with <span style="font-weight: bold;">*you*</span>. Fortunately you can start with tools as close at-hand as your belt clip and keep it to the basics.<br /><br />I began merging some of my IT practices to the media world with the most mundane of tasks. I started to put the dates of monthly bills on my Outlook calendar and synchronized it to my phone's calendar. I'd get a beep first thing in the morning to remind me to make an online payment, check that a deduction was completed the night before - or even go old-school and actually write a check and put a stamp on an envelope to drop in the out box. It's a really trivial thing, but it can be a huge weight off your shoulders to <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">not </span>carry around that handful of regular action items in your head. So as other "opportunities" presented themselves, I found ways to offload those tasks to a device that functions as a "digital" personal assistant. I started to add a few important calendar items for events - like a reminder to swing by the local dry cleaner before they closed the next day to pick up my good shirt and slacks for a red carpet event later that evening. And of course there's making sure you're on time and on-task with your principals, as well as those you employ that need to have their materials ready on time. As much as you want to look sharp to those that hired you, it's nearly as important to stay organized (and follow up) with those you employ.<br /><br />And while I believe that there's more to scheduling than "accidental" project management, one size does <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">not </span>fit all. A very good example where a framework simply didn't fit was the audition that Deane, Lee and I submitted for a major television show. (see podcast No 22 for a one-hour de-brief on lessons learned from that) It initially looked like the audition process would transpire over the course of a few weeks, where we'd each roll off of individual projects at different times, and work on our individual cues to be submitted in one kit at the end of that period. This seemed like the perfect opportunity to use the collaborative tools on Gmail to keep things like a cue list in the shared docs area, and track individual status on cues as they were "burned down" in each composer's studio. As well as this has worked for me in the past for me, it pretty much collapsed in a day or two. One of the major reasons was that  the submission date was much closer than we had originally understood. So we went from <span style="font-style: italic;">"we'll get to it when we can and meet in a couple of weeks"</span> to <span style="font-style: italic;">"drop everything and do it *now*!"</span> So we dropped everything and reverted to a litany of email exchanges and occasional conference calls on Skype/iChat. There were some problems with that fallback approach, in that some important emails got lost in the shuffle, and with the compressed schedule that created more drama that would have normally occurred. So there were definitely lessons learned on that front that will likely inform any future collabs [read, keep Skype/iChat during crunch time and forgo the email].<br /><br />By contrast, a really basic practice recently saved my bacon on getting a project done. I was doing sound design and mix on a webisode and late in the schedule the director found out that some source music wouldn't clear in time for it to air. I offered to replace the cue with a vibe-alike, but the clock was ticking. The concerns were around finding players, getting the right tone for the song and of course fitting everything into the show with the right edits and cuts. So I offered to mock up as much as I could of "the vibe" in four hours and promised to get back to the director. So I set up a reminder on my phone, switched it to flight mode and shut out the rest of the world. I'm really glad I did that, because those four hours felt like they went by in five minutes. I sent up a quick intro, verse and chorus of my "take" on the parody tune and he loved it. That was the good news. The bad news was that I knew that we'd blow the schedule at the rate I was going, particularly if we were going to try and bring in live players to flesh out the band in time to record vocals the next day. The director and co-writer were to come over the with the show's composer to figure out how to work in original lyrics and sing the parts. Then I had to make time to mix the song <span style="font-style: italic;">and </span>mix a cut of that song into a montage in the episode. Looking at the burn rate and what had to be done, we decided to make some compromises.<br /><br />First of all, we decided to write just the segments of the song that actually made it into the show. That meant a bit of extra work on my part to export the cue and tempo-match a new project file to the exported segments - but it saved us a ton of time by letting us focus on the parts of the song that were to air. Then the next decision was made to keep all of the parts virtual. I made an initial furtive call around to a few players that I knew, but there simply weren't enough hours to put everything together and it didn't seem worthwhile to bring in a player for 40 seconds worth of music. So, I stayed with virtual guitar parts and a drum machine that I programmed myself. Fortunately the task was to do a parody song - so a layer of virtual Velveeta from pre-canned bass, drums and guitar actually helped the tune out. So the recording and mix session went without a hitch - and everything made it into the episode with a day to spare. Parts of the song worked out so well the director actually put a repeat of the lead into the chorus as the music for the credits at the end of the show - a bit of a nod that things turned out as well (or perhaps better) than we all expected. Now fans of the show are asking for an mp3 of a full-length version of the tune - not bad, considering where we were three days before the final cut was submitted to the network. So in this case, a very simple task management tool not only kept me in good stead with the director, but it also gave us a clear window into what we were actually going to be able to accomplish in the remaining time. It's all too easy to over-estimate our ability to deliver, so a minuscule aside like setting a reminder on a cell phone can bring a welcome dose of reality, and likewise can radically improve how you're perceived as a professional.<br /><br />Let's face it - while technology is constantly advancing, composers tend to pick and choose their spots when keeping up with the times. In each case, the composer usually has a set of justifications for whichever way the decision falls. There are situations where the status quo is paramount, and every effort is made to keep changes in the studio to an absolute minimum. By contrast, sometimes we feel that we "need" to have *that* sound from the newest/hottest piece of software or hardware - which means taking on a series of updates and upgrades even in the middle of a project. Just like any other business, it comes down to balancing perceived risk and reward. But that measure is usually skewed by what interests us. And either by accident or design, personal schedule management  is an area that often gets ignored because it can seem too boring or complicated.<br /><br />But I hope that I've shown a few examples where the subject can be approached in smaller "bites", and I hope that readers will also chime in with their insights and experiences with various tools and processes. Let's hear it, Scorecast readers!

Hope you're <i>laboring</i> on something inspiring and energizing.<br />
<div>In the true spirit of WP, it's time to take some potshots at this month's theme.<br />
<br />
Provocation:&nbsp;<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Composers should work without schedules and/or budgets.</span><br />
<b><br />
</b><br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">&#8230;obvious, right? Turning the whole thing on its head and seeing what shakes out before we get too far into this month's (sure-to-be-<i>killer</i>) content.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">Schedules and budgets are what keep us in line. They routine our work hours; they constrain our dreams of 100-piece orchestras. But maybe, just maybe, there's something valuable in considering what might be&#8230; if we weren't so constrained. One that strikes me straightaway is this: <i>Filmmakers don't care about your gear</i>.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">If you're working with a Casio keyboard and a 4-track, you'll still be subjected to a straight A-B comparison with people who have banks and banks of humming machinery (not to mention orchestras) to bring to bear on the task of making music. So in this sense, you <i>must</i> create a product that is without schedule or budget. That doesn't apologize for its limitations.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">What else does this provocation bring to mind? I can't wait to read your thoughts&#8230; jump in and let's make it an <i>active</i> holiday weekend here at SCOREcast!</span></span><br />
<br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">(P.S. If you've commented here and you're still jonesing to make your voice heard, check out Brian Satterwhite's excellent&#8212;and very provocative&#8212;<a href="2009/09/why-does-film-need-music.html">article</a>. I'd love to read everyone's thoughts on that one, as well).</span></span></div></div>

We certainly have a fundamental awareness (either conscious or sub-conscious) of its physical, psychological and technical purposes, but could you come up with a wholly encompassing explanation as to why its there in the first place? <br /><br />I was inspired by Lee's call-to-action a couple weeks ago where he tasked the readership to participate in a little compositional exercise. I'd like to follow suit with a little collective pow-wow myself. <br /><br />Before I dive in and wax poetic about my own formulated explanation of why music is a necessary ingredient in motion picture storytelling, I'd like to ask all of you to weigh in first. Take your best shot at deriving a universal explanation behind the fundamental need for music in film. Reduce the function of film music to its lowest common denominator. Be succinct, yet as comprehensive as possible.<br /><br />After a week or so passes, I'll follow up with my own thoughts. There are no right or wrong answers here. It's simply a measure of recognizing the foundation of the craft of film scoring based on the collective input from a variety of viewpoints. Anybody harboring a love of movies should have an interesting vantage point to contribute. <br /><br />So...I'll ask it again.<br /><br />Why does film need music?</div>

Where do budgets even come from? You have to have money, right?<br />
<br />
I'm not rich for doing this yet, by any means, so I'm going to talk about how to get to the place where you are creating some cash and starting to carve a spot in the film music business.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow, I start my final year at USC. Because of that, today is my last day of full-time work at my current place of employment, Deane Ogden Music. This has easily been the best job I've had since moving to Los Angeles in 2004 and I will miss it greatly. Deane has generously taught me things about how to be a great composer and how to treat the people that you work with like royalty, and his influence on me is deep - I will miss hanging out with him, working alongside him, and watching a master craftsman accomplish his work.<br />
<br />
Deane and Lee have asked me to stay on as managing editor of SCOREcastOnline.com, a position I accepted with a big fat smile on my face. One of the greatest things I've ever done in my life is have a hand in  the creation of such a fabulous community of people as SCOREcast. We should not take lightly the generosity these two guys have shown in building this resource for all of us.<br />
<br />
Last night, I was thinking about my career thusfar and how far I have come, and it was pretty overwhelming. Sometimes when you feel like you aren't moving forward as quickly as you'd like to be, and then you write down everything you've accomplished so far, you realize you've done a lot. I've had people ask me why I haven't struck out on my own yet as a composer and the truth is I just feel like I'm not ready to fly solo quite yet. I'm giving it another few months.<br />
<br />
Because of the importance of the day, I'm in a bit of a sentimental mood. I wanted to get some thoughts down to you guys about my experiences so far. I'm not sure where I'm going with this, so it might not follow any kind of formal format, but they are my thoughts, nonetheless. I think they are worth something.<br />
<br />
I've been a studio scoring assistant for several years now, all while working my way through school at USC. My advisers have told me that the way I'm doing it is right - to take it easy while I'm in school  before I get out there on my own, instead of trying to squeak by and scrimp and save as a student. Instead, I've decided to learn as much as I possibly can from people who are actually making a living in the film music business - composers who have "hit it" in terms of finding a way to live comfortably and stay successful over the long haul.<br />
<br />
But man... it has been a long journey. Under my current composer, SCOREcast founder <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1676420/" rel="imdb" title="Deane Ogden">Deane Ogden</a>, I've learned a ton. I also worked at Remote Control for quite awhile and that was an education all in itself. I work hard at learning this craft, and I would heartily recommend that anyone who is considering a career in film music assist a composer for a time before you launch out on your own. It will give you a head start that can not be obtained in any other way.<br />
<br />
It kind of sounds mean, but the truth is that you can short-cut a lot of bullshit by watching someone else find their way through something. However, that is the essence of assisting - yes, you are there to help pull off something that maybe cannot be pulled off as a solo act, but for YOU, there is an education in front of you that should not be taken for granted. The fact that you can learn by seeing every possible situation come about without getting any of it on you, per se, is priceless.<br />
<br />
Here are a few things, and a few stories, from my experience.<br />
<br />
<b>Compensation</b><br />
First of all,  do not expect to make a fortune working as an assistant. I started out as an intern at Remote Control working for school credit, assisting several A-list and B-list (several who are <i>now</i> A-list) composers. I spent a lot of time orchestrating and programming. The first time I made any money was toward the end of my first year there working on the music team for the film "<a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399201/" rel="imdb" title="The Island (2005 film)">The Island</a>" with composer Steve Jablonsky. I wrote several arrangements for some of the source music on the film, not a very glamorous first job, but I was so happy to finally be making some cash doing anything musically related.<br />
<br />
The first time I earned a solid wage (and by <i>solid</i>, I simply mean <i>consistent</i>) as an assistant wasn't until a year after "The Island" when I began working on the music team for "Pirates of the Caribbean II and III". I made $15 an hour working on those two films as an assistant to several composers under the Remote Control roof. <br />
<br />
Basically, there is no good answer to the question of compensation since the art of "assisting" is still relatively new in our business. It's odd, but even though technology has supposedly made things better for composers, the learning curve has created an entirely new role that is now necessary for film composers to fill - programmers and assistants.<br />
<br />
<b>Schedules</b><br />
The hours on the "Pirates" gigs were ridiculous... sometimes 16 or 17 hour days for weeks straight. I was paid every other week. Sometimes I'd work in upwards of 20 hours a day, only sleeping an hour here and an hour there. It was brutal. Since working for Deane, I might work 30 hours a week. BIG difference. Truth be told, working at Deane's is completely different work than working anywhere else I have worked. Laid back, clear cut, no drama, precise. I know what my job is and I know what is expected. That is important when you are assisting. It still amazes me how most composers have zero idea what to have their assistants do every day, and a lot of time is wasted daily because of that. Since I started working for Deane, I've been able to write the scores to a few of my pals' student films, experience that I wouldn't have been able to find if I was still working a job that required 90+ hours a week of my time.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, Deane wrote a fabulous <a href="2009/09/balanced-composer.html">article</a> for SCOREcast about balancing family with work. I've had this to contend with also, and I think I've done well. I have a beautiful wife and a sweet 1 year-old baby girl. We have plenty of time together even though I am in school and working a full-time job. This year, I will only have school to finish up, and I'm really looking forward to major time at home. Deane has been great, and during his downtime, he has given me blocks of time off that I've used to my advantage with my family.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I come in at 8AM, other times I don't get in until after lunch. Deane doesn't care as long as I get my work done. I have a punch list, and if it is done by the end of the day, what time I arrive doesn't matter. If he has a meeting in the morning, I will start work earlier so that things are covered while he's gone. If it is crunch time, well... we are in for the long haul until the project is finished. My family just knows that I'm under it for however long it takes.<br />
<br />
<b>Duties</b><br />
I've done so many things for composers: studio rewires, software upgrades, additional composing, car washes, clothes shopping (yes!), and more. I'll tell you, I even was asked once by a composer that I was working  for to go pick up the dog doo in his yard while he took a phone call. This composer happened to be known for his practical joking, so I innocently asked, "Really? Are you joking  or are you serious?" He put his hands in the air and yelled, "Do I look like I'm f*cking joking? GO!"<br />
<br />
I <i>did</i> go...  and after I was done picking up after the dog, I just kept going and never went back. The icing on the cake was months later, and I had moved on to working for Deane. Deane took me with him to a   BMI event and we ran into Poop Guy at the bar. He either didn't remember who I was, or he was too embarrassed to say "hi" to me. Deane said it was probably the latter... and to not worry... "I don't have a dog... or a yard!", he said with smile.<br />
<br />
<b>Professionalism</b><br />
I've also had the opportunity to work with a lot of great directors while assisting composers. Directors can be very difficult to work with, or they can be easy as hell. I've dealt with both, and I've seen how composers deal with them, too. Some do a great job at appeasing directors and getting them what they want, and some don't do so hot.<br />
<br />
One time, I was working for a composer who was doing a cue on spec for a film that he really wanted to score. The film was a huge one (you would know it by name), and he was very excited that he was even being considered for the job.&nbsp; After demoing for the job with this spec cue, we received word that we would not be working on this film. My composer was pissed. He got up after the call came in, picked up a chair that was next to his desk, and threw it into a rack of (luckily) old defunct gear. The rack fell over and everything cascaded onto the floor. Guess who got to pick *that* up?!<br />
<br />
I've always found it interesting that even to the big guys, not getting the gig is as frustrating as getting it is exciting. Unfortunately, often times acting like a dumbass comes just as easy as acting honorably and professionally does to others.<br />
<br />
In contrast,  I worked for Graeme Revell for a time. I was in the room when he found out he didn't get a gig he was up for. After hanging up the phone, he looked at me, shrugged his shoulders and said, "Well... that one's out of our way!" Pure class.<br />
<br />
<b>Conclusion</b><br />
I will tell some more good stories as the month continues. I have plenty and I don't want to blow them all in one shot. Believe me, I can entertain at parties with this stuff. But one thing is for sure, I love this work, I love the people I've worked with, and I cannot wait to get through the next season of my life and get on to composing some films of my own.<br />

Several of us will be guest-posting on Scott's behalf until his triumphant return! - JM</i><br />
<br />
I'm pretty happy and honored to get to step in for Mr. Stambler as the inaugural columnist for September's theme of Budgeting and Scheduling. Scott is hard at work on a major studio feature right now and is "up to his neck" as he put it, so I told him I'd fill his slot with something beneficial. Filling Scott's shoes is no easy task, so with a little luck and a lot of forgiveness from you guys, we might make it through this! :op <br />
<br />
I'm going to tackle a topic right off the bat that I've wanted to talk about for a long time. Out of everything I've ever written for SCOREcastOnline.com or said on the SCOREcast podcasts, this topic is the one that is dearest to me personally and one that I think is imperative that composers get right. In fact, this topic is at the very core of who I am, not only as a composer, but also a human being.<br />
<br />
People have asked me what drives me in my pursuit of film music and the career path I've chosen. It is complicated and would require much more than the allotted space here can provide, but in short, there are two answers. The first one is that I was born for this and I don't know how to do anything else as well as I know how to do music. Yes, I am a great businessman. Yes, if I wanted to, I could produce movies as I have before and am completely capable of doing so. Yes, I am also a comfortable communicator and have spoken to crowds of thousands before with ease. I AM good at all of those things. Am I as good at them as I am composing music? No. Do any of those things make me happy like writing film music does? Absolutely not.<br />
<br />
The second answer to this question is my <u><i>family</i></u>. Working how we work as composers can be difficult. Some of us have chosen to work away from the house, while others of us have chosen to work within the home. Notice I do not say "some of us have the <i>luxury</i> of an outside studio", because frankly, I don't consider that a luxury - I consider it a <i>choice</i>. While I might enjoy a different atmosphere having my studio away from my home, that does not mean that it is necessarily a better deal for me as a composer or for my family, either.<br />
<br />
To me, there are great benefits to working from the house, only one of which is knowing your brood is upstairs or downstairs or in the other room doing there thing while you work on your projects. That being said, working from home can also be the death of your career if you don't know how to handle it properly.<br />
<br />
And <i>that</i> is what I would like us to dialog about. What do you do if your scenario is that of needing to have your studio at home but still treat your music business as just that... a business?<br />
<br />
Listen... this gig is not for everybody, and it especially is not for <u><i>every family</i></u>. It is a hard and bitter pill to swallow, but if you don't have a spouse that supports this gig and your dream of a career in this gig, you are in for a world of hurt. Believe me. (By the way, if you don't believe me, go ahead and try it with your unbelieving spouse and then come talk to me in six months. I'll go ahead and tell you now in advance that you are welcome to  sleep on my couch.)<br />
<br />
Scoring pictures is the musical version of training to become an Olympic athlete. You need people on your side that believe in you and are willing to live under a bridge, if it comes to that, to see you fulfill your dreams. Anything less, and you will not make it. Period. It's just not possible to do it without support. It <i>used</i> to be, but it isn't anymore. This business is one of the only ones I ever seen that functions almost solely on exclusivity, and if everyone that is *for* you isn't invested 100%, it will never work. That is why you hear people always talk about how critical it is to find the right agent or manager. If the people who are supposed to be in your corner are rolling their eyes behind your back, they are literally sabotaging any chance you have of breaking through the initial first line of defense.<br />
<br />
After years and years of doing this, and having moved my studio out of my home, back into my home, out of it again, back in again, and out yet again... I think I know a thing or two about how to best pull this off without compromising time with your family or ever feeling like you are neglecting them in any way.<br />
<br />
But before we examine some of the things that you should definitely NOT do when trying to balance your work life with home life,  let's look at a few things that need to be in place before you can consider the possibility. These things are non-negotiables and must be working already if you are going to expect to achieve any success as a stay-at-home composer.<br />
<br />
<b>Make sure YOU are 100% into this gig. </b>Forget your family &#8212; if YOU aren't into this gig with both feet planted you are never going to make it work. How can your family be supportive of something that is tying up household resources, monopolizing all of your time, and not earning the family any immediate money when your heart isn't in it? The truth is that there are easier jobs out there that are far less humiliating and don't demand anything but a 9 to 5 schedule. Go get one.<br />
<br />
<b>Make sure you are in this gig for the right reasons.</b> Composing for picture is hard, tough, and often thankless work. If you have an inferiority complex or are seeking approval from people who, in your mind, you've replaced your parents with... #1, you have issues, and #2, this ain't gonna work. You'd better be in this game with no other motive than than the fact that you love music and you love movies. If you love music, but you don't love movies, then go be a concert composer and write symphonies. If you love movies, but you don't love music, well then... become a director. (C'mon... I kid because I love!)<br />
<b><br />
</b><br />
<b>Make sure that you are in this gig with the right resources. </b>Quitting your day job as a brain surgeon to start a career as a composer is probably not the best of ideas. I hate the supposed statistic that <i>there are more composers than there are jobs for composers</i> (for a lot of reasons, but mostly because it is a complete fabrication), but there is an underlying cautionary lesson there that bears attention: This is a tough game, and only a narrow few make what would be considered a successful living at it.<br />
<br />
If you are quitting your day job to be a composer and you have nothing built up in terms of a financial nest-egg to get your family through the drought period while you find your first several paying (!) jobs, thus causing them to suffer right along with you, you aren't going to be very popular at the dinner table. Your family is NOT the group of people that deserve to live wondering if they are going to eat or not while dad or mom tries to work out how to "break in" to the industry. As much of a "Duh!" statement as that is, I'm telling you I've seen this a million times, and it never ends well. Be sure that you are taking care of what is important first &#8212; your family &#8212; and THEN working through your plan to launch this new career. Not the other way around. Find some way of generating alternate income to support your habit of composing until you can quit lying to everyone and turn it into a full-time job. (Saying "I'm a professional composer" but not making any money at it makes you just a "composer".... not a "professional" one.)<br />
<br />
<br />
I could go on and on and on about what needs to be in place BEFORE you start even considering this career as a reality, but let's move on to a few basic rules to keep in mind if you are.<b>&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
<b>RULE #1: Film Does Not Wait</b><br />
<b><span style="font-weight: normal;">I'm starting with the most important rule in the book. In fact, this might be the only one you need if you are able to live by the "one rule to rule them all" philosophy that my family lives by.</span></b><br />
<br />
Look, unless you started this gig when you were still in the womb (don't laugh... some of us did!), then most likely your family at some point has forced themselves to come to terms with your "crazy dreams" and accept the fact that they aren't going to be seeing you much when you are on a film. The biggest thing your family needs to understand and "be with" is... Everyone say it with me... <i><u>FILM</u> <u>DOES</u> <u>NOT</u> <u>WAIT</u></i>.<br />
<br />
When a filmmaker hires you to score their picture, they don't care if your kid gets sick. <i>Is the score done?</i> They don't give a damn if your car breaks down or the water pipes broke in the bathroom this morning. <i>Are you finished yet?</i> They don't want to hear that the reason why you are late to your playback meeting with them is because you had to drop the wife off at work and then the kids off at grandma's on your way. <i>You're bringing the mock-ups, right?</i><br />
<br />
Your family needs to understand that every single minute you <i>aren't</i> writing music is one more minute of stress you <i>are</i> going to have to undergo at the end of the project cycle. If they cannot get their heads wrapped around that, OR worse, if they constantly make you feel guilty for spending all of your time in your studio and no time with them, then do yourself a big fat huge favor... and be a school bus driver. Those people get up early, work for a few hours, and are home by eleven to watch Judge Judy reruns. If you have felt this kind of pressure from your family at any point in your film career... sorry but, this <i>ain't</i> the gig for you.<br />
<br />
<u><i>Solution: </i></u><br />
Your family, and particularly your spouse or your significant other, should be your "Gatekeeper". My girlfriend is mine, and she literally runs our home and everything associated with it while I'm busy in the studio. She might not know what a quarter note is, and she might not care what Command-7 does in Logic Studio, but she knows one thing, and it is all I need her to know: <u><i>Film Does Not Wait</i></u>. She knows this so well, in fact, that she will not let anything in the outside world <i>touch</i> me until I emerge from that studio and declare something to the effect of "I'm taking a break!" Even then, she will often not tell me of things she knows will throw me off track, because she understands the importance of keeping my "head in the game". She knows that I am in a zone and that I cannot be bothered with outside situations or circumstances. Many times, I don't know about fairly major family melt-downs until my live scoring dates are completed because she knows that life is not going to grind to a halt simply because someone had to go to the hospital or because we need to have the hot water heater replaced. She does know, however, that life <i>will</i> grind to a halt if a director is pissed because I promised a cue on a certain date and didn't get it done because I was busy dealing with pediatricians and plumbers!<br />
<br />
Another thing that bears mentioning is that my manager and my girlfriend work together to protect me on all fronts from outside intrusions. They coordinate with each other to make sure that everything is taken care of at home (girlfriend) and in my business (manager) so that I can focus on cranking out X-number of minutes a day.<br />
<br />
I liken this to having a force-field or a shield of protection around me when I come out of the studio. Every composer who lives with someone else needs to have this in place or I PROMISE YOU... you <u><i>will</i></u> suffer down the road without it. It's just eventual.<br />
<br />
Like I said at the beginning of this section: This rule might be the only one you need to have in place. My family and I have been at this for so long that it's really the only one that we need to keep fresh in order for everything else to fall inline.<br />
<br />
<b>RULE #2: Hang the Sign</b><br />
In addition to being a film composer, I also am a studio drummer for a lot of Top 40 artists. It is a wonderful gig that I've enjoyed all my life, but it means I have to  travel a lot. Traveling is not always fun, but it is part and parcel to what I do and I've learned to enjoy it and make the best of it. The thing that I hate the most about being on the road is living out of a suitcase and being in a different hotel every night. The thing that I love the most about hotels is the "Do Not Disturb" sign. That thing saves my life. Call me crazy, but there isn't much in life to me that is better than holing up in a place where nobody knows you are at and hanging that freakin' sign on the outside doorknob. "Ahhhh!!! True peace!"<br />
<br />
Now, wouldn't life as a composer be perfect if you had a sign that you could hang on the doorknob of your home studio? Well, there might not be a sign like that, but there needs to be an understanding in place. You will not be a very successful composer if you are constantly getting bombarded by your children looking for daddy or mommy or if your spouse is always wanting you to come help bring the groceries in from the car. Nothing will break your creative cycle quicker that being pulled away from your workstation in mid-thought. Over time, these little breaks in the stream of consciousness will eventually add up to cues not getting written, or even worse... cues getting written in a hurry at the end of the schedule. Not zesty.<br />
<br />
<u><i>Solution:</i></u><br />
Make sure that your family knows that when "this door is closed, unless someone is on fire or bleeding from the eyes, you are NOT home". Your family just needs to have that agreement as an understanding.<br />
<br />
An alternative to this agreement (because we all know how little kids are!) is to have an understanding that between the hours of (blank) and (blank), they need to pretend that you are just simply not home. At noon or 1pm or whatever, you will be home to have lunch with the family (what's the point in being at home if you aren't going to spend ANY time with them?) and everyone can see you then.<br />
<br />
And this is just a personal pet peeve of mine, so forgive me, BUT... it might be nice to have your studio at home, but if you *really* don't need to, then why do it? Why make it hard on your kids to have you in the next room if you are never going to  come out? Get a backbone, pony up the dough for an outside location, and <u><i>go</i></u> to your studio when you are working. Then at least your kids won't be confused when you are yelling at them to stop bouncing the ball in the house while "daddy's working".<br />
<br />
<b>RULE #3: Formulate Your Plan and Don't Deviate</b><br />
Okay... so the project has landed on your hard drives and you are looking at the next two weeks that you've been given to write the score.<br />
<br />
Well, if you are like me, the first thing you'll do after you poop your pants (!) is try and figure out how you are going to pull this all off and make it sound great with only 224 of actual quality work hours available (remember, you DO have to sleep, and if you think you don't, your body will eventually <i>make</i> you!).<br />
<br />
This is that critical point where a lot of composers fail before they even begin. Even if they go on to write a half-way decent score, the ever-so-slight hesitation here is a killer that will snuff out whatever creative fire was there at the outset. No plan for finishing strong in at this juncture will screw you in the end.<br />
<br />
<u><i>Solution:</i></u><br />
You need to have a process for scoring a film in place BEFORE you are given the film to score. Now, obviously, this is difficult if you have never scored a film on your own before, but if that is the case, a great place to start is SCOREcastOnline.com. We all have scored films before, so get on here, ask questions, get some opinions, steal our tricks, and start formulating a system so that when you are handed the baton, you can hit the ground running.<br />
<br />
Stephen Covey calls this strategy "beginning with the end in mind". He says that to really complete a task or a project (and do it to the best of your ability) it is best to start with the visualized version of the final product... and then work backwards. Ask yourself all of the questions necessary to get to the finished product in the allotted time that you have been given, and then execute them one by one. In no time, you'll realize that when you have a plan and a process by which to organize your thoughts in preparation for scoring a film, the actual scoring goes smoother with less headaches then the alternative.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lastly, I'll give you a few things that I do to guarantee that my family stays happy and healthy in the face of my film schedule, which  rules their lives as much as it does mine (remember rule #1?).<br />
<br />
<b>Schedule regular family time, and don't miss it.</b> Make sure that every day you have a set time that your family knows you are going to be with them and <u><i>only</i></u> them. This is their time. Nobody else gets this time but them. This time is reserved for only them. Are you sensing the theme here? And make sure you never miss this time with them. They are looking forward to this, and letting <i>it</i> go is letting <i>them</i> down. I never miss lunch with my girlfriend. Ever. Every single day, we go and have lunch together. We talk about our mornings, what is happening, what went wrong, what went right. And sometimes, we don't talk about anything. We look at each other and tell each other we miss each other. Sometimes they just need to know that from you &#8212; that you miss them and as soon as this film is over, you are taking them on vacation. Whatever the case, this special time is theirs and it is not to be missed.<br />
<br />
<b>Be present.</b> When you are with your family, whether it is at a family outing, at dinner, at your kid's soccer game, etc... BE THERE. Don't be in your studio inside your head. Don't be thinking about cues that need to be finished or sounds that need to be edited or software that needs to be upgraded. You might say to yourself, "But Deane... I am a composer. It's who I am. How do I *not* think about that stuff 24/7?" And to that I say, "You're absolutely right!" However, you are also an adult that is capable of extreme levels of organization. Just like you are complex enough to manage a library of 1,923,267 Kontakt instruments, you are capable of managing your time in such a fashion that allows you to be done with a certain volume of work in order to concentrate on the here and now of your son's little league game. End of story, so shut up.<br />
<br />
No discussion on this one, folks. Be there completely, or don't bother showing up at all. It's all the same to them, believe me. And don't think they won't notice, because they always will.<br />
<br />
<b>Take "in-betweens" and make them family exclusive.</b> An A-list film composer that I once worked for told me that he credits taking "in-betweens" as keeping his family charged up for his next film assignment. I have adopted that method and my family and I use it two or three times a year as a rest between projects. I intentionally set-aside a percentage of each job that I take on and when I am done with the gig, unless I'm headed right into another, we go away for a few days on the extra dough. Even if it is for a weekend at Catalina Island or a couple days in Santa Barbara (both very cheap and easy vacations from LA), the point is we get out of here and take a few days off. Recharge the batteries.<br />
<br />
Listen, I don't care if you are made of steel, you HAVE to rest, and so does your family. Don't forget that they go through every single gig *with* you. They are not casual spectators, they are active players in this career you have chosen. Nobody in your house rides for free &#8212; it costs each of them something to lose you to the composer's chair every day. Treat them like the priority they should be and make exclusive time away from home with them a regular activity. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ultimately, composing for film is about two things: servicing the storyline with music, and making the director/producers happy. It's really that simple. Everything else is just extra curricular stuff that does nothing but stroke your ego and make you feel like you've done your absolute best work.<br />
<br />
However, if you are also a father or a husband, a mother or a wife, you have another group of people that need pleasing, and they are even more important than the aforementioned group. Keeping your family happy and healthy is the most significant thing you can do to insure your success as a composer.<br />
<br />
I don't care how much you accomplish in your life, how many films you score, or how many awards you win &#8212; when you are on your deathbed and it's time for you to go, the LAST thing you are going to be thinking about is all the movies you worked on or the plastic statues on your mantle. In the game of life, those things are trivial. Your family &#8212; and really, your <i>legacy</i> &#8212; is what will last after you are gone. Take care of them and you will have a happy life whether you are working right now or not. You need them on your side as much as they need you on theirs. Film composing is not a solo gig... it takes the whole household being behind it to make it successful.<br />
