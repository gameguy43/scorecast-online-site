Being a geek at heart, I got into the habit of note-taking early on in my academic life and I have found that concise and easy to browse notes can save A LOT of time. If you are like me (i.e. without a 30-year experience in orchestrating), there must be times when you don\u2019t remember something and you find yourself browsing through several books or online sources to find it. That\u2019s exactly what we are looking to avoid here (as well as any bald patches from excessive head scratching)!\u00a0 So, the idea behind this series (or of any other article in the SCU channel for that matter) is to make our lives easier and help us focus our time and energy in the actual task for writing music.<\/p>\n<h2>What This Is<\/h2>\n<p>Taking Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s approach and the excellent framework\/structure of \u201cPrinciples of Orchestration Online\u201d, I will present the essence of instrumentation and orchestration in as a concise, quick and easy manner as possible, adding material from other sources and a good dose of humor where needed. Additionally, our resident musicologist Yaiza Varona will offer an extra dimension to everything; a behind-the-scenes look to help you better understand why orchestration has come to be what it is today.<\/p>\n<h2>What to Expect<\/h2>\n<p>For each orchestral section you will get two things : instrumentation notes (ranges, registers etc.) and orchestration techniques (how to use the section to play the melody and how to orchestrate the harmony within the section). After the examination of each orchestral section, we will provide you with sequencing, mixing and production techniques relevant to the instruments of that section.<\/p>\n<p>Do not expect to learn to orchestrate like a pro merely by reading these articles. It takes a lifetime of studying, researching and applying to master the art of orchestration. But, we all have to start somewhere, right? Take the notes presented here and try to apply one technique at a time.\u00a0 Study how the greats have done it and try to understand why. Unfortunately the pill for the \u2018ultimate internalization of knowledge\u2019 has not been discovered&#8230;.yet. Don\u2019t expect &#8211; like me a few years back! &#8211; to learn everything overnight. Give yourself a break and most of all, ENJOY that you can spend time doing what you love!<\/p>\n<h2>A Clarification<\/h2>\n<p>When referring to specific pitches, the \u201cRoland\u201d MIDI system is\u00a0used, where Middle C=C4.<\/p>\n<p>Also, instrument names and abbreviations come in many different shapes and colours. The ones used here are :<\/p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">Violins = VlnViolas = VlaCelli = VlcBassi = C.B<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/td>\n<td valign=\"top\">Piccolo = Picc.Flute = FlOboe = ObEnglish Horn = E.Hrn<\/p>\n<p>Clarinet = Cl<\/td>\n<td valign=\"top\">Bass Clarinet = B.ClBassoon = BsnContrabassoon = C.Bsn<\/td>\n<td valign=\"top\">French Horn : F.HTrumpet = TrpTrombone = TrbTuba = Tb<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>So, grab a cup of coffee and let\u2019s get started!<\/p>\n<h3>Instrumentation VS Orchestration VS Arrangement<\/h3>\n<p>Three different but easily confused terms. Let\u2019s get them straight :<\/p>\n<p><strong><em> <\/em><\/strong><em>The term <\/em><strong><em>Instrumentation <\/em><\/strong><em>is used to describe two things; 1) the selection of instruments used in a composition, and 2) the properties of musical instruments (construction, timbre, sound production, ranges, sound characteristics etc).<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em> <\/em><strong><em>Orchestration <\/em><\/strong><em>is the distribution of \u2018roles\u2019 to different instruments in a composition. Orchestration usually entails the writing of countermelodies and accompanying lines.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em> <\/em><strong><em>Arrangement <\/em><\/strong><em>is the process of taking a composition\/song and altering\/adapting it to another form, style or orchestration. The term \u2018arrangement\u2019 is very common in jazz music where the so-called \u2018jazz-standards\u2019 can be found in many different arrangements.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>So, what does all this have to do with us composers? Let\u2019s say you sat at your keyboard or picked up your guitar and came up with a nice melody and a chord progression. How do you turn this into a full-fledged composition? Having in mind the mood and atmosphere you want your music to exude, one of the main decisions you have to make is what instruments to use in your composition; i.e. choose your instrumentation. That requires a good knowledge of the particular characteristics and capabilities of the instruments available to you.<\/p>\n<p>Having chosen your palette and having in mind a general outline of the form of your piece, next step is to decide how to distribute your material. There are three very basic elements in each orchestration : the foreground material (i.e. your main melody), the middle-ground material (the countermelodies and certain fill-ins, runs etc) and the background material (accompanying lines, mostly the harmony and rhythm). Keep in mind that generally, the ear cannot discern more than three elements at any given time. Therefore, you must have at most 3 different \u2018roles\u2019 at the same time otherwise the listener will get lost in translation. This is where a good knowledge of orchestral devices (doublings, instrument combinations etc.) comes in very handy.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most important \u2018rules\u2019 of orchestration is variety and surprise. Keep your listeners alert by giving them little surprises every few bars. A good rule of thumb is to change the orchestration or small bits of it every few phrases or at every new section.<\/p>\n<h3>Orchestral Ensembles and Mixing Principles<\/h3>\n<p>The seating of the orchestra did not come to be what it is today for no reason. The careful placement of each instrument on stage and the size of each section has been carefully determined with mixing in mind, In the time of Beethoven and Wagner, Neve or SSL consoles were a tad expensive and hard to transport and folks preferred to do the mixing completely out of the box&#8230;without any box really!<\/p>\n<p>The main principle underlying the nature, formation and seating of the orchestra is <strong><em>balance.<\/em><\/strong> Louder and more dominant instruments are placed in the rear and come in small numbers. Instruments with less carrying power (e.g. strings) come in larger numbers and are placed at the front of the orchestra. By learning how to orchestrate you will make the mixing process much easier. Remember that a bad orchestration cannot be fixed in the mixing phase.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Stay tuned for the first installment of String writing coming shortly as well as Yaiza Varona&#8217;s Musicological look into the origins of the orchestra!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mastering the art of orchestration takes a lifetime of study, research and application.
