The availability\u00a0of large recording stages &amp; halls in tandem with world class players\u00a0have provided a wide range of options for the modern media composer.\u00a0<em>Impact Soundworks<\/em>, known for their respected line of ethnic\u00a0instruments, guitar (Shreddage 1 &amp; 2) and sound design (Juggernaut,\u00a0Celestia) libraries, have crossed into the field with <em><strong>Rhapsody: Orchestral\u00a0Percussion<\/strong><\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>A common theme amongst modern day composers is, \u201cYou\u00a0can never have too much percussion.\u201d I certainly agree with the masses\u00a0but will still ask, \u201cWhat will Rhapsody add that\u00a0I do not already have in my existing orchestral percussion libraries?\u201d\u00a0Let&#8217;s take a detailed look at the library from the ground up and see how Rhapsody responds\u00a0to that question.<\/p>\n<h2>At First Glance<\/h2>\n<p>For this review, we took a look at the full version of Rhapsody ($199 intro\u00a0and $249 regular MSRP), which\u00a0boasts an impressively large collection of drums, auxiliary percussion, hand drums and chromatic instruments with three user-controllable mic positions. The developer also offers an &#8220;essentials&#8221;\u00a0version that\u00a0contains most of the core instruments at 16-bit samples with the close\u00a0and hall mic positions. All instruments have been deeply sampled with\u00a0up to 10X round-robin and 5X velocity layers in both the full and &#8220;essentials&#8221;\u00a0versions.<\/p>\n<p>Both versions\u00a0will require the latest\u00a0retail version of Kontakt 5.3. Most of the included instruments contain\u00a0multiple articulations as well as dynamic rolls that can be controlled via the mod wheel.<\/p>\n<h2>Instruments<\/h2>\n<p>Here is a listing of all the included instruments with those\u00a0underlined as being included in the ESSENTIALS package(we will look\u00a0deeper into the organization of the instruments later in the review):<\/p>\n<h4>Drums<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Bass Drum*<\/span><br \/>\nGran Cassa*<br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Snare 1*<\/span><br \/>\nSnare 2*<br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Snare 3*<\/span><br \/>\nSnare 4*<br \/>\nSnare Ensemble*<br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Timpani*<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Tom 1<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Tom 2<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Tom 3<\/span><br \/>\nTom Ensemble*<\/p>\n<h4>Cymbals &amp; Gongs<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Cymbal Scraped<\/span><br \/>\nGong 1*<br \/>\nGong 2*<br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Piatti<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Piatti Mute<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ride Cymbal*<\/span><br \/>\nRide Cymbal Stick<br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Tam Tam*<\/span><br \/>\nViennese Cymbal*<\/p>\n<h4>Chromatic Percussion<\/h4>\n<p>Crotales<br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Glockenspiel<\/span><br \/>\nMarimba<br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Tubular Bells<\/span><br \/>\nXylophone<\/p>\n<h4>Aux Percussion<\/h4>\n<p>Castanets*<br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Claves<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Chimes<\/span><br \/>\nCowbell<br \/>\nFinger Cymbals<br \/>\nGuiro<br \/>\nMetals<br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Shaker*<\/span><br \/>\nSleigh Bells*<br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Tambourine*<\/span><br \/>\nTemple Blocks<br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Triangle*<\/span><br \/>\nVibraslap<br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Woodblocks<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Hand Drums<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Bongo High*<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Bongo Low*<\/span><br \/>\nCajon 1*<br \/>\nCajon 2*<br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Conga High*<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Conga Low*<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Conga Muted<\/span><br \/>\nDarbuka 1*<br \/>\nDarbuka 2*<br \/>\nDjembe 1*<br \/>\nDjembe 2*<\/p>\n<p>(Those listed with an * have mod wheel controlled dynamics)<\/p>\n<p>The full version comes with a choice to receive the library as\u00a0a 16-Bit(4 GB) or 24-Bit(9 GB) package. Both versions are available\u00a0via download delivery at <a href=\"http:\/\/impactsoundworks.com\/rhapsody-orchestral-percussion\/\" target=\"_blank\">www.impactsoundworks.com<\/a>. The library\u00a0comes with a well-documented and comprehensive users guide that\u00a0can also be downloaded via the product page on their website. I highly\u00a0recommend reviewing the manual as it has a nice breakdown of all the\u00a0included instruments and articulations as well as tips on how to use\/mix library and conserve system resources.<\/p>\n<h2>Interface<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2180\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Rhapsody_UI_1-389x165.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"389\" height=\"165\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Rhapsody_UI_1-389x165.jpg 389w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Rhapsody_UI_1-300x127.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Rhapsody_UI_1.jpg 631w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The GUI for Rhapsody certainly gets right to the point and\u00a0provides the user with an efficient means for editing and sound\u00a0sculpting the instruments from the ground level. All of the options you\u00a0need for editing are provided right from the main page with no multiple\u00a0menus, macros, etc. The GUI supports the following features:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access to all 3 microphone positions \u2014 Close, Stage &amp; Far \u2014\u00a0with control over Mix, Panning and Width. Mics can also be\u00a0purged from memory to save on CPU.<\/li>\n<li>A menu to pull up a specific instrument (see All in 1\u00a0Patches) with individual volume and tuning settings.<\/li>\n<li>Standard ADSR Envelope<\/li>\n<li>3 Band \u201cG\u201d EQ<\/li>\n<li>Access to an internal reverb with settings for wetness and\u00a0size.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Patches<\/h2>\n<p>The library organizes the patches into 2 distinct options:<\/p>\n<h4>All-in-1 Patches<\/h4>\n<p>Groups of instruments are all included into their respective\u00a0percussion family and stretched over the range of the keyboard.\u00a0For instance, ROP Aux Percussion will contain all of the auxiliary\u00a0instruments into one patch. The instrument selector allows the user to\u00a0make individual adjustments to all editable features for that specific\u00a0instrument or articulation(the articulation is also displayed in a box\u00a0each time the respective key is triggered on the keyboard). There is also\u00a0an option to have any changes applied globally to all the included\u00a0instruments. These patches also allow the user to split the instruments\u00a0out along multiple outputs through Kontakt.<\/p>\n<h4>Single Instruments<\/h4>\n<p>We also have the choice of splitting each instrument into its own\u00a0patch versus globally with the other instruments. This has become a\u00a0common practice with many developers but completely is up to the\u00a0user\u2019s preference. I personally prefer the single instrument approach\u00a0but many of my colleagues do prefer the latter. It is worth noting that\u00a0all the patches in Rhapsody provide an option to save any preferred\u00a0settings that can be recalled for later use.<\/p>\n<h2>Overall Sound and Playability<\/h2>\n<p>So lets get back to the original question and see if we can\u00a0provide some insight into what may or may not set Rhapsody apart\u00a0from our existing crop of Orchestral Percussion libraries. Impact\u00a0Soundworks\u2019 noted intention with the library was to provide a flexible\u00a0and efficient route to Orchestral Percussion that can easily fit into\u00a0whatever orchestral palette you frequent.<\/p>\n<p>Loading up the ROP Drums\u00a0and Ensembles Patch at the initialization stage has the Close Mic\u2019s gain\u00a0at the mid-point of the mix knob while the Stage Mic is gradually less\u00a0and the Hall Mic ever more so. This is a recommended starting point\u00a0from the developer to achieve a nice orchestral balance. The setting\u00a0noted here has a more dry but no less detailed timbre than what we are\u00a0used to from recent percussion libraries. Once I increased the gain on\u00a0the overall patch (-6db to unity gain) as well as the gain on the Close\u00a0Mic, the level of detail and body on the Bass Drum was easily more\u00a0apparent.<\/p>\n<p>The inclusion of a heavy mix on both the Stage and Hall Mics\u00a0can easily push the library towards \u201cEpic\u201d territory (along with a\u00a0boatload of processing) if that\u2019s what the user desires. I found the core\u00a0orchestral elements could suit my needs quite well. The only instrument\u00a0that left me wanting a bit \u201cmore\u201d out of this group was the Timpani. The\u00a0timbre and playability responds nicely but the overall dynamic range\u00a0had me wanting a bit more on the upper velocity layers. This is also a\u00a0completely subjective opinion and the inclusion of an instrument of this\u00a0scope in an already extensive package is a great bonus.<\/p>\n<p>The Auxiliary Instruments along with the Cymbals, Gongs Tubular\u00a0Bells and Crotales all play and sound fantastic. Lets face it, with a\u00a0percussion library\u00a0we want to \u201cplay\u201d the instrument. Pounding away\u00a0through the round robins at each dynamic level show a very strong\u00a0attention to detail in the editing of the samples, making a realistic and fun result to playing these patches. The Hand Drums lend themselves\u00a0to this extremely well and are a pleasure to play. The Marimba,\u00a0Xylophone and Glockenspiel have all been captured very well and the\u00a0tonality and playability is certainly on par with the rest of the library.\u00a0The flexibility of the Mic Positions allow you to place these instruments\u00a0in as intimate or as large a setting as needed.<\/p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts and Impressions<\/h2>\n<p>My final thoughts on Rhapsody can be\u00a0summed up into these 3 points:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Impact Soundworks set out to develop an Orchestral\u00a0Percussion Library that was of high quality and content but\u00a0was ultimately more focused on malleability and workflow.\u00a0Did they succeed? Yes.<\/li>\n<li>The sheer amount of instruments included is impressive\u00a0and with no corners cut.<\/li>\n<li>The price point for the full library is an absolute steal and\u00a0makes this an attractive option for both newcomers and\u00a0more tenured users that may have already invested in\u00a0another option(s). This library can no doubt add to what\u00a0you may already have in your arsenal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Particulars<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Rhapsody Orchestral Percussion<\/strong>\u00a0by\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/impactsoundworks.com\/rhapsody-orchestral-percussion\/\" target=\"_blank\">Impact Soundworks<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>$199<\/strong>\u00a0(launch price); <strong>$249<\/strong> (MSRP)<br \/>\nPowered by full retail\u00a0<strong><strong>Native Instruments Kontakt<\/strong><br \/>\n<\/strong>Purchase\u00a0Rhapsody\u00a0or listen to demos at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/impactsoundworks.com\/rhapsody-orchestral-percussion\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>impactsoundworks.com<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Orchestral percussion is a venture that many sample library developers have challenged.
