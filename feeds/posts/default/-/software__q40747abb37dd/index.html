Inside, you’re instantly presented with the sheets to which you have access rights, and you start working.  It’s pretty intuitive.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLet’s think about the implications of being “in the cloud”.  In the past, if you wanted to use personal computers to construct a distributed collaboratorium involving several individuals, you had to make sure they all had the same software on their computers.  If the collaborators were independent contractors, each would have had to purchase and install his or her own copy of any software needed.  You would have had to ensure that each collaborator owned a sufficiently compatible computer with adequate horsepower.  And then there could be a steep learning curve.  All of these factors would have been expense issues and coordination nightmares – which would have served as a barriers to ever getting the team together and off the ground.  The idea of instant, effortless, low-cost, Internet-enabled collaboration would have been little more than a wistful dream.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut with cloud-based collaboration using \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSmartSheet\u003c/span\u003e, most of these barriers evaporate.  All each collaborator needs is a low-cost laptop or netbook computer capable of running a modern web browser (and it doesn’t have to be the same browser on each individual’s computer).  Mobile device fans can even connect via their smartphones when on the move.  It’s literally true that if you’ve thought through your collaboration and project tracking methodology and have instrumented it in terms of a set of \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esmart sheet\u003c/span\u003e templates, you can choose team members, invite them into your collaboratorium (by means I’ll explain below), and tie them together within a matter of hours or maybe even minutes, with very little learning curve and \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ezero \u003c/span\u003eincremental buy-in cost on the part of invitees.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNotice that these benefits are \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ein addition to\u003c/span\u003e the most basic advantage of \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eany \u003c/span\u003escheme for collaborating over the web:  namely, that the members of your team can be distributed geographically – even across the globe – or, can be in the same room.  This means new flexibility in how you think about team formation and professional relationships.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eThe Benefit Of Sourcing Documents From The Cloud\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLet’s return for a moment to the fact that sharing project documents over the web is central to the way collaboration and project tracking are instrumented when using \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSmartSheet\u003c/span\u003e.  But how does storing these documents in the cloud and sourcing them to team members from the cloud improve sharing?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSharing documents might not seem like such a big deal at first, especially for computer-based documents.  You think,\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003e of course I’m going to share my documents with my team members, just like I always have\u003c/span\u003e.  And then you think:  \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eany time I revise a document, I’ll just send a copy of the updated document file to each team member, right?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere’s a potential problem with this thinking.  If a separate copy of a document resides on each team member’s computer, and the document is subject to change (especially if it can be changed frequently or by more than one person), the possibility arises that different team members can find themselves inadvertently working with \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003edifferent versions\u003c/span\u003e of the document.  In other words, team members can get out of sync with one another.  What could make this happen?  \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eScore changes, \u003c/span\u003eof course!  In today’s film music world, late changes – even up to the last minute – are an increasing risk.  Why?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWell, in the pre-digital age, a much less automated post-production technology meant that late-stage changes to picture or dialog caused unacceptable disruption that could delay final release, with adverse financial impact.  To avoid such disruptions, it used to be that \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003epicture lock\u003c/span\u003e was put into effect far earlier than it is now, relative to the targeted release date.  The lengthy time allowed for post-production let the start of film music work be postponed until picture lock, and thus composers could usually rely on working against stable picture.  But today, computers and digital technologies have drastically accelerated post-production, such that directors can (and often do) keep tweaking their films until much closer to the scheduled release date than before.  In contrast, the process of composing and producing film music \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ehasn’t \u003c/span\u003eaccelerated to the same degree.  The result is that music development is increasingly exposed to late dramatic and timing changes that require cues to be re-worked.  Cue revisions mean that documents supporting the music development process are being changed.  And, as I’ve pointed out, one of the ways a rush of changes can lead to chaos sand lost time is by causing inconsistencies to emerge between the versions of documents that different team members have.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut with \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSmartSheet \u003c/span\u003eand similar cloud-based document-sharing technologies, the idea is that team members \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003edon’t\u003c/span\u003e send copies of documents, revised or otherwise, to one another.  Instead, a \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esingle copy\u003c/span\u003e of each document (a \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esmart sheet\u003c/span\u003e) is stored in the cloud.  All team members work with that single copy – which reflects the latest revision status – within the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSmartSheet \u003c/span\u003eon-line environment.  In this way, the emergence of conflicting document versions is avoided – and with it, the associated chaos.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eEven better – although \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSmartSheet \u003c/span\u003ealways shows you (or any team member) the latest version of a document, it also shows you at a glance \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ewhat’s recently changed\u003c/span\u003e – information that could easily be overlooked with conventional documents.

However, many or most film music enterprises are probably small enough that there need be only one sheet creator.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo, it all starts with an entrepreneurially-motivated individual – most likely the composer, who is typically at the head of his or her film music enterprise.  That person opens one of several types of paid accounts with \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esmartsheet.com\u003c/span\u003e.  There is a monthly (or annual) fee (as little as $8.50 a month for the most basic account), which entitles the payer to be a sheet creator and provides an \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eallotment of sheets\u003c/span\u003e.

I just don't have a stock answer for what I use that truly excites me and would be of benefit to those reading this.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca name\u003d'more'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eI could list some of my favorite pieces of essential hardware like my BLUE Kickball mic or Apple computer, or some of my favorite software titles like Logic Pro, MachFive 2, or Finale, which I use daily, but I figure the majority of composers out there are already aware of these popular tools. In a profession dominated by technical gadgetry, I want to go old school and talk about three pieces of gear that are indispensable in helping me become the composer I'm striving to be while adding a bit of insight for those composers receptive to it. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003ePiano\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eA gorgeous, well-tuned piano, is one of the most expressive, acrobatic, and versatile instruments ever invented. It translates to nearly every style of music imaginable and can fill the sonic spectrum with almost as much color as a symphonic orchestra. While the piano is certainly not new to film music, I feel its use has grown somewhat trite even though there is nothing inherent about this instrument that requires it to be so. Just ask yourself, has the piano been fully explored in film music (or any music for that matter). Are there roads left to travel which could reveal new perspectives of this magnificent instrument? \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI scored a film earlier this year where I wrote a traditional piece of music in strict sonata form for piano and cello during several key developments in the narrative. I wrote these early in the scoring process and recorded them before finishing the entire score. The studio I used had a gorgeous Steinway piano that sung like a choir of angels each time my finger touched a key. After the cues were in the can, I fell so in love with this instrument that I wrote the entire finale of the film for three solo pianos! I returned to the studio a couple of weeks later and performed the primary part while overdubbing the second and third parts. The low costs involved in utilizing a world-class instrument in a creative way made this a very feasible approach which I aim to employ again in the future. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eViolin/Cello\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMost composers (including me) strive to record their music with a symphony orchestra. Who can blame us? The orchestra is our \"biggest box of crayons\" and produces such a wonderfully vivid and magical array of sonic imagery. However it's grotesquely expensive and not a realistic option for the majority of films I work on. This is true for many composers out there making a living off their music. A popular option for harnessing the power of a symphonic orchestra while simultaneously keeping within the limits of low-budget independent film production is to utilize powerful computer processing and samples to replicate a live orchestra. This is a fine approach, but for me when my budgets get low, I'd rather hire as many live players as I can afford rather than substitute them for sampled instruments from my computer. Even with a library of thousands upon thousands of sounds, I feel shackled creatively when compared to the immense freedom I enjoy composing for a live solo instrument. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe solo violin or solo cello is one such instrument I try to utilize at every appropriate opportunity. I'll substitute for sampled instruments where I can but I'll let the focus of the music rest on whatever live instrument I've employed. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhile so many are aware of the advantages and prestige an orchestra brings to a score, it seems to me that an almost equal number has seemingly forgot that one solo instrument, composed with skill and an understanding of that instrument, can bring almost as much strength, emotion, imagery, and dignity to a score as a seventy-five piece ensemble. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eHarp (MachFive 2)\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAh-ha! Finally, some technology! If you listen to the film music I've composed over the last couple years of my career you'll notice the harp dominates the majority of it. I love the harp! It's a wonderful companion to the piano. Almost as versatile, almost as acrobatic, and every bit as beautiful as the piano, the harp creates colors not explored as often thus keeping it relatively fresh in the ears of the listener.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe one hitch is most of my harp usage is generated from a really fantastic sample library. Surprisingly enough, it's the harp library that is included in MOTU's universal sampler, MachFive 2. Now, don't get me wrong, I would still rather hire a live harpist and will do so if I have the budget for it, but harp is one of those instruments with a harsh reality attached: a) harp players are relatively rare, and b) they're expensive to hire both for their skills and for their excessive instrument cartage fees. This makes it a prime candidate for utilizing a library rather than a live musician.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMy mixing engineer even developed a radical EQ setting for my harp library so whenever he gets tracks from me utilizing it, he knows to just lay in that EQ setting and start from there. It's absolutely uncanny how realistic it sounds. A friend of mine, who is a Pulitzer Prize nominated composer, attended a film I scored last year. I utilized a mix of live players and sampled instruments and after learning the names of all my live musicians, my friend asked me who my harpist was. I told him, that was a sampled instrument. He was shocked! \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eYa, it's that good. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e--\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere you have it! My overall message with this article is to keep in mind the power of the live musician even if it's just a solo instrument. It's very inexpensive and yet produces so much more compositional and creative freedom than even the largest sample libraries can't provide. Thanks for reading and happy composing and listening to you all!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e_____________\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-size: x-small;\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eBRIAN SATTERWHITE\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/span\u003eis an award-winning film composer and conductor based in Austin, Texas.

The majority of competing orchestral virtual instrument products are based on direct instrument waveform sampling technology and often involve huge and relatively inflexible sample libraries.\u0026nbsp; In place of fixed samples, WIVIs utilize a highly-parameterized instrument waveform model based on a technique similar to additive synthesis.\u0026nbsp; Most of these parameters can be varied continuously via MIDI, allowing nuances of playing technique far beyond what is typically possible with samples.\u0026nbsp; In addition, WIVIs utilize various types of randomization that not only can mimic variations characteristic of real playing but also counteract \"phasing\" effects that otherwise occur when virtual instruments are combined into ensembles.\u0026nbsp; WIVI plugins (VST, RTAS, and AU) take very little RAM or disk space and, for this reason, help complex projects to load extremely quickly in a DAW.\u0026nbsp; They run happily in either 32- or 64-bit environments under either Windows or Mac operating systems.\u0026nbsp; WIVIs are set up using a unique and powerful visual user interface that excels in both parametric flexibility and the ability to configure ensembles.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCurrent WIVIs include many types of flutes, oboes, bassoons, clarinets, saxophones, and brass instruments (muted as well as unmuted) and are sold in bundles, working out to an average cost of about $25 per instrument.\u0026nbsp; A comprehensive set of WIVIs costs about $1500-$1600, street price.\u0026nbsp; Additional WIVIs are believed to be in development.\u0026nbsp; Strings, however, are notably missing from Wallander's offering and may or may not appear in the future.\u0026nbsp; Since I wrote about WIVIs in my July 15, 2009 SCOREcast column article, Wallander Instruments has released version 2.30, which makes many improvements to not only the WIVI interactive player but also to the sound and playability of all of the WIVI instruments.\u0026nbsp; Overall, I'm very enthusiastic about the expressiveness, creative possibilities, and sound quality WIVIs deliver and the degree to which they free me from many of the serious limitations of sample-based technology.\u0026nbsp; I just can't say enough about them.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eLA Scoring Strings\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIntroduced in July, 2009, \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.audiobro.com/\"\u003eLA Scoring Strings\u003c/a\u003e (LASS) is a sample-based string virtual instrument product that I think is representative of a trend toward increasing realism and playability in this sector of the composer's arsenal.\u0026nbsp; An intense battle among several competitors in this product area is easy to understand given the central importance of strings in traditional orchestra.\u0026nbsp; For what it delivers, LASS is well worth the $1200 cost.\u0026nbsp; LASS is at once notable for its beautiful, expressive sound and for what it does to simplify creation of convincing MIDI mockups of divisi string passages.\u0026nbsp; LASS approaches divisi by offering, in effect, 5 separately-recorded sample libraries rolled into one:\u0026nbsp; first chair (solo), two different 1/4 divisi sections, a 1/2 divisi section, and a full section -- for each of Violin 1, Violin 2, Viola, Cello, and Bass.\u0026nbsp; Samples from the different section types can be combined in any way desired, either to implement divisi or to create a full orchestra with maximum sonic diversity that maximizes the impression of realism.\u0026nbsp; LASS is also equipped with scripts (which run in the included Kontakt 3.5 playback engine environment) that make it relatively easy to orchestrate with samples of real legato, portamento, and glissando playing under MIDI control.\u0026nbsp; Additional scripts support trills, patterns of short articulations, tuning, and other features.\u0026nbsp; However, while LASS supports the string articulations one is most likely to need, some articulations, such as col legno, are not provided and may require you to combine LASS with another string library.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNot surprisingly, considering it is a sample library, LASS uses a lot of RAM.\u0026nbsp; To take full advantage of its features, one is likely to need a 64-bit computer with the ability to address between 8 and 16 Gbytes of RAM, and even then you have to put up with long project load times.\u0026nbsp; Audiobro advises that you may also need to utilize two multi-core computers if handling complex orchestrations, though I been successful running LASS on a single 8-core Windows PC.\u0026nbsp; If you have this level of compute power, you'll be amazed at what you can do.\u0026nbsp; If you don't, there are various ways of working with lesser resources, but with increasing degrees of compromise and/or inconvenience.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e_____________\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-size: x-small;\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eJIM WELL\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/span\u003eis the author of SCOREcast's \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eInside the Outside\u003c/span\u003e column.

If you write music at the computer, your sequencing platform informs everything else you do. Its importance is paramount. It has to be solid, flexible, and powerful… and above all, it has to serve any need you might conceivably have in your composing life. Digital Performer delivers for me on all counts.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFor me this application has, over the years, become a transparent filter. I've worked with it for thousands—tens of thousands—of hours, and my fingers just know where to go. If you're a user of Logic, Cubase or any of the other major platforms out there, you may have the same feeling about your work canvas… at some point it's just a matter of what you \"grew up\" using. For me, it's Digital Performer—since 1989, when it was plain old Performer. For twenty years and counting, and I don't see myself switching anytime soon.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eOmnisphere\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOn the other hand, Omnisphere is one of the newest additions to my arsenal, and it's just a sick powerhouse of a sound module. The variety and sound quality of what you'll find here is unparalleled, in my experience… and the playability and \"inspiration\" factor are downright dangerous. I've caught myself spending hours on end in enjoyable tone patrol, just seeing what this monster can do. And when you add the processing capabilities they've added onto this beast, the entire thing steps up yet another level. Seriously… it's unbelievable.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI'm not nearly done scratching the surface of what Omnisphere will bring to my writing. I'd sum it up this way: sometimes you buy a new piece of gear because of its range: it does many things you need (or that you discover you need once you've made the purchase). Other gear you buy because it does one thing incredibly well. Omnisphere gives you both these functions… and that's just plain wrong. Spectrasonics is a company of absolute lunatics for letting this thing go at the current price point. There. I said it.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eM-Audio keyboards\u003c/b\u003e (Keystation Pro 88 et al.)\u003cbr /\u003eFor me there are two camps of controllers: the Really Expensive, Really Nice Controller, and the Really Cheap, Readily Replaceable Controller. If you have true keyboard chops, you probably want to purchase the former and keep it around for a long, long time. The exquisite action of the hammers… the glorious reproduction of an actual piano \"feel\"… all these things make a difference to you.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMe, I'm a hack. I can play just well enough to enter the information in when I'm sequencing… and that's it. It's simply not a skill I've developed. Fully-weighted keyboards actually make my hands ache after a few hours of hard sequencing. So I buy a new, cheap, semi-weighted keyboard controller every year or two, and I just abuse that sucker. Inevitably it bites the dust, and I buy a new one. But that's a strategy that works for me. And M-Audio offers lots of bells and whistles on their 88-key range (and I'd recommend 88 keys for you—if you haven't worked with the full 88, you honestly don't know what you're missing!), at a price that makes it possible for me to get by with my (lack of) performance technique.
