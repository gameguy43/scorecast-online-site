The library was so forward thinking with such an unorthodox concept that many have wondered how they could possibly follow up that release.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The answer comes in the form of their brand new pulse-driven sample library: <b>SIGNAL<\/b>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">SIGNAL<b>\u00a0<\/b>combines the warmth of analog and aggressive synthesis with an immense collection of organic, sampled instruments, but the true lure of the library rests with the inclusion of its \u201cPulse Engine\u201d, which allows for up to four independent, tempo-locking rhythms across two separate sound source layers to create that \u201cheartbeat\u201d at the center of your track.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We will take a detailed look at the library from the ground up to see what\u2019s included, how it operates and ultimately what it will\u00a0add to your existing sample library arsenal.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>General Overview<\/h2>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">SIGNAL<b>\u00a0<\/b>requires Kontakt 5.3.1 or higher and is compatible with the Kontakt Free Player.

The developer recommends (and I agree) that you access the \u201cpreset\u201d browser page first when initially diving into the library. This can be accessed by simply clicking on any\u00a0preset name (e.g. &#8220;Dark Clacks&#8221;, pictured above) from the main page. The browser is laid out in a familiar, yet very welcomed format; simply click on one (or many) of the \u201csmart tags\u201d in the left-side palette and the right window pane will provide a listing of compatible instruments, based on your choices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are five hundred \u2014 That&#8217;s right\u2026 500! \u2014\u00a0different instruments in SIGNAL<b>\u00a0<\/b>and<b> <\/b>I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better way to audition\u00a0them than the way this browser is constructed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So how does it sound on a first play through?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0\u00a0<\/span>I clicked on \u201cEpic\u201d and \u201cOrganic\u201d and chose the patch \u201cSun King\u201d from the browser \u2013 I played a three-note D minor triad and heard a deep, gritty, pulsating arpeggiated figure with two intersecting polyrhythms. Awesome. I proceeded to get lost over the next hour sampling various different instruments from the browser and the immediate attention to the production value and execution of the patches were very impressive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/_Htvz6KwHjQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Let\u2019s move over to the \u201cPulse Engines\u201d page to get under the hood and see what SIGNAL\u00a0reveals\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2>The Pulse Engines<\/h2>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 2\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div id=\"attachment_2233\" style=\"width: 399px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http:\/\/outputsounds.com\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2233\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2233 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.12.10-389x374.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"389\" height=\"374\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.12.10-389x374.png 389w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.12.10-640x615.png 640w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.12.10-300x288.png 300w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.12.10.png 649w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2233\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pulse Engines<\/p><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The true heart of SIGNAL\u00a0rests within its \u201cPulse Engines\u201d page. At first glance the layout may seem daunting and complex, but Output has made the source audio flow so intuitively that you\u2019ll want to dig deeper and deeper at the sounds and the engine\u2019s capability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">SIGNAL<b>\u00a0<\/b>gives you two separate sound sources that can be loaded and played in unison. Simply clicking on the \u201cSignal Pulse Engines\u201d window in the middle of the page will disable the pulse engine, leaving just the sound sources by themselves. Each sound source has it\u2019s own channel strip \u00a0and when you click on the instrument picture\/name it will open the sound source browser. There is an immense collection of synths and organic instruments in the browser that can be quickly loaded into the existing patch. This is a fantastic addition as you can quickly tryout new sounds in your loaded instrument that may mesh even better to your ears than before. Don\u2019t want the \u201cSub Sine\u201d? Why not load up a deep sampled \u201cMuted Guitar\u201d and see how that sounds? The possibilities are endless. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Let\u2019s focus on <em>Pulse Engine A<\/em> for now (<em>Pulse Engine B<\/em> has all the functionality identical to Pulse Engine A). You will see a tab of \u201cMain Rhythm\u201d and \u201c2<\/span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>nd<\/sup><\/span><span class=\"s1\"> Rhythm\u201d, each able to be activated or deactivated by clicking the corresponding power switch. The \u201cMain Rhythm\u201d is the first engine your source audio will pass through and you have multiple options to create that \u201cpulse\u201d from the audio. SIGNAL<b>\u00a0<\/b>gives you access to a Wave Form (LFO), Step Sequencer, Arpeggiator or a Loop mechanism (see picture above under Engine B) to modulate the audio signal. Regardless of which option you choose, you can manipulate the time format via bars, standard signatures (1\/2, 1\/4, 1\/16, etc.), and dotted or triplet subdivisions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The \u201c2<\/span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>nd<\/sup><\/span><span class=\"s1\"> Rhythm\u201d will take the carrier signal through an additional rhythmic manipulation, available to you via LFO or Step Sequencer. The level of control and audio quality of all these parameters is stunning, making it simple to create highly useable and complex rhythmic figures on the fly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As mentioned, all this can be done with\u00a0Pulse Engine B as well, but with a completely separate (or same) audio source.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0SIGNAL<\/span>\u00a0also makes it very easy for you to copy\/paste one rhythm in Pulse Engine A to Pulse Engine B through an elegant transfer window. <\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2232\" style=\"width: 399px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http:\/\/outputsounds.com\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2232\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-2232\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.03.11-389x374.png\" alt=\"Macro Sliders\" width=\"389\" height=\"374\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.03.11-389x374.png 389w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.03.11-640x615.png 640w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.03.11-300x288.png 300w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.03.11.png 649w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2232\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Macro Sliders<\/p><\/div>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The four available macro sliders are perhaps the most flexible and intuitive feature in SIGNAL. Output meticulously crafted these macros so they are completely unique to each of the 500 instruments found in the library. I immediately assigned each macro slider to an available slider on my MIDI controller. The macros can make the sound modulate from subtle to drastic just from the flick of the slider. For instance, you can distort, widen, open\/close filters, blend layers or completely change one of the four available rhythms on the fly. Moving around all four macros at the same time pull out instant inspiration and promote these patches for live performance.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>There is a Macro Page from the instrument menu that will allow you too see which particular instrument parameters are being controlled by the sliders and these can be further adjusted as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Want to go even deeper with the sounds? You can quickly access the \u201cAdvanced Tab\u201d from the Pulse Engines page or the the \u201cEffects\u201d page for even further tweaking. All effects can be applied globally or individually between Pulse Engine A or Pulse Engine B.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2234\" style=\"width: 630px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/outputsounds.com\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2234\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2234\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.17.44-640x616.png\" alt=\"Effects page\" width=\"620\" height=\"597\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.17.44-640x616.png 640w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.17.44-389x375.png 389w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.17.44-300x289.png 300w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-04-01-12.17.44.png 649w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2234\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Effects page<\/p><\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 4\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>Final Observations<\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 5\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I am just gonna come right out and say it: <b>SIGNAL\u00a0<\/b>is flat out brilliant! <a title=\"Output\" href=\"http:\/\/outputsounds.com\/products\/signal\/\" target=\"_blank\">Output<\/a> has once again created an intuitive and inspirational composing tool of the highest production standard.
