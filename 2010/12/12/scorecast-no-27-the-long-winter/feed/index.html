					<description><![CDATA[Oh I like this podcast! ^^

FYI, that &quot;whistling&quot; instrument is the excellent free VSTi &quot;The Shepherd&quot; (http://www.simple-media.co.uk/music/vsti/vsti.htm#theshepherd). Really fun to play with and the results can be amazing for such a simple synth!

As for the Zimmerman story: In the THR interview (http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/heat-vision/hans-zimmer-scoring-superman-fast-56714), it definitely sounds like Zimmer hasn&#039;t been asked at all... But it&#039;s well possible that the reboot might take the franchise in a totally new direction, and much like Elfman&#039;s theme wouldn&#039;t have worked very well with Nolan&#039;s Batman, I don&#039;t think &quot;rewriting&quot; Williams, or Beethoven, is much of a revelant issue... I can still see it happening...

What I find strange though, is that since this rumor got out, every discussion&#039;s about Williams and how ANYBODY would be crazy to try to follow in his footsteps... But everybody seems to ignore that that task was already given to Ottman a few years ago with Superman Returns (which I only caught on tv a few years back, and frankly I&#039;m not very familiar with the soundtrack). Really, what&#039;s up with that?]]></description>
