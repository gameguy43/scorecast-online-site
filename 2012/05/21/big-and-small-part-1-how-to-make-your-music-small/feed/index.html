		<description><![CDATA[Great stuff, Jeff! I love the thoughts on &quot;ambience&quot;. As a percussionist, I listen to drums in recordings, both in radio and records and in film music. The tendency for most people is to go for big sounds and huge reverbs to help &quot;push&quot; the false size of whatever kit/set up they had to work with, whether virtual or live. When toning down, however, people still tend to use large rooms and big bouncy &#039;verbs. It&#039;s a huge oversight and one that makes no sense when recording in a real-world situation. Therefore it doesn&#039;t translate to a virtual one.


Great points all around. Looking forward to the next!]]></description>
