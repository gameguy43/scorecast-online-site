		<description><![CDATA[But all important questions, Michael.

There are some things that can be tried.  I think sometimes we want to please so much that we don’t even venture a question which might be interpreted as argumentative.  On the other hand, if the phraseology is wrong, such an attempt could actually be argumentative.  Here’s an example of what might be tried:

			      COMPOSER (to Director)

 “You know, your film doesn’t look like anyone else’s film.  There is significant originality here!  What if we could capture all the dramatic elements in the temp with a score as original as your film?”

				(con’t)

“Can we just take a moment to talk about the temp score and what it is that’s working for you?  Is it tempo; grit; heavy; dark; light, etc?”

The idea, unless you ARE John Williams or Hans Zimmer, is not to have the score sound like you but, rather, sound original.  Even when you ARE Hans Zimmer, the likelihood is that the film maker will not want it to sound like Hans Zimmer but rather like “that film you scored........what was it?”]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great article and great comments everyone.

I work hard to nurture and market my own musical voice, but to play devil&#039;s advocate, how does one cross the line from being paid to sound like someone else, to being hired for your own sound.

Consider a director who wants a score similar to the temp, but can&#039;t afford the composer who originally wrote most of the temp music.  Of course, the answer is &quot;add your own flavor to the project&quot;, but I would argue that it often ends up as a collaboration of sorts between the two composers (though one without knowing it!).  A &#039;mashup of sounds&#039;, if you will.

It&#039;s been my experience, the average working composer is not hired for their sound (like 30 years ago) but because of a relationship and the ability to produce whatever is asked of them.  It seems to me that we are required to be everything-to-everyone. But in doing so, aren&#039;t losing our individuality?

Food for thought.
Is our own voice now relegated to only be heard through personal projects?
Should we wait patiently for directors/producers that take our musical opinions seriously?
By simply producing the music, even if it&#039;s al-la something else, does it already inherently have a stamp of &#039;me&#039; on it?
Is a good portion of what we do gently coaxing the director/producer toward what the score *should* be; because aren&#039;t we supposed to be the expert?
Should we simply be thankful to be earning a living doing what we love?

Again, &quot;to play devil&#039;s advocate, how does one cross the line from being paid to sound like someone else, to being hired for your own sound?&quot;

(wow, there are a lot questions in there..)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yea, great point - mix it up.  

We have a scourge of Gothic choir overload in every single film and game trailer from the indies to the majors ... it`s like one composer was aware of Orff, but then each one that followed was a copy of a copy of a copy, so we end up with a sea of really crappy, melodramatic, volume advantaged Carmina Burana rips.  

Sorry, was I yelling?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And yet when you record your own Taikos on some mediocre pre amps with your friend engineering, and layer them OVER your Stormdrums, it still sounds BETTER, partly because suddenly I have some ownership of that sound, but also partly because, frankly, music is completely subjective, and my tastes vary incredibly from Nick Phoenix&#039;s.

Can you imagine if every film had a Nick Phoenix score? We&#039;d be hearing full Gothic choir for every scene in &quot;Good Will Hunting.&quot;  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great point.  The barrier to entry is extremely low = the market is saturated.  We have a tonne of people out there who can sound &#039;great&#039;.  So, in a way, the answer is better looked at from a business perspective - how do you differentiate in a saturated market, ie: all things being the same, why pick composer a. over composer b.?  Two possible answers are, use the same tool as everyone else but use it *differently*, or use something else entirely (or in combination).  So, while you may not be able to force your &#039;voice&#039;, there is probably a lot of merit in considering what you might try to get there and experimenting.

I think it takes some courage too, though - because there is a line of thinking that states that &quot;good = sounds like what came before&quot;.  Doing things differently means taking a chance, knowing that you are actively cutting yourself out of a certain sector of the market.  However, if you can find that tiny niche where you fit, and suddenly your competition for that kind of work is 1/100000 of what it was, that&#039;s not a bad place to be.

As an aside, it&#039;s amazing to consider every once in while what those libraries actually are.  Imagine you actually hired Eric Persing to record some taikos for you, with the best players, in that gorgeous hall, with the best mics and the hottest engineer on a million dollar board with Neve pres and and and.  Now everyone just loads up Stormdrum ... and there it is - it really sounds like a million bucks.  When you really think about that one note when you play it... it&#039;s kind of a WTF moment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dr. Seuss was once famously asked, &quot;Why do you draw so strangely?&quot;  He replied, &quot;It&#039;s the only way I know how.&quot;  Or words to that effect.  He&#039;d clearly found his voice and run with it.  

One thing I&#039;d like to add to everyone still up-and-coming is that one&#039;s voice is not found by just accepting one&#039;s limitations.  I&#039;ve met people who just wouldn&#039;t try conducting because that wasn&#039;t in their initial skill set (e.g. coming from a rock or jazz background) or others who really wanted to be a classical composer and not deal with software and samplers.  While it is true that many a composer I like works within a defined range that plays to their strengths and avoids their weaknesses (Glass, Danna, Nyman), I&#039;d like to think that they, and we, come to that place of artistic sweet spot(s) by trying out new areas and pushing ourselves.  When I didn&#039;t have the studio firepower to write huge realistic studio scores (or actually, was in between a so-so initial orchestral library and a truly good one), I wrote smaller scores and got great feedback from people about it...and started to think that maybe I shouldn&#039;t bother with big symphonic music.  That wasn&#039;t me finding my voice, but rather starting to let an avenue of expression slip away by accepting temporary circumstances as permanent.  A few big purchases and some labors later, and I&#039;m up and running with big scores again.  The same could go with other areas.  Just because you&#039;ve never had to write hip hop or hardstyle trance doesn&#039;t mean you could try.  It might not become your signature sound, but those kinds of range-stretching exercises often add interesting color to your own unique voice.  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another thought provoking topic Deane.  Thanks.
I’ve always thought that “finding” your voice was a misnomer.  Rather, I believe it is “discovering” the voice within you when it finally matures and is ready to come out.
Your voice is merely a stew of all the various musical influences, some almost subconscious, which have been a part of your life.  That’s what makes it so individualistic as Deane demonstrates so beautifully.
It is also why I have always encouraged my students to experience all kinds of music...certainly NOT just film music!  If you listen only to film music you run the risk that your voice might turn out  be the voice of an impressionist.
Once your voice makes it presence known to you, it becomes easier to focus on what you want to say with it.  A beautiful voice is good..a beautiful voice with something to say is great!  That would be John Williams.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I&#039;ve found that the best way to find your sound is to keep on writing.&quot; -- spot on Ryan.

I would add: Trying to sound like someone else is nothing but a big distraction.
I believe the most direct path to creating your own sound is to pursue the things that strike you, the devices you&#039;re curious about and master them. Get input from a WIDE array of sources too.
It&#039;s also important to maintain a healthy perspective when studying others. i.e. take from them what you can, and be sure to incorporate it into what is you.

How do humans develop their personality? By being themselves, A LOT.
How do composers develop their own sound? By writing as themselves, A LOT.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I used to be obsessively concerned about finding my &quot;sound&quot;, or my &quot;voice&quot;. I&#039;m fascinated with Nadia Boulanger who&#039;s roster of students (including Philip Glass, Quincy Jones, Aaron Copland) all have vastly different but highly personal sounds.

When I saw Philip Glass do a Q&#038;A after a screening I realized that he never &quot;worked&quot; to find his voice, he just wrote the way that was inherent to him. Without even realizing it I was already beginning to develop my own sound and simply by writing music it would continue to develop.

		<description><![CDATA[Brilliant, just brilliant!  Couldn&#039;t agree more with all you said.  I really hope people take this to heart.

&quot;hey just want the sound. Then it is up to you. You have to then figure out a way to manipulate that sound—the sound that is YOU—so that it evolves and changes, yet to them, it is still that sound. But to you, it becomes something else.&quot;

This is amazing, just exactly right.  

PS: What did I do to have my name included in that illustrious list?  I must be offering bribes in my sleep again. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Deane,
Great article as always. When I was at school, trying to sound like a particular composer was all the rage (I&#039;m sure it&#039;s no different today). There was one guy there who was well known for being able to orchestrate exactly like JW. He knew all the subtle nuances of what makes Williams sounds like Williams. When one of my friends said something like, &quot;Isn&#039;t that amazing?&quot; I simply replied, &quot;There&#039;s only one composer I want to know that well and that&#039;s me.&quot; 

Bravo for continuing to think outside the box. ]]></description>
