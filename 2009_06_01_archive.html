<div id='summary2947494211605997421'><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/Skp5-DAsw4I/AAAAAAAAAIg/WvRg4Dmx5U0/s1600-h/sig-ogden.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/Skp5-DAsw4I/AAAAAAAAAIg/WvRg4Dmx5U0/s200/sig-ogden.png" /></a></div>When Jai asked me to talk about my Gateway Score &#8212; the score album that really grabbed me as a child and convinced me that scoring films is what I HAD to do for a living &#8212; I sort of froze at the thought of the assignment.<br />
<br />
"A real composer would talk about John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith, or Bernard Herrmann," I thought to myself. "When everyone hears my pick (insert Adam Sandler's famous little-boy-sad-face here)... <b><i>They're all gonna laugh at me!</i></b>"<br />
<br />
While I love action films and I flip out for science fiction on a pretty regular basis, I have always been the drama guy. I love a great drama, especially one that contains strong writing for the characters coupled by great performances. "<a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116695/" rel="imdb" title="Jerry Maguire">Jerry Maguire</a>" might be my favorite film of all-time, simply because of <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001081/" rel="imdb" title="Cameron Crowe">Cameron Crowe</a>'s ability to create characters of incredible depth which allowed each actor to carve out a performance of incredible depth. The story device used in "Jerry Maguire" &#8212; <i>rags-to-riches</i> followed by <i>life-lesson-learned</i> &#8212; is not new by any stretch of the imagination, yet is presented in a fresh and unique way, almost in reverse. "Jerry Maguire" is fundamentally an old-fashioned <i>dramedy</i>... a little bit of comedy, a lot bit of drama.<br />
<br />
For me, the <i>dramedy</i> was perfected in the mid-to-late eighties by a guy named <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hughes_%28director%29" rel="wikipedia" title="John Hughes (director)">John Hughes</a>. Hughes somehow brought the irreverence of Reagan-generation punk attitude to his filmmaking, creating characters that I could completely identify with. "Pretty In Pink", "<a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Club" rel="wikipedia" title="The Breakfast Club">The Breakfast Club</a>", and of course, "<a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferris_Bueller%27s_Day_Off" rel="wikipedia" title="Ferris Bueller's Day Off">Ferris Bueller's Day Off</a>" immediately come to mind. But I didn't become acutely aware of film music until my formative years teaching myself piano in the mid-to-late 1980's. By then, everybody was trying to be John Hughes, and the dramedy was THE genre to make if you were a filmmaker. Needless to say, I was digging most of them.<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SkqOGF6-WYI/AAAAAAAAAIo/CjZOom9VAI0/s1600-h/secret_of_my_success.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SkqOGF6-WYI/AAAAAAAAAIo/CjZOom9VAI0/s320/secret_of_my_success.jpg" /></a></div>I was also really taking notice and studying up on who was scoring all of them. Ira Newborn was huge back then, and the concept of the pop soundtrack album was really starting to take off. This all started to happen at about the same time a school buddy of mine who was also into film (future director Bryan Curb, who I would later work with here in Hollywood) gave me a cassette tape of David Foster's "The Symphony Sessions". That album contained a track called "Water Fountain", which was the love theme from the 1987 Michael J. Fox dramedy "<a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093936/" rel="imdb" title="The Secret of My Succe$s">The Secret of My Success</a>". Foster was hired to write the score for the film after director Herbert Ross heard his music for the smash hit "<a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090060/" rel="imdb" title="St. Elmo's Fire (film)">St. Elmo's Fire</a>".<br />
<br />
David Foster's "Water Fountain" theme really knocked me over, both on the soundtrack album to the film as well as the re-recording from "The Symphony Sessions", which featured Foster on piano backed by the Jeremy Lubbock conducted Vancouver Symphony. Back when thematic writing was still a practice that involved notes rather than "patches", Foster's melody is a beautifully crafted representation of a major modal theme that is complex in its simplicity.<br />
<br />
The rest of the score is motivic of both the "Water Fountain" theme and a secondary theme that Foster called the "Gazebo" theme, which is also just as lush and romantic as the former.<br />
<br />
The fact the a lot of people don't know that David Foster scored films as well as produced pop records in the 1980's is dwarfed only by the number of people who would even be aware that "The Secret of My Success" had any kind of actual score in it to begin with. However, I've spent the majority of my career trying to write music that made me feel like I did when I first heard that "Water Fountain" theme.<br />
<br />
Just when I think I'm getting close, I listen to it again and realize I have so far to go.<br />

<div class='post-body'>
<div id='summary1583354084959329712'><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hCspY__CLOo/Skj3KACZBfI/AAAAAAAAACc/js4yPKd_lFk/s1600-h/sig-sanders.png" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5352799908310615538" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hCspY__CLOo/Skj3KACZBfI/AAAAAAAAACc/js4yPKd_lFk/s400/sig-sanders.png" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 136px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 136px;" /></a>Strangely enough, it was quite a while before I owned an actual score album for <i>Star Wars</i>. My parents, in a moment of thrifty but well-intentioned genius, brought home the Electric Moog Orchestra LP for my consumption instead (!). I still have that album, by the way.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;">Maybe it was a sign, because I've been doing exactly that same thing&#8212;i.e., faking the sound of an orchestra with my synth rig&#8212;pretty much my whole career. It's something I've been specifically hired for again and again. So I have to thank the Electric Moog Orchestra for showing me the way.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;">&#8230;But enough on that! <i>Star Wars</i> was for me what I suspect it is for many people of a certain age: the film score to end all film scores. The inspiration to get into this crazy business. <b>The Grail</b>, as it were. Although that's a whole other John Williams score. :-)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;">George Lucas calls the six <i>Star Wars</i> pictures an homage to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_film">serial adventure film</a>, a cinematic tradition that dates back to some of the earliest silent films (and reached its apex during the heyday of the Hollywood studio system). The scores bear that out; in fact, they're crucial to making that connection. They are thematic, even leitmotivic. Their harmonic language is largely that of Romantic chromaticism. They are emotionally immediate and non-ironic.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;">So: Is this approach to film scoring even marginally relevant today? Is the contemporary audience so self-aware, so ironically detached, that this style of music has lost its ability to connect?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;">The curmudgeon in me wants to say that, sadly, we've moved on. Today's scores are all about the pad and the Big Drummy Drummy&#8230; with a little reverb-soaked duduk on top (Protip: filmmakers love duduk! Can't get enough of it!). Anything resembling a theme is straight-up heresy; traditional harmony is for suckers; the sound of a live orchestra is sort of hopelessly quaint. And on and on like that, until it starts to sound suspiciously like whining.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;">But reports of the Death of Traditional Film Scoring are premature. Listen to any episode of <i>24 </i>for a great example. Sure, Sean Callery handles a lot of the tense dialog scenes with creepy atmospheric synth pads and the occasional low drum thud (and is extremely effective in doing so&#8212;maximum respect to Sean). But he also integrates cues that take advantage of the power of theme, and of conventional harmony, and of all the emotional connections we still feel when we hear an orchestra or simply a noble horn line (the <i>24</i> Main Title encapsulates this perfectly). He's doing what composers have always done: integrating the old with the new, and finding ways to make it all connect with the audience.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;">Another example: Absolutely central to Michael Giacchino's "sound" is the fact that he uses a Real Live Orchestra, recorded old-school by Dan Wallin. You can hear every bow, every articulation, because they're <i>real</i>. Take a look at MG's creative output over the last two years, and, besides wondering when the man sleeps, you can't help but conclude that he's massively relevant on quantity alone.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;">As someone whose process often starts with themes and harmonies, I am happy and relieved to tell you: the influence of <i>Star Wars</i> is alive and well. The Force, to use the ending you must have seen coming a mile away, is still with us.</span><br />

<b><br />
</b><br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">As usual, this provocation seems just plain wrong on its face. Listening to soundtrack albums got me hooked this career in the first place&#8212;and I suspect it's the same for many of you. Without them, I'd likely be blogging about corporate law, or foreign policy, or some other interest that I parlayed into a life's work.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">On the other hand, maybe considering this provocation reminds us of the film score's necessary subservience to picture&#8230; or where we should be spending our time (is Photoshopping an album cover really more important than meeting with a filmmaker?)&#8230; or to whether, in a world with torrents and Pirate Bays, soundtrack albums even make sense anymore.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">Then, of course, there's also the issue of "soundtrack album vs. score album." Some people get picky about which is which&#8230; hop in here and let me know what this all suggests to you.</span></span></div>

<br />
If film composers are musicians that put music to film, then Michael Jackson was a musician who put film to music. In addition to his obvious contributions to the world of pop music, Michael Jackson produced some of the most innovative pieces of visual imagery in the form of the world's first long-play music videos.<br />
<br />
As a child of the 80's, I was fascinated to see what Michael Jackson would do next. I would just as eagerly anticipate the MTV countdown of a Michael Jackson World Premiere video as I would the next installment of the Indiana Jones series or the next Jim Cameron film. His sense of cinematic payoff was astounding, even up to his later videos of the 1990's and on into the new millennium.<br />
<br />
It has always been sad to me, and maybe a mark of where we've fallen down a bit as a people group, that we condemn those who we perceive as having done something before we are sure they did. I do not know what demons haunted Michael Jackson in his life, and for that matter, I don't know that <i>any</i> did. I just know the man that brought <i>Thriller</i> to my turntable, <i>Bad</i> to my mental production thoughtscape, and <i>Dangerous</i> to a musically clueless generation.<br />
<br />
That is how I will remember the man.<br />

Image by the awesome <a href="http://tomsdrawings.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Tom Jones</a></div>Admittedly this is my point of view, a conclusion drawn of my life experiences so far. They may change in the next ten years.  But, hey, so far being a bit of a <b>'One-Man-Band'</b> has worked for me, so it might just work for you <br />
;-)<br />
<br />
<h3>FOCUS</h3>Focusing on music and composition, and film music in particular, has never really been a problem for me. In fact, it's practically borderline obsession. I cannot remember a time when I didn't want to write or be involved somehow with the music of film.<br />
This led me to learn various instruments and then onto two music degrees, the latter in scoring picture, an invaluable experience, as it was here where I learned the similarities between composing music pieces and sound designing an entire soundtrack, using found or recorded sound to augment music or even be the basis for it.<br />
I took my narrow focus on just scoring film to the wider possibilities of, and the fun to be had with, film sound.<br />
After university I found even more so that diversifying my skill set led on to more contacts and opportunities. Recording sound on low budget short film sets led to an appreciation of well-recorded sound when I then brought them into the post-production studio... and also the necessity of learning ways of cleaning up less than optimal sound (that I vowed to record better the next time!).<br />
Using organizational and basic office skills as a production assistant in a local, small production office meant I also ended up being first choice for the recording and post-production sound, simply out of convenience for the producers, and they could pay me as a package deal, probably ending up cheaper for them than sourcing it out to separate facility houses.<br />
<br />
<h3>SKILLS</h3>Even if your office skills are pretty limited, the fact that you're a composing for film means that you've got a pretty broad skillset in other areas as it is. In the beginning it's vital to use them all to get you to that holy grail of composing for film (or theatre, television, commercials, whatever floats your boat).<br />
You're probably pretty good with computers and related kit - get work in kit hire, and find out about all the films that are hiring kit perhaps by making friends with your regular clients.<br />
If you've been freelance or self-employed for any length of time, you'll develop some pretty awesome motivational and organizational skills (if you don't you won't be in work very long!). How might you put those to good use in some line of work that may put you in the line of fire for a composing role? Or even pay the bills so you have enough free time to compose music and build up your credits?<br />
I found that working in music sequencers and timelines actually translates well to working in Macromedia Flash, which led to designing my own fancy website and then a few more for friends and friends of friends. After realizing that Flash websites get no love from search engines, some of the coding skills used in Flash translate over to working in html etc., which led to a little more web design.  Maybe you could design websites to fund your addiction to writing music for film?<br />
You probably play at least one instrument. Whether it's through teaching or playing at functions, there's easy cash to be made there, with very little time investment involved. You've already put in all the hard work learning to play the damn thing...<br />
Honestly... at the very least being able to offer not only composition but sound design, foley, and mixes on short films and contemporary theatre really has gotten me more work. If I can offer it as a package, I save the client hassle and quite a bit of dosh. It's gotten me more credits, more contacts and lots more word-of-mouth recommendations than if all I could do was crank out the tunes.<br />
Or at the very least, it's kept the roof over my head. And, let's face it, more importantly, my studio. :-)<br />
<br />
<h3>JACK OF ALL TRADES?<br />
</h3>Does diversifying mean you become a 'jack of all trades, master of none'? This really depends on you: how far are you willing to go to get the opportunities to put your foot on the ladder, or even later down the line, to continue to work in the industry when the credit crunch finally hits your neck of the woods (though this has yet to happen in mine, and I'm keeping fingers crossed it'll continue this way. However, you never know what the future may bring - it's always good to have contingencies!)?<br />
The trick is to not worry too much about being the greatest in the world at every single one of the skills you offer, but instead aim to be the best you can be at the ones you love and at least pretty competent at the ones that pay.<br />
Face it, even if you work only on composition, out of the billions of people on the planet there will always be someone who's better than you, after all!<br />
Embrace this knowledge, work hard at getting better and enjoy the journey.<br />
Focus 100% on your role in the project at hand, learn everything you can from the experience, give it all you've got and you'll come away from the experience better at that role than you were before. You may also come away feeling like you never want to do it again... but that's a whole other post waiting to be written...<br />
<b>FULL CIRCLE<br />
</b><br />
It's even got to the point now where I have so much work on, I'm able to outsource a little of the basic stuff like tracklaying and simple foley... which means I have more time to focus on the music, the sound design, the experimentation, the fun stuff, and so the client still gets more bang for their buck.<br />
Which (hopefully!) leads to even more word-of-mouth recommendations!<br />
I started with composition and will probably end my career there, for that's where my true passion lies, but I would never have got there had I not diversified and got as much mileage out of the associated skills as I have.<br />
And I certainly wouldn't have had as much fun along the way. Variety is, after all, the spice of life.<br />
Sometimes it's good to be a one-man-band.<br />

In case you haven't been following along, so far we've listened to over two hours of Jerry Goldsmith giving one of his final interviews with John Burlingame, and an hour of Sandy Courage talking about all things Star Trek &#8212; two giants responsible for some of the film industry's most respected and memorable music.<br /><br />Now, I want to shift our focus from the 60's to the 70's and 80's. This interview is priceless, and if you are looking to learn from someone who has done more television than anyone else on the planet, look no further than the great <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006236/">Mike Post</a>.<br /><br />LA Law, The Rockford Files, The A-Team, Hill Street Blues, Magnum PI, Hunter, Quantum Leap, Doogie Howser MD, NYPD Blue, Law and Order... I mean, you tell me another guy who has had the success of Mike Post.<br /><br />This is a 6-part oral history of Post's career. Do yourself a favor: Take two hours today or tonight and write down everything you can from this interview. This should really be a film music school class all by itself. Pay particular attention to Parts 3 and 4 of this interview to *really* hear how scoring for TV works on the professional level.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=DEE9DB4D6396E145&amp;playnext=1&amp;playnext_from=PL">Click here to start learning...</a><br /><br />   <div style="margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;" class="zemanta-pixie"><a class="zemanta-pixie-a" href="http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/f1c9306e-eba8-4d25-9545-70cef3416ec8/" title="Reblog this post [with Zemanta]"><img style="border: medium none ; float: right;" class="zemanta-pixie-img" src="http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=f1c9306e-eba8-4d25-9545-70cef3416ec8" alt="Reblog this post [with Zemanta]" /></a><span class="zem-script more-related pretty-attribution"><script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js" defer="defer"></script></span></div></div>

From January through March of 1987, TV Land did something that really changed me as a human (Yes, I'm <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> impressionable... or at least I was back then).<br />
<br />
I was a latch-key kid and I relished my after-school freedom, which for those three short months, I had down to a pat ritual: School got out at 3pm, and the bus dropped me at the entrance to our cul-de-sac at about 3:45. If I put a box of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese on by 4:10, it would be ready by 4:30, which was when Nickelodeon's <span style="font-style: italic;">Lancelot Link: Secret Chimp</span> came on. During Lancelot's third commercial break at 4:50, I could grab dessert in the form of a Klondike Bar (or two!), and be back on the couch and comfortable for the 5 o'clock reason for the whole routine to begin with... <span style="font-style: italic;">Planet of the Apes: The Series</span> on TV Land, with music by Lalo Schifrin.<br />
<br />
Even though I had not seen anything from the POTA feature film franchise, and was not yet aware of Jerry Goldsmith's music for the original, I was completely in love with Lalo Schifrin's incredible use of percussion and 12-tone modes. Yes, it was all derivative of what JG cooked up in the first film, but I was hooked from day one of discovering <span style="font-style: italic;">TV Land's </span>special short run of the show.<br />
<br />
Lalo Schifrin has composed the scores for a vast catalog of landmark films and television programming, including the classics <span style="font-style: italic;">Enter the Dragon</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Bullitt</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Osterman Weekend</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Cincinnati Kid</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Cool Hand Luke</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Dirty Harry</span>, and the ever popular <span style="font-style: italic;">Rush Hour</span> franchise (not to mention my personal favorite, <span style="font-style: italic;">Charley Varrick</span>). But as deep as his scope of work is, it is still Schifrin's theme for the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mission: Impossible</span> television show (and subsequent feature film franchise) that is undoubtedly his most famous work, and a piece of music that to this day frustrates music students trying to compose in 5/4 while avoiding Schifrin's indelible "2 on 3" subdivision.<br />
<br />
It's an interesting thing to realize that you cannot, by good measure, write something in 5/4 and above 110 bpm without consciously trying to avoid the feel of Schifrin's <span style="font-style: italic;">MI</span> theme. When a composer is able to lend a voice to a film or show in such a great way as he did with that theme, whether by feel, tone, melody, or instrumentation, it is a remarkable thing. There are only a handful of composers who have been able to "lay claim"to a certain musical idea that ended up being almost bigger than the film it embodied. Those are the scores that, when heard independently of the films they accompany, transport you back to the exact moment when you first experienced that visual.<br />
<br />
Additional examples of this phenomenal ability to transport a listener might include:<br />
<ol><li>Jerry Goldsmith's trumpet triplets from <span style="font-style: italic;">"Patton"</span></li>
<li>Ennio Morricone's 2-note soprano flute melody for <span style="font-style: italic;">"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"</span></li>
<li>The marimbas of Thomas Newman's <span style="font-style: italic;">"American Beauty</span>" score</li>
<li>Bernard Hermann's shrieking shower scene violins in <span style="font-style: italic;">"Psycho"</span><br />
</li>
</ol>As a composer, it is a rare gift to be able to successfully give a film a musical identifier. It takes the right combination of placement and filmic understanding to achieve a proper balance and an exact fit. Many composers have attempted it with less than stellar results, while it seems that others don't try real hard and it just comes naturally to them. The trend right now in our business is to "vibe" the style of a certain composer or a score of a certain composer. If I had a nickel for every demo CD I've heard that sounded like every other demo CD I've heard, I'd be a very rich man.<br />
<br />
Which brings up today's Composers' Confab question: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Can a composer be </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">truly</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> <span style="font-style: italic;">unprecedented</span> in today's film music environment?</span> Are the days of absolute originality gone in film music? Was James Horner right when he suggested that all of the notes will be used eventually, thus self-plagiarism is inevitable? Are there any recognizable film music "pioneers" on the scene that might possibly one day ascend to the level of a "Morricone" or "Schifrin"? Do composers try so hard to distinguish themselves from the rest of the pack that they lose focus on the task at hand &#8212; writing the score?<br />

We're still finding the best schedule for all this content we're creating on SCOREcast, and it seems like the weekend is a good time for mulling over the kinds of issues we tackle here.<br />
<br />
Remember, as always, that these provocations aren't necessarily to be taken literally&#8212;they're intended to spur discussion and to prompt new perspectives. There is no right or wrong answer, in other words.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Provocation:&nbsp;Composers should charge as little as possible for their work.</span><br />
<b><br />
</b><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">OK, <i>now</i> we're getting serious. Hitting where it counts&#8230; in the pocketbook. Film composers are one of the few groups in Hollywood that aren't represented by a union. The Musician's Union (Local 47 in Los Angeles) represents players, orchestrators, conductors, copyists, etc.&#8212;but not composers. When it comes to setting our fees, we're on our own. Should we really low-ball ourselves into oblivion? On the face of it, this provocation seems like a really <i>rotten</i> business plan.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">For me, though, this provocation brings to mind a piece of wisdom from Richard Bellis: "In this business, there are three things: <b>good</b>, <b>fast</b> and <b>cheap</b>. Don't ever let your client have more than two out of three."</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Deciding what to charge, and when to score a project for less than our usual rate&#8212;these are incredibly personal subjects. So I wouldn't presume to offer advice here. If you <i>are</i> sacrificing on the budget-side, though, you ought to be getting something substantial in return: more musicians, more equity in the project&#8230; something. To quote Bellis again: "Always know why you're taking the gig." Saying "yes" to a project just so you can call yourself a professional composer, in other words, shouldn't really be enough.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">At the very least, you should insist on keeping the rights to the music you create! There has to be a balance at some point; otherwise, you're just being used. And that makes your filmmaking collaborators <i>users</i>.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Taken less literally, "charging as little as possible" could mean asking as little as possible in terms of things other than money. Keeping our personal drama out of the work space. Making sure our communications are focused. Hitting our deadlines.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Thinking of our provocation this way leads me to a terrific metaphor, which I first heard from Mike Post:</span></span><br />
<div><div>"A producer is basically a guy with a big desk. The desk has dozens of drawers, and inside each drawer something is <i>on fire</i>. The producer's job is to go around putting out all the fires. So we composers want to be that one drawer the producer <i>never</i> has to waste time opening&#8212;there's never a fire there."<br />
<br />
Whatever it takes to give them that confidence, in other words, is worth doing. That's one way in which this provocation could be true&#8212;but there have to be some others. For once, I'm a little stumped by my own provocation, so jump in with some comments and let me know what you think.</div></div></div>

Most likely, the causes of these are the fact that there's a lot of change going on in my life right now - I'm finishing up my current job, I'm going to see my girlfriend for the first time in 3 months soon, and a load of other things.   Anyway....I digress.  I've been having some cool "music" dreams lately - I'm sure a lot of you can all relate.<br /><br />One of my latest dreams that I can remember was being in a concert, and the orchestra was playing my music - in real-time as I composed it! In my dream, I understood the entire workings of the orchestra, and exactly how to compose great orchestral music.  It was like a revelation - a light bulb went on somewhere, and I suddenly understood it all.  Then I woke up...<br /><br />I'm curious to see what kind of dreams you guys have - I've had everything from playing the most amazing music on a church organ, to going shopping for guitars, and trying to drag a Gibson SG out of my dream with my as I woke up.  So share your experiences! Let us know what kind of crazy musical dreams you've had!</div>

So I want to begin my column here on SCOREcast with what I'm going to try to cover&#8212;which is nearly everything&#8212;and a few words about my plan of attack.<br />
<br />
I like to work "big to small." In other words, I try to start with the overarching concept, and then work out the details as I go. That way, if I've omitted anything, you have the larger context, and can figure out the details yourself. If you're cool with that, read on&#8230;<br />
<br />
Today's Big Picture has to do with self-assessment, and it's a metaphor from (American) football: coaches talk about their teams' performance in terms of <span style="font-style: italic;">phases of the game</span>. In football, the three phases are offense, defense and special teams (like kicking field goals or returning punts).<br />
<br />
A coach might say: "We dominated the offensive phase of the game today. But we got beat on special teams, and those twelve field goals (!) they scored really hurt us." What he's saying is that his team had a critical <span style="font-style: italic;">imbalance</span>&#8212;one facet of their performance wasn't up to standard. And the team's overall game suffered as a result.<br />
<br />
Football teams that excel in one phase of the game can win individual contests; they might even beat a particular opponent regularly (they "match up well" against a certain defense, e.g.). Teams that are strong in every phase of the game, though&#8230; those teams have the potential to become legend.<br />
<br />
So it is with us as composers. We're talking about diversity this month, and I think a good way to approach this topic is to look at our own diversity. What are we great at? Where do our skills fall down? How can we target our efforts to improve?<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Here's a little quiz:</span> rate yourself from one to five in each area. A one indicates little or no experience; a five is world-class mastery. Be honest&#8212;no one's looking at this but you. I've picked areas that I've found to be important in my own career; your mileage may vary, but I doubt it'll vary by much.<br />
<br />
Some of the "phases of the game" I'm including below are crucial; others are merely <span style="font-style: italic;">important</span> from time to time or if you're wanting to break into a certain area of the biz. The quiz is primarily aimed at composers, though many of the topics apply to anyone in our crazy little corner of the music world.<br />
<br />
Once you've taken the quiz, rate yourself. You've created a snapshot of your skill set&#8212;and now you can analyze that data. What does the graph of your skill set look like? How would you like it to look in six months&#8230; a year&#8230; five years? What's the best way to get there?<br />
<br />
You may decide to play to your strengths by beefing up the phases in which you're already strong&#8230; or shore up those phases where you aren't. That's up to you. I hope this tool will be valuable, though, no matter where you find yourself in your career.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Music composiiton: Plain ol' tonal harmony</span><br />
1. Piano sound pretty! Sometimes&#8230;<br />
2. I have a basic understanding of scales and simple common practice period harmonization.<br />
3. I can perform a Roman-numeral analysis of, say, a Bach chorale.<br />
4. Secondary dominants, predominant chords and chromaticism are familiar territory to me.<br />
5. Tonality is my playground&#8212;to be used or transcended at will.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Music composition: Advanced harmony/modern techniques</span><br />
1. Um, why are all those ugly notes in there?<br />
2. I've studied a few serial and atonal works, and can "think in octatonic" or other scale forms.<br />
3. Alternate tunings and notations; minimalism; musique concrete&#8230; I'm cool with all that.<br />
4. I'm just as comfortable writing outside the tonal system as I am working within it.<br />
5. The full range of sonic expression is at my fingertips. I'm involved in creating what comes next.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Music composition: Contemporary</span><br />
1. Who is this Diddy of which you speak?<br />
2. I can crank out a lead sheet.<br />
3. I've studied production in one or more styles: Jazz, Hip Hop, Latin, etc.<br />
4. I work regularly in one or more contemporary/popular music genres.<br />
5. Whatever a client needs, I can deliver&#8212;regardless of style.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Orchestration</span><br />
1. Hey, the big instruments play lower! Handy to remember, huh?<br />
2. I know the instrumental families and have a pretty good grasp of ranges.<br />
3. I understand balance and blend, and know the idiomatic tendencies of most standard instruments.<br />
4. Orchestration is an integral, instinctual part of my process from the moment I conceive a musical idea.<br />
5. I could teach Ravel a thing or two.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Conducting</span><br />
1. Floor, wall, wall, ceiling&#8230; but what if the cue is in 3/4?<br />
2. I know basic conducting patterns and recording session protocol.<br />
3. I'm comfortable at the podium, conducting for a variety of ensembles and/or styles.<br />
4. My skills and experience allow me to interpret a performance&#8212;not just survive it&#8212;regardless of the musical terrain.<br />
5. I am a professional conductor.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mixing</span><br />
1. &#8230;These go to eleven.<br />
2. I understand basic signal path, but my mixes aren't consistently solid.<br />
3. I have a strategy for building my mixes and a set of go-to tools for fixing problems.<br />
4. My mixes are an expression of my musical opinion and personality, executed with the same control as the writing itself.<br />
5. I'm a full-time professional mixer.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Performance</span><br />
1. Never picked up a musical instrument in my life (um&#8230; seriously?)<br />
2. I've dabbled on one or more instruments, but never taken lessons.<br />
3. I've studied, but wouldn't be comfortable putting my performances on recordings.<br />
4. I'm a competent musician on one or more instruments.<br />
5. I'm a full-time professional musician.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Gear: Hardware</span><br />
1. I haven't really started thinking about my own studio. I have a computer, but no other gear.<br />
2. I can use my computer to record sound. Not that it's sound someone would pay actual money for (yet&#8230;).<br />
3. I have a functioning home studio, but I'd like to expand in order to get a better sound.<br />
4. My home/project studio is more than simply adequate&#8212;it's a resource, and sometimes an inspiration.<br />
5. Those guys at Remote Control&#8230; they're cool and all, but they need more gear.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Gear: Library</span><br />
1. You mean people sell sounds? That you can buy? Weird!<br />
2. I have a basic set of samples, but nothing fancy or exotic.<br />
3. My studio is armed with a reasonable variety of samples, loops, virtual instruments, synths, etc.<br />
4. I can call up pretty much any sound I need, in nearly any style I'd be asked to write.<br />
5. If it's out there, I own it. If it's not out there yet, I'm probably beta-testing it.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Gear: Expertise</span><br />
1. I know where the ON switch is, but I'm a little afraid to start pushing buttons.<br />
2. Where's that manual again? I'm digging in, but have a lot to learn.<br />
3. I can run my gear with no problem, but some of the power-user commands are a mystery.<br />
4. I have my own macros/custom key bindings for sequencing, and each piece of gear is optimized for my work flow.<br />
5. I build my own electronic gear and/or work as a developer for a manufacturer.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Film Music History</span><br />
1. Buncha old guys wrote some tunes. What's the big deal?<br />
2. I know the basic history of the art form, and a few of the "big names."<br />
3. I've listened to numerous scores from across the decades, and have a working knowledge of film music history.<br />
4. I've written (term papers count) about multiple film composers, studied scores old and new, and can identify style and approximate historical period from a "needle-drop."<br />
5. Bring it on, Tony Thomas&#8230; I am a veritable Film Music History encyclopedia.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Film History</span><br />
1. Nouvelle vague&#8230; emphasis on the vague.<br />
2. I know about Rosebud and Tara and Rick's. The classics, in other words.<br />
3. I've studied the basics of the history of cinema around the world.<br />
4. I've done in-depth research and/or read widely in the field. I might even own some Rohmer-era issues of Cahiers du cinéma.<br />
5. I can pontificate for hours about the relative merits of, say, Huang Jianxin versus Wong Kar-wai.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Film Terminology</span><br />
1. Words of the day: Director, camera, movie.<br />
2. Dutch angle, cinematographer, pickups.<br />
3. Slug line, walla, cigarette burns.<br />
4. Brute, overcranking, chromakey.<br />
5. Abby Singer, diegesis, zoopraxis.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Organization</span><br />
1. I wanted to finish this quiz, but I forgot the website location. And I lost my laptop.<br />
2. Car keys and the rent&#8212;I'm pretty good about the obvious stuff.<br />
3. I have an organizational system in place, and attend to it fairly regularly.<br />
4. I create my own custom templates in FileMaker/Excel/Numbers.<br />
5. My backups have backups, and nothing is more than a keystroke or two away. Total organizational control.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Personal Presentation:</span><br />
1. Dorito-stained t-shirt? Check. Spinach in my teeth? Check. Let's take a meeting!<br />
2. I have reasonably good interpersonal skills.<br />
3. People say I'm a good hang&#8230; and it doesn't mean they want to hang me.<br />
4. I've spent time and energy&#8212;and money&#8212;cultivating an image, an impression. But I'm not, like, a jerk about it.<br />
5. It's like there's an aura around me. I am an "it" machine.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Team-Building</span><br />

<br />
This month, I'd like to discuss the topic of diversifying at the beginning of your career and whether it is beneficial or detrimental - in both the long run and the short run.  I'll be basing these observations mainly on my own experiences, so please don't feel that anything I say is the "final word" on the subject - I believe you should always try it yourself and make your own conclusion, but there's definitively advantages to seeing it from someone else's perspective.<br />
<br />
First off - what do we mean by "diversifying"? I'm talking about composing in multiple genres, and for a wide range of media.  Lets look at just a few of the the different types of media out there, which at some point or another require music:<br />
<br />
- Film (Student films, short films, trailers)<br />
- Animations (Cartoon, CG)<br />
- Video Games (Flash, Mods, Amateur, Low Budget, iPhone)<br />
- Websites (Background tracks)<br />
- Presentations (Office etc.)<br />
- On Hold Music<br />
- Wedding Music/Backing Tracks for singers<br />
<br />
The list is endless when you take a look around at plethora of areas you hear music being used in every day.<br />
<br />
I firmly believe that the more types of media you compose for, the greater your chances of success as a composer, and so have been composing for all of these since the beginning of my career.  However, you may be thinking right now "this guy is an idiot - I want to compose for films, not bloody wedding music!".  Well in one sense, yes you are right - its not the avenue you want to go down, however, what will you learn from venturing down that path? What will you discover about yourself? What will you learn how to do that you didn't previously know how to do? How will your style evolve from composing for that type of media?<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd like to show you guys a quick list of places where you can find these types of job opportunities.  Below are just a few cool sites where you can start off with:<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://modbb.com/">Modbb</a> - this is a website for game modding enthusiasts and has some really great projects going on all the time.  Take a look around and seeing whats being done - remember - all of these modded games are going to need music/sounds, so your skills could be required<br />
<br />
<a href="http://forums.studentfilms.com/eve/forums/a/frm/f/6156029451">StudentFilms </a>-a forum for low budget films - plenty of job opportunities on here for you to start off your career<br />
<br />
<a href="http://humtoo.com/">Humtoo</a>- Interesting site where composers battle it out to have their music used for the project.  Worth having a look at the site to see whats on offer.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://forums.cgsociety.org/">CGtalk </a>- Some amazing digital artists on here, with some seriously cool projects sometimes.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://animationforum.net/">Animation forum</a> - Great small forum with some good animators on it - I've had a few job opportunities from this site just by posting on here, and answering some questions for people.<br />
<br />
So go hang out at these places, talk, get to know people, make contacts, and leave a link to your website in your signature. You'll be suprised how many projects you could be offered, once you start to get your name around on them.<br />
<br />
To round all of this up - what has all of this got to do with composing for film? Well I suppose I was kind of rambling for most of this post, but the main point that I want to get across to you is its all about who you know and who knows you.  The more types of media you compose for, the more networks of people your name is going to be spread along - and as we all know, the industry is all about networking.</div>

I'd like to talk about diversifying in a different light - being a diverse <span style="font-style: italic;">collaborator</span>.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Diverse collaboration</span> to me means that in this process of filmmaking you are a <span style="font-style: italic;">solution</span>, not a <span style="font-style: italic;">problem</span>. It means possessing the skillset to creatively and intuitively behave your team <span style="font-style: italic;">out</span> of the tight spots that others might have behaved your team <span style="font-style: italic;">in</span> to. It doesn't just mean that you can write great music for any number of situations or scenes, but also that you are solid in a room, you know how to treat people, you know your gear, and that you follow through on tasks delegated to you. In fact, your diversity as a collaborator might be one of the greatest assets you can provide a director who has hired you to score his or her film.<br />
<br />
And it's not always easy &#8211; diversity and flexibility as a collaborator can be tough. You have to be on your toes as much as on your guard. In the post-production process, schedules are tight and claustrophobic which tends to create tension and sometimes friction amongst those being held responsible to pull off a miracle at the eleventh hour. I have found that in times like these, when directors are almost always already on the edge of insanity, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Whatever you can do at this point insure a smoother ride for them, do <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span>.<br />
<br />
There are some simple work habits that have helped me collaborate well with people over the years. Each of these suggestions are basic yet important fundamentals that I've held fast to and tried not to deviate from. This list is itself a diverse one &#8211; some of these ideas are technical, while others are philosophical in nature. Each of them, however, has played an important role in my business, guarantying a smooth working collaboration every time.<br />
<br />
In this, my first "Tao" column, I'll attempt to define some of them, and then I wanna hear yours!<br />
<br />
<ol><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">NEVER play a director a cue that you don't really love.</span><br />
These are in no particular order, but this might be the most important one in the bunch. I've done it both ways in my career- I've submitted something I thought was absolutely perfect for the scene, and then on one particular occasion, I thought I'd be "smart" and submit two things: one that I thought was perfect, and one that I thought was lame and would most assuredly guarantee that the director choose the first one. Yep...you guessed it. The director chose the lame one, and I was forced to run with it. Now every time I hear that cue in that particular movie, I cringe. NEVER ever ever ever play the director a cue that you aren't 200% in love with.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Demo in as much detail as possible.</span><br />
"The more you show, the more you'll know." &#8211; Christopher Young.<br />
Directors don't speak "music". It is up to you to utilize your mock-ups to determine what it is that they like about what they are hearing, as much as what they don't like about it. Ask a lot of questions. Upon them saying, "Yeah, that just doesn't work for me", find out "Why". Is it an instrument they don't like, or an entire melody line? The former is easy to fix, the latter... not so much. More often than not, less is more in a film score so the more color you add to your mock-ups (assuming your thematic material has already been approved), the more opportunity there is to strip away layers until they finally hear what they like.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Save EVERY version of EVERY cue.</span><br />
I'll never forget one time while working on a pivotal cue for an action scene, I saved what I thought was the best version of the cue that I had come up with yet. The problem was that I saved it over the top of the prior version. But that's okay, cuz this one was better, right?! I played the cue for the director, and he confirmed what I had told myself would never happen in a million years: "Yeah that's cool, but I liked the last one better! It had something this one doesn't." FRICK! Moral of the story? Save every damn thing you do. You never know what is going to catch their ear and what isn't, even if you think you know.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Find out who the boss is, and deal only with them.</span><br />
Never accept a job where a committee of 10 people must approve each cue revision. You'll end up taking a great score and turning it into a giant pile of crap trying to please a committee. If I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times: "Approval by committee never ever works!" Find out who the decision maker is and work ONLY with them. If there is no single decision maker (Hint: its usually the director), then don't accept the job. You'll thank yourself for it later. That said, there are exceptions to every rule. On "The Way Home", I had two decision makers &#8211; the director AND the producer &#8211; but they functioned as one. If one of them approved something, it was understood by all that I had my "final approval". This worked flawlessly, and given the time pressure of our deadline, it HAD to.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Triple check your mixes against dialog and FX.</span><br />
You aren't the only contractor working on the project at this stage in the game. Make sure you are communicating with all department heads, ie. mix engineer, lead foley artist, dialog editors, etc. Check your mixes against the scenes - never skip this step, even if you are in a rush. There's nothing worse than getting to a dub and having to concede that your music be buried in the mix because it conflicts with more important elements in the film. And remember - Dialog will take priority every time. No exceptions. Never try to compete with it. You'll simply lose that battle.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Give the film YOUR voice. Try to avoid trends and gimmicks.</span><br />
An original score is a huge investment in trust and belief in you by your employers. Creating a trendy/gimmicky score will result in it sounding outdated and cheap in two years. Your director/producers deserve more and have paid the price to bring you in. Don't skimp by simply stringing something together using the latest loops and plugins that every single other composer is using. Be original and come up with something that will "brand" their movie in people's ears and minds, and never ever be afraid to inject your personality into your scores. After all, they hired YOU for a reason.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Create simple motifs and themes.</span><br />
Don't get too complex with your themes and motifs. Don't use more than two or three themes or two or three motifs to identify those themes. Even the heaviest symphonic scores are simple in their effectiveness. John Williams is the obvious master of this tactic. Listen to how he brilliantly reuses motivic ideas throughout his entire score, never deviating far from the original theme or idea. A score that is too complex serves to do nothing but dilute the storyline and take the viewers attention off of where it should be.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Create "threads".</span><br />
Building on my last point, I like to think of the score as a big quilt that wraps itself around a film. The "quilt" (score) is made up of dozens of "blocks" (cues) and each block has within it several "threads" that associate each block with the rest of the quilt. Once you have a theme that supports the film well, check to see if there's a way to use only one line of the theme in other themes to help "thread" the score together. In your film score, there are all kinds of ways to "state a theme" without really stating it within the context of its original useage. Additionally, the "thread" can also be the use of some sort of instrument that lends identity to the score. Think of what Mark Isham did in "Crash" with a female solo voice juxtaposed against a thick liquidy wash of synthesizers. "Threads" are everything in helping to give the film a musical identity.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Think big.</span><br />
As an independent film composer, by the time the producers are ready for your music, there is not much room left in the budget. Yet, the everyone has met and its unanimous: Real instruments - maybe even a large orchestra "would sound amazing on this film!" Well, yes, that might be true, but the reality is that you can't get something for nothing. Or can you? Online networking has opened up so many more possibilities that weren't there even a year ago, and the reality is that in today's technological age, it IS possible to get together a group of people who would love nothing more than to get their names on something that Hollywood is up to. So think big. Don't let the "budget" paint you into a corner that really doesn't exist. Many times I've recorded a decent orchestra on a shoe-string budget for a film that, in my opinion as the composer, really needed an orchestral sound. It is always worth turning over every rock and calling in every marker to get something bigger than everyone thinks is even possible when people are looking to you to deliver something amazing. So, go on, be the hero and save the day! You'll get hired again by giving more than you are being asked to give. Everyone wants someone like that on their team.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Over Communicate.</span><br />
Okay... forget #1! THIS might be the most important one of the bunch! Dale Carnegie said, "The worst thing you can do in business is leave people to their own wondering." So true. You can never communicate too much. It's impossible. Find out how your client likes to communicate, whether by email, phone, fax, iChat, whatever... and DO IT TO DEATH! Tell them everytime you revise something, rewrite something, notice something in the picture that you didn't notice before... anything to help them understand that you are working hard for them and doing what they've asked you to do (and sometimes what they HAVEN'T asked you to do!). NEVER let your creative team not hear from you in days. That's the cardinal sin. The score is likely the first time that the creative team has let go of the project to an outside independent creative talent like yourself, and they need reassurance that you are not killing the "baby" they just spent the last two years of their life carrying.<br />
</li>
</ol><br />
Sometimes, part of being <span style="font-style: italic;">diverse</span> means being flexible and ready to do whatever it takes. The job of a film composer is one of service to the director and service to the film itself. We cannot afford to be unbendable or unteachable in our careers. Being diverse in how you handle situations and flexible in how you handle stress and obstacles is vital to your success in this business. Some of it will come with time and learning the hard way, but most of it can come with common sense and solid planning.<br />
<br />
This is <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">my</span> list - if you have a few of your own, I'd love to hear them!</div>

<br />
These techno toys we deal with can be very intimidating at times. Some of us are just not that technical and we don&#8217;t want to be, while others love combing through the manual and look forward to the challenges of taking on a new piece of gear. (In a future issue we will talk about GAS (Gear Acquisition Syndrome).<br />
<br />
So what exactly do we have to deal with in our studios on a daily basis? Computers, mixing consoles, DAW controllers, audio interfaces, microphones, patch bays, word clock generators, stereo recorders, MIDI interfaces, MIDI sound modules, and not to mention all the different pieces of software you may use. And, let&#8217;s not forget our countless connections: Analog, Digital, MIDI, Ethernet, Video, Internet, etc. If you&#8217;re Deane, you probably have a fiber optic cable connected to your forehead as well.<br />
<br />
When you sit down with pencil and paper, notation software, or your DAW, you want to turn on your right brain and go to it without thinking &#8220;is this hooked up correctly, how come I can&#8217;t hear the percussion tracks, and why are the lights dimming around my neighborhood.&#8221; (Unless, that is your mood lighting.)<br />
<br />
Joe Trapanese mentions in his <a href="2009/06/composer-as-producer-maximizing-your.html">column</a> that using templates is key to kicking your project off on the right foot. I have to agree that these are probably one of the most significant timesavers and methods to improve your creative muse.<br />
<br />
So let&#8217;s talk specifically about the template in your sequencer or DAW. This template is really nothing more than a blank session that you have pre-configured to have all of your tracks/channels, routing, groupings, stems, and effects laid out in a way that makes your workflow smooth. Some composers use predominantly MIDI tracks and few audio tracks, while others use more audio tracks than MIDI. I have composer friends who may have separate tracks for every piece of the orchestra, percussion, and separate drum tracks. This can easily put you over 100 tracks. Do you need just a few key orchestral instruments? Are you composing with guitar and perhaps need 4-6 audio tracks as well? These are some of the questions to ask. How do I work best? What is the end result? A full mockup score to be redone later on during the scoring stage, or is this a lower budget piece that will use everything as played in your DAW. Whatever your result, start by adding these tracks to your blank template.<br />
<br />
Before you do this, I recommend you sit down and spend a few hours or more laying out how you typically score and what are the technical logistics of your studio.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
Start with a list like this:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Small Orchestral Pop Template</span><br />
<br />
* 5 external MIDI modules with stereo outputs using 2 MIDI channels on each module<br />
* One GigaSampler with 16 MIDI and16 digital audio outputs via ADAT<br />
* 10 internal Soft synths fed to outputs 1-4 on audio interface<br />
* 8 audio channels in DAW for loops, FX, etc.<br />
* All audio outputs run to external mixer<br />
* Mixer control levels and control room monitoring<br />
* Mixer feeds DAW inputs 1-2 for mixdown<br />
<br />
A list similar to this can help you visualize exactly what you have and how things need to be connected and laid out in your DAW. Remember, the goal is to make things easy and simplistic.<br />
<br />
From here, start to build out your template by adding tracks and testing them. Make sure your MIDI routing is correct and that you can hear the correct synths, soft synths, etc. If you are using a more complex setup, i.e. multiple computers and MIDI over LAN, these things take time to set up and trouble shoot if you encounter problems. So again, give yourself some time to be able to work out the kinks. You&#8217;re a composer &#8211; you don&#8217;t care that you may need an Ethernet crossover cable instead of a straight through, but your gear does.<br />
<br />
Make sure to save your template after every modification.<br />
<br />
If you&#8217;re using a soft sampler, make sure you have the instances loaded and a stereo or multiple output version configured. If you are pre-loading samples, then load them to their associated channels and test the MIDI and audio routing. (In a future issue we will talk about getting samplers to run outside of your DAW and the 32-bit memory limitation.)<br />
<br />
If you are using any type of stems or sub groups, get those added in, and make sure your internal audio buses are working correctly. (Tip: Use a pre-recorded audio test tone on your tracks (audio) to test the audio outputs as well as aux and group busing.)<br />
<br />
Add any internal or even external effects to your aux sends, individual tracks, groups, etc.<br />
<br />
So we have our template saved with all of our tracks, groups, synths, samplers and effects. One last and very important thing we need to do is validate that your CPU is worthy of your template. One thing I like to do as a test is, using a stopwatch, time how long the template takes to open. If you have many soft samplers in your template and they are loading samples, this could take a while depending on your drive speed and whether you&#8217;re using RAID or not. This seems trivial but is actually quite useful if you know it takes 3 minutes to open, you could go get a cup of coffee or a glass of wine, while you&#8217;re waiting. This time is also important to know if you have to make any changes to the audio system settings. In Digital Performer for example, every time you open and close the audio driver settings, or change the buffer size, DP must reload the entire contents of the project, so count on another 3 minutes. This can definitely steal your Mojo. This I know first hand as I am currently in DP therapy for cursing at the computer screen during this time.<br />
<br />
Record some MIDI and audio data to make sure the CPU can handle all you&#8217;ve just asked it to. You may have to change your buffer while recording and again during playback based on the speed of your system, at which point you can join me in therapy. :-)<br />
<br />
So once we have our template finalized and working, we can now start writing that award winning Opus without the gear potentially getting in the way and blaming your soft synth for ruining your Oscar nomination.<br />
<br />
Now some of you might be thinking about our good friend Murphy, and saying sometimes he likes to visit at the worst of times. Well, my fellow SCOREcasters, I can't save you from Mr. Murphy, but I can tell you that by going through this exercise of building your template you&#8217;ll have a better understanding of how things are connected. You&#8217;ll have documentation and maybe even some type of drawing showing your connections. In the end, this should help you, if&#8230;.. sorry I meant when you need to troubleshoot your studio setup.<br />
<br />
Share with us tips on your templates.<br />
<br />
Until next time, happy composing.</div>

As always, this provocation isn't intended to be a statement of fact, or even to be taken literally&#8230; it's simply a way to get a fresh perspective on the topic. To <span style="font-style: italic;">provoke</span>, in other words. And I <span style="font-style: italic;">c</span><span style="font-style: italic;">an't wait</span> to hear what you think of this one.<br />
<div><br />
P<b>rovocation: Composers should have as little gear as possible.</b><br />
<br />
For any of us who have ever been bitten by the gear bug, this is straight-<span style="font-style: italic;">up heresy</span>! We <span style="font-style: italic;">need</span> that gear to be competitive. It provides us with inspiration, with new sonic possibilities. It's an indispensable part of our work flow and our creative process. So the more the better&#8230; right?<br />
<br />
On the other hand, having less gear might require us to use our creativity in a different way. Stripping down the studio might become its own sort of provocation&#8212;to delve a little deeper into the gear we <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> have.<br />
<br />
For many years, my Kurzweil K2000 was at the heart of my studio, and I used it pretty much as a controller. Not much else; just a way to get notes on the screen. Which is kind of a shame, really. That synth had (and still has!) deep processing power that I'll most likely never touch. Having less gear might oblige me to step outside my comfort zone.<br />
<br />
"Less gear" could also be taken in a less literal sense&#8212;consider the balance between electronic and live sound sources in your scores. What if you had to use <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> live players for a project&#8212;could you do it? I'm guessing you could. What if you couldn't even compose at the computer&#8230; what if you allowed yourself nothing but (the horror!) pencil and paper?<br />
<br />
I've tried it before&#8212;I spent several hours one sunny day on my balcony, armed only with a few score pages and a pencil. And a rapidly-shrinking eraser. It gave me a whole new appreciation for masters like Bernard Herrmann, who (so the legend goes) often wrote his sketches, <span style="font-style: italic;">in pen</span>, at the dinner table while surrounded by family.<br />
<br />
How else could you read this provocation? Where does it take you? Hop on those comments, people, and make some noise.</div></div>

I&#8217;ll be <span style="font-style: italic;">thinking out loud</span> about challenges as they hit.  I can&#8217;t say for sure I&#8217;ll arrive intact.   But if you&#8217;re a fellow traveler, we&#8217;ll confront the same demons.  May <span style="font-style: italic;">The Farce</span> be with us.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Who <span style="font-style: italic;">is </span>this <span style="font-style: italic;">Jim Well</span> guy?&#8221; you wonder.<br />
<br />
I didn&#8217;t start out to be a composer.  As a kid, I longed to be a music guy.  Dad said, &#8220;Son, be an <span style="font-style: italic;">engineer </span>instead.  Do music on the side.&#8221;  Taking his advice, I went to the Dark Side, while Muse took a nap.  Can&#8217;t say I regret my eons as an engineer.  It put serious bread on the table, rooted me in Northern California, gave me options.  I even liked it.<br />
<br />
But the life I <span style="font-style: italic;">didn&#8217;t</span> have wouldn&#8217;t die.  <span style="font-style: italic;">I had to get music back.</span>  So I got myself a keyboard. A wind controller.  Put up some music apps.  Started arranging, composing, sequencing, performing.  Found a ready audience near home.  Saw I was still the little engine that <span style="font-style: italic;">could</span>.  Only, it was just a <span style="font-style: italic;">hobby </span>&#8211; not enough.  Sound familiar?<br />
<br />
I cut the corporate cord in 2002.  Thought about Muse, but couldn&#8217;t find the road.  With other unmet needs in control, I zigged and zagged.  Tried being a nurse.  No.  Software entrepreneur.  No. Well, yes -- I <span style="font-style: italic;">did </span>want to be a businessman.   But Muse still hunted me.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_vV7U0jxn89Q/Si6tn2rQFmI/AAAAAAAAABo/lja8lcTE0Ew/s1600-h/Godzilla.png" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5345400707938784866" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_vV7U0jxn89Q/Si6tn2rQFmI/AAAAAAAAABo/lja8lcTE0Ew/s200/Godzilla.png" style="cursor: pointer; float: right; height: 152px; margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; width: 145px;" /></a><br />
Then, in 2007, three forces converged:  (1) I realized I had overlooked <span style="font-style: italic;">composing </span>as a way in; (2) <span style="font-style: italic;">virtual instrument technology</span> had come way farther than I ever thought; (3) I came to despise the <span style="font-style: italic;">Almighty Car</span>, and looked for a way to work without one, staying put.<br />
<br />
The <span style="font-style: italic;">... car</span>?<br />
<br />
Yeah.  When these three forces fermented with my entrepreneurial lust, it emerged that I would build a car-free, home-based, independent business around <span style="font-style: italic;">composing for media</span>, right here in Nor Cal, leveraging the Web. <span style="font-style: italic;"> That </span>has became my manifesto.  Maybe not so different from yours?<br />
<br />
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_vV7U0jxn89Q/Si6vYH0L84I/AAAAAAAAAB4/hltinOGOjL8/s1600-h/j0088456.png" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5345402636685013890" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_vV7U0jxn89Q/Si6vYH0L84I/AAAAAAAAAB4/hltinOGOjL8/s200/j0088456.png" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 155px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /></a><br />
"<span style="font-style: italic;">Not so fast</span>," a voice says.  "That&#8217;s not how the industry works.  There&#8217;s a long-established culture, a way of working.  Based on proximity, centered in LA and New York.  Besides, you gotta have <span style="font-style: italic;">chops</span>.  And if you wanna get into this business, you gotta come up the ladder like everybody else."<br />
<br />
You have just met Demon #1.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Do </span>pay attention ...<br />
<br />
I haven&#8217;t got all the answers, but I&#8217;m not moving from Nor Cal just yet.  One day, though, you <span style="font-style: italic;">might </span>see me apprenticed to an established composer, if I get the needed chops first.  No chops, no work.<br />
<br />
My first response to Demon #1 was like any chicken&#8217;s:  I looked to my strengths.   I knew I had to get to the School of Chops, but for me, <span style="font-style: italic;">getting </span>couldn&#8217;t mean <span style="font-style: italic;">going</span>.  I thought, what I <span style="font-style: italic;">have </span>is some cash, a technical background, and my so far hobby.  So I took what I knew and focused on creating a first-class <span style="font-style: italic;">project studio</span>.  With two goals:  become my classroom, <span style="font-style: italic;">and </span>be industry-ready.  Now I&#8217;ve built it ... and I&#8217;ve come.<br />

I&#8217;m sitting pretty and along comes Demon #2.  &#8220;You&#8217;re still just playing around,&#8221; it says.  &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">Toys </span>do not a composer make.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Holy cow.  You have actually be able to <span style="font-style: italic;">do </span>something that somebody needs.  Like, write really good music.  On a moment&#8217;s notice. <span style="font-style: italic;"> And</span>, you have to be able to <span style="font-style: italic;">show </span>that you can.  So now, it&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">all </span>about the School of Chops &#8211; and that demo reel.  Write, write, write.<br />
<br />

Demon #3:  &#8220;Too much to learn.  Without a mentor, you&#8217;ll tear yourself to bits!&#8221;<br />
<br />
Some truth here.  <span style="font-style: italic;"> Hafta </span>sharpen my focus.   What I <span style="font-style: italic;">most </span>want to do is write for full orchestra.  Make goose bumps.  The way I feel when I hear a good film score.  The closer I come to being &#8220;classically trained&#8221;, the better &#8211; as long as I can do it on my own, in the School of Chops.  Add that to the manifesto, please.<br />
<br />
Why <span style="font-style: italic;">classical</span>?  Listen to the Wagners, Stravinskys, Ravels, Coplands &#8230; <span style="font-style: italic;">doggoned </span>if they don&#8217;t sound like the scores I wanna write.  These guys were masters of how to get <span style="font-style: italic;">that sound</span>, wring that <span style="font-style: italic;">emotion </span>from the tools of the classical orchestra.  They left lots of scores to study.  And there&#8217;s no shortage of good books to guide the way.  Even some great online courses, like Peter Alexander&#8217;s <a href="http://www.truespec.com/-c-130_171.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Professional Orchestration</span></a>.  It boils down to <span style="font-style: italic;">discipline</span>.<br />
<br />

Demon #4 can&#8217;t stop laughing.  &#8220;Even <span style="font-style: italic;">if </span>you write it, who&#8217;s gonna <span style="font-style: italic;">play </span>it?&#8221;<br />
<br />
I&#8217;m from the Dark Side, I say.  You can&#8217;t stop <span style="font-style: italic;">me</span>.  But yes, good point.  First of all, MIDI will play a lot of what I write.  When that&#8217;s not good enough, the next step is that <span style="font-style: italic;">some </span>parts will be played by real musicians.  From <span style="font-style: italic;">where</span>, you ask?  Look, I know LA probably has the <span style="font-style: italic;">best </span>people to do this.  But I live in the Bay Area, near San Jose.  We have a lot of talent here, too.  I&#8217;ll draw on local resources whenever I can.  Why <span style="font-style: italic;">couldn&#8217;t </span>we do here &#8211; on a smaller scale &#8211; what LA&#8217;s done?  Time for some fresh thinking.<br />

<div id='summary4253363325432697789'><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SpFSTlrgcPI/AAAAAAAAAmE/1d6CV03s0cY/s1600-h/haynes-switchedon.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SpFSTlrgcPI/AAAAAAAAAmE/1d6CV03s0cY/s320/haynes-switchedon.png" border="0" /></a></div>It's been interesting to witness the progression of technology in both recording and electronic music over the past few decades. Years ago I worked on monstrous analog synthesizers - and like everyone else I've seen them shrink to computer-screen-sized virtual emulations. Just a few weeks ago I was touring a major scoring stage in town. They showed me the blank wall plate and large empty floor space in the control room where the multi-track recording units at one time dominated of the room. It was odd to see the outline of that portion of the floor where the big heavy recorders used to sit - it resembled a photo negative of a chalk outline for a dead (rectangular) body.<br /><br />Like so many others, I went from a room full of synthesizers, effects and recording gear to a single keyboard-based workstation with built-in sequencer and effects. I held out through the transition from analog to digital tape (at least in my own studio) and moved directly to computer-based recording. At that point, I was as eager as anyone to put everything "in the box". It seemed like desktop computing and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore's Law</a> was going to completely subsume the inherent limitations of hardware-specific processing. Of course there have been exceptions, from the continued development of dedicated hardware by a diminishing number of manufacturers - to the DSP-based add-on cards that support recording, effects and synthesis with the computer as the front-end. But, regardless of those stalwarts, the march toward software-based *everything* seemed inevitable.<br /><br />However, it's hasn't been all paradise in the land of the desktop. There are the always-looming hardware and software incompatibilities, not to mention the nearly-constant quest from more processing power. So many times those two factors are in a tug-of-war with each other - particularly with the current fits and starts toward native 64-bit computing. And from the manufacturers' perspectives, piracy has played a large part in their reticence to embrace the paradigm shift. In the midst of those contending factors there has been an interesting convergence - hardware seems to be making a kind of comeback. (and some would say *another* comeback) As it turns out, Moore's Law is a rising tide that lifts all ships - including specialized DSP processors. It has made it possible to put more power into specialized processors, and that in turn has allowed some hardware manufacturers to stake out new territory in the changing studio landscape. And several of those hardware-centric companies have been putting some effort into integrating their products into the computer-centered studio.<br /><br />For me, the migration back to hardware was nearly accidental. It started with my work on a new synthesizer from a company that started out as a plug-in designer. I helped to write the owner's manual for that synth, and between the massive amount of DSP power and front panel control plus the greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts architecture, I had to make it a permanent part of my studio. The next step on the slippery slope toward next-generation hardware was the change to a new audio interface on my main audio workstation. The device has a surprising amount of dedicated DSP on-board which can be used as a fully integrated plug-in in my sequencing environment. This one factor has caused me to go back and re-configure my scoring template - the built-in reverb on the audio interface is *that* good. And now I'm waiting on delivery of a new synthesizer that seamlessly integrates with the audio interface and sequencing environment to the point that it has all of the look and feel of a software-based plug-in. The beauty of it is that the one-hundred-plus voices and myriad effects are generated from a single-space rack mounted unit.<br /><br />It truly is the best of both worlds - but the irony is not lost on me. Even for orchestra-heavy cues, a substantial portion (and sometimes an outright majority) of sound in my studio is once again being generated by dedicated outboard hardware. Since I have found myself back in this position nearly by accident, it makes me wonder how and if other composers are re-discovering the potential advantage of dedicated hardware in their studio.<br /><br />________________<br /><span style="font-size:100%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">HOUSTON HAYNES</span></span><span style="font-size:100%;"> <span style="font-style: italic;">was born an raised in the southeastern United States, and moved to Los Angeles in 2003 to pursue a career as a composer</span><span style="font-style: italic;">. </span></span><span style="font-size:100%;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> You can find his SCORECast bio (and links to his other sites) <a href="2009/05/houston-haynes.html">here</a>.</span></span><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></div>

We&#8217;ll assume that if you&#8217;re building a beginning studio from scratch, you may not have too much money to put toward it at first. For that reason we&#8217;ll focus on low-cost solutions, suggestions, and tricks that work well, while also keeping an eye on the future to eventually extend your studio&#8217;s capabilities as your career progresses.<br />
<br />
In this first edition of THE DIY STUDIO, it seems appropriate to start with the ultimate basics of building a studio yourself, beginning with your studio&#8217;s nerve center: your computer. The question of Mac vs. PC in just about any computer-literate community is likely to produce some lively discussion- including among composers. Yes, perhaps the art of composing shouldn&#8217;t be sullied by such inelegant topics as technology; but the fact is, these days, most composers (especially composers for media) use computers heavily.<br />
<br />
So, which is it? Mac or PC? This question is at once practically unanswerable, yet also very simple to answer: It Depends.<br />
<br />
<br />
<h2>What are you starting with?</h2><br />
If you&#8217;re like me, you started out (or <strong>are</strong> starting out) with a home computer already. This might be just a regular machine you use for homework, email, surfing the web, gaming, etc. Generally speaking, a regular mid- to high- end desktop is a good starter system, although you may need to buy an external audio interface or sound card since many lower-end machines cannot support the audio processing horsepower you&#8217;re likely to need. (More on audio interfaces in a future DIY edition, but for now check out this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_card">Wikipedia article</a> on sound cards.) Gaming machines also tend to make great starter systems. If this is where you are and you don&#8217;t have a ton of money to spend, your Mac/PC decision may already be made for you, at least for now- it&#8217;s the system you currently own.<br />
<br />
But what if you have the luxury of picking a new system? For those of you a little further along in your career (and/or with better cash flow!), here are some considerations. Note that the below information is based on our observations here at SCOREcast, for your information. Sorry, you&#8217;ll still need to make your own decisions!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h2>Stuff to think about</h2><br />
<strong>Cost: </strong>All else being equal, PCs seem to deliver more to a beginner&#8217;s studio for the buck. It&#8217;s fairly easy to find a good &#8220;startup&#8221; studio PC for less than $1000, through any number of outlets. You can likewise find a Mac for less than $1000, but it may not provide comparable horsepower. You may also consider eBay, Craigslist, or other similar sites to find a good bargain, if you&#8217;re willing to risk purchasing a used system from a stranger.<br />
<br />
<strong>Features: </strong>At a hardware level, PCs and Macs actually have similar features, and it seems they are becoming increasingly similar. Do some comparison shopping between Apple and say, Dell or HP, and you&#8217;ll be able to configure nearly identical systems from a hardware standpoint, including processor, RAM, hard drive speed and size, and peripherals. One of the big differences is in software and drivers.<br />
<br />
<strong>Stability: </strong>Macs are famous for their stability, whether such fame is justifiable today or not. When PC users were still putzing around with Windows 3.1 trying to install peripherals, troubleshoot drivers, and figure out random crashes, Apple was developing solid drivers and Plug-and-Play. From this came the famous unofficial &#8220;trump card&#8221; mantra thrown into the faces of PC lovers by Mac proselytes: &#8220;It Just Works&#8221;. This mentality may still exist today, but to say that Apple&#8217;s operating systems are bulletproof, or that Windows is still a steaming pile, is simply inaccurate. From my own observation, it appears that the PC platform (with a Windows OS) is at least approaching the stability of the Mac. Of course you have other options, too. You could choose an alternative operating system on your PC (for example, <a href="http://ubuntustudio.org/home">Ubuntu Studio</a>, a free multimedia creation bundle of applications, is available for the Ubuntu Linux OS), but you may run into further compatibility, driver, and interoperability limitations.<br />
<br />
The fact is, no matter what platform you choose, your system will crash. And according to Murphy&#8217;s Law, it&#8217;s more likely to crash when you&#8217;re hip-deep in tons of great work you just finished, but have not yet saved. Choosing one platform over another does not preclude you from keeping backups and developing other good computing habits, no matter whether you go with Mac or PC.<br />
<br />
<strong>Software: </strong>The topic of software could easily be a column of its own. Pertinent to deciding on Mac or PC though, I&#8217;ll keep it short. Both PCs and Macs run tons of music production software. In fact, many vendors now write their software to work on either Mac or PC, or at least provide both installations on the same media. Be aware though that there are some notable titles that are Mac-only, such as Digital Performer, Logic, and Garageband.<br />
<br />
<strong>Internet Access / Viruses: </strong>A couple weeks ago I posted a &#8220;Mac or PC&#8221; discussion topic on the SCOREcast Facebook page. In the discussion, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Sergio-Mendoza-Hochmann/55050982059?ref=nf">Sergio Mendoza Hochmann</a> made a great point in favor of Macs regarding viruses. It&#8217;s true: at this time, most viruses target Windows. Whether this is because virus writers hate Windows more than they hate Mac or whether it&#8217;s because Windows has a larger userbase is not germane to this article, so I&#8217;ll leave that topic alone. But the fact remains: there are more Windows viruses than Mac OS viruses. So another question to ask yourself is whether you can afford to keep your PC studio machine off the Internet, installing stuff &#8220;old school&#8221;, or whether you can afford the CPU horsepower to run antivirus software. Although, with the sophisticated licensing and other anti-piracy measures put in place now by so many music production software vendors, I don&#8217;t know how practical it is to keep your studio machine off the network. Mac OS users don&#8217;t face this problem to the extent that users of Windows do&#8230; as much&#8230; at this time.<br />
<br />
<strong>Interoperability: </strong>One of the areas where your platform choice is important is whether your system and the stuff you run on it will allow you to work well with other people, and their systems. For this reason, Mac may edge out PC as there is virtually no PC-only music production software, while there are a handful of significant Mac-only software titles. Usually there are workarounds (for example, exporting tracks to .wav format and importing them elsewhere), and you may have to deal with interoperability issues as you start out. Eventually though, you&#8217;ll want to minimize these issues to speed your workflow (and the workflow of those that are paying you!)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h2>Final Thought</h2><br />
Buying your first studio system is a big step, and an important one. Make sure to ask people what they use and why (SCOREcast is a great resource for this); elicit opinions, and you&#8217;ll get plenty of feedback. Both sides of the PC / Mac argument may say that their platform is best: they&#8217;re both right. It is best- for them. You have to decide what is best <em>for you</em>. Once you make your decision and get your system, just make it work, and learn from your own wins and mistakes to be even better informed when you move on to your next system.</div>

I don't know how I got it, except to say that lately I've been running pretty hard on very little rest, and so I think it was just my turn.<br /><br />When you're sick you can't do much, which is a real pain in the ass for guys like me who hard time sitting still for five minutes. I'm pretty sure it's God's way of telling me that I need to take a break. Today, I got that chance, and it provided me with an opportunity to share something with all of you that I thought was pretty cool.<br /><br />In one of my many neglected industry mags that I've let stack up by the front door over the last several weeks, I read an interview with James Cameron about his forthcoming highly anticipated film "Avatar". He doesn't spill any beans about the movie for u<span style="font-style: italic;">s </span>Sci-Fi geeks that have been waiting for a good four years, but he says some pretty cool things in the interview about his film making process.<br /><br />After a bunch of stuff about how Cameron got into movies, what it was like working for Roger Corman, and how he talked the studio into letting him finish "Titanic", the interviewer asked him, "Why do you think you've been so lucky as a filmmaker?"<br /><br />Cameron gave this as his answer:<br /><br /><blockquote style="font-style: italic;">"Luck? Look, when I was 10 years old, I knew I wanted to do this for a living. When I started in Hollywood, yes, I got some breaks, but those breaks were opportunities born out of sheer preparedness and hand-to-the-plow work ethic. I've had some crazy ideas, and thanks to those ideas everything I've ever accomplished has come about because I literally talked the decision-makers into liking my idea. Nobody has ever wanted to <span>give</span> me anything until I convinced them to. If you want to succeed in this industry, or any industry for that matter, you have to work like you have no other choice but to succeed. Luck has nothing to do with it."</blockquote><br />Some people might read Cameron's words and dismiss them as more rhetoric from someone already accused on several occasions of being an egomaniac. But when I read this, I smiled.<br /><br />He's right. I don't believe in the concept of a "self-made" man - everyone has had help at one point or another. However, there is a notion Cameron is speaking about here that I've heard before and completely agree with: Opportunities are not given, they are <span style="font-style: italic;">taken</span>. When someone gives you a shot at something, the execution of the opportunity lives or dies with <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">you</span>. If you don't have the skills to pay the bills, what good is an opportunity from someone in the first place?<br /><br />The first job I had in the industry writing original music was for Monday Night Football at ABC Sports. I was scared out of my mind, and my first couple of weeks on the show consisted of days of pure joy punctuated by moments of sheer terror. In my heart I knew I could do it, but my head daily told me otherwise. I made a lot of mistakes working on that show, but I learned from them quickly. In hindsight, however, I would have made many greater mistakes had I not prepared myself for the day when someone said, "You're up, kiddo!"<br /><br />Before Monday Night Football, I had zero experience with television schedules, broadcasting formats, and delivery specifications. But what I <span style="font-style: italic;">did</span> have were the scoring chops and production skills necessary to sustain writing 41 minutes of music every week for four months straight with no break in the schedule. Those skills did not come about through osmosis; they came about through years of musically training myself like a marathon runner so that when it came time for me to take the baton I could hit the ground running and never look back. In my experience, the anticipation of opportunity plus preparation, knowledge, and a certain amount of wild-eyed craziness was the recipe for success.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">You</span> are the only one who can guarantee your own success at this. With preparation and work ethic you will make it in this business. But it's all on <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">you</span>. <span style="font-style: italic;">Luck</span> has nothing to do with it.</div>

Each month we'll explore various functions behind the use of music in film and continually pose the questions...<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Why is music used here?</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">What is its function?<br />
</span><br />
Before diving headlong into an analytical frenzy surrounding the functions of film music, I want to begin by establishing a frame of reference by which the very existence of film music centers. In doing that one must not immediately look at specific moments in film that are supported by music but rather moments which are not.<br />
<br />
Silence (or non-scored scenes) in film is a beautiful thing. I have a knack for confusing people by saying that even as a film composer, there is nothing I love more than film that works perfectly without music. There's an ingrained sense of cinematic perfection when it achieves its narrative goals without the aid of music. These moments contain something that music could never offer...complete and total silence (by that I'm still acknowledging the existence of dialogue and sound effects).<br />
<br />
If we are to believe that music is an ingredient that when added to a particular scene helps achieve a variety of narrative goals then one might reasonably deduce that perhaps that scene is flawed in some way. Is this true? If the scene needs help by employing music does that make it an inferior scene to one that is successful wholly on its own?<br />
<br />
These are rhetorical questions that don't necessarily need answering. Because of the extreme variation in cinematic storytelling and the many obstacles contained therein there is no definitive answer. However, I pose the question merely to get your brain tuned to the frequency of judging silence vs. scoring.<br />
<br />
I think the art of spotting a film (deciding where music should go in a movie) is dying. Gone are the days where I'm noticing clever choices in spotting which used to be frequently exhibited by composers like Bernard Herrmann, Miklós Rózsa, and perhaps the best spotter of them all...Jerry Goldsmith. Their creative decisions on where to put music (or more importantly, where <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> to put music) vastly effected the overall success and quality of their scores and ultimately their respective films.<br />
<br />
For example, let's look at a classic scene in NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959) directed by Alfred Hitchcock. There is a moment where Roger Thornhill (played by Cary Grant) ascends upon a lone crossroads in the middle of nowhere to await instruction from his unknown mystery source. He stands there patiently...waiting. The scene is unusually long and not much, if anything, really happens. A car drives by, a man appears and waits, a bus passes...all benign, boring, and without a clue of justification.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_6sJwCvpA_rI/SihJHpvP4TI/AAAAAAAAACY/DWb8c1N2Unk/s1600-h/north_by_northwest.png" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5343601353687032114" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_6sJwCvpA_rI/SihJHpvP4TI/AAAAAAAAACY/DWb8c1N2Unk/s400/north_by_northwest.png" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 227px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 400px;" /></a><br />
<br />
So how does the master, Bernard Herrmann, decide to score benign and boring?<br />
<br />
He doesn't. The scene, in its entirety, is left completely unscored. Why? Isn't Herrmann worried about losing at least part of the audience here? It's a valid concern.<br />
<br />
This entire scene is about perpetuating one question...<span style="font-style: italic;">What the hell is going on?</span> Roger is internally asking it to himself. We, as the audience, are asking this of ourselves as we experience this along with him. It's the "elephant-in-the-room" of this scene.<br />
<br />
There isn't a note of music Herrmann could have written that could better express the awkwardness of the moment better than silence. It's the inherent function of silence that works so utterly beautifully here.<br />
<br />
Moments later the scene is thrust into overdrive as Roger is peculiarly attacked by a nearby crop-dusting biplane. Again the question accelerates and perpetuates..."What the hell is going on?" It isn't until the scene is completely over and the crop duster plows into the side of a tanker truck that Herrmann finally enters the music.<br />
<br />
As many times as I've seen this scene, I often wonder if it were made today how many composers would automatically score this scene. I think a high percentage of them probably would. It's a powerful lesson more composers should heed.<br />
<br />
Silence is a powerful thing...and as an added benefit, it's far less work.</div>

Remember, the provocation is a statement that, on its face, seems nonsensical or just plain wrong&#8230; but we're going to use it as a "think tool" to get some perspective.<br />
<br />
Please jump in with your thoughts and comments&#8230; that's what this is all about!<br />
<br />
Provocation:&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Directors should use a different composer for each film they make.</span><br />
<b><br />
</b><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">OK, this one hits close to home. I applaud loyalty in this crazy Industry&#8230; even when it costs me the gig. I think the creative shorthand a collaborative team can achieve is incredibly valuable, and many of my favorite films (and scores) are born of long-standing partnerships between filmmaker and composer.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I can't imagine a Steven Spielberg picture, to take the most obvious example, without a John Williams score. And my favorite Alfred Hitchcock films are the ones in which Bernard Herrmann's music amps up the suspense till I <span style="font-style: italic;">just can't stand it anymore</span>.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">On the other hand&#8230;</span>&nbsp;This provocation reminds me that (in keeping with this month's theme of <span style="font-style: italic;">diversity)&nbsp;</span>we must approach each new project with a perspective that's unique to the story we're trying to tell together. <span style="font-style: italic;">As if </span>we're a different composer. Even if it's with a director with whom we've collaborated often and successfully.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Another pathway this provocation suggests has to do with <span style="font-style: italic;">staleness</span>. I have my favorite sounds all loaded comfortably into my writing template, but recently I've been working on a project that has required me to strip those away and use all-new sounds. It's <span style="font-style: italic;">astounding</span>&nbsp;how tough that's been. And how refreshing. A director might come to feel the same way (in this comparison, you and I equate to those familiar sounds in the template&#8212;!).</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Let me know what this provocation brings to mind for you. Take it literally if you like&#8212;after all, for many directors (Oliver Stone comes to mind) it's their standard operating procedure. Or just follow whatever seems interesting about it. The point of these provocations is to suggest new angles for tackling old problems&#8230; to lead us away from the familiar.</span></span></div>

I am still a university student, and therefore am learning the essentials, but the real valuable lessons I have learned about this business have not been from lectures and exercises in harmonic theory. The most important things I&#8217;ve learned about building and maintaining a career as a film composer have come from two things: Watching my boss balance his personal and professional life, and looking into the eyes of my 9-month-old daughter every night when I get home from the studio or from a long day of classes. You see, my equation for success in all of this looks something like this: Experience + Values = Success. We&#8217;ll see if my foresight pays off. Call me in 20 years.<br />
<br />
There was a time when I thought my boss (Deane) was an idiot (sorry dude! ;-) because he regularly schedules time to be with his family. I used to think to myself, &#8220;How can he expect to maintain his success if he constantly gives up time in the studio to hang out at the beach?&#8221; But then, after months of observing how he spends that time in the studio, I began to understand that he doesn&#8217;t &#8220;give up&#8221; anything to the benefit of anything else. Instead, he carefully plans out each hour of the day so that he can be home when he needs to be home and at work when he needs to be at work. For him, no moments in the studio are wasted. Everything has a purpose and a reason, the ultimate goal being balance and harmony between home life and work life.<br />
<br />
In my former life as a &#8220;Remote Controlian&#8221;, this was a foreign concept to me. At that job, the success equation looked a little different. It was more like Time at RC - Your Life = Success. For a lot of us, this is how we are used to working &#8211; abandoning every other aspect of our lives in favor of the studio&#8217;s demands. In some cases, this cannot be helped, and I&#8217;ve learned that working with Deane as well. Best intentions be damned, deadline week is always deadline week, and you might as well face that you are going to be there late into the night &#8211; possibly overnight &#8211; and sometimes on multiple nights. But it *is* possible to carefully map out your time so that you allow for every part of your life to have a rightful place.<br />
<br />
Here are five things we do at Deane&#8217;s studio to help us get home to what matters most and keep our significant others from setting our laptops on fire.<br />
<br />
<ol><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Do the tough stuff first.</span> When I get to work, I have a list of stuff I need to get done for the entire week. Sometimes it is prioritized, and sometimes it is not. Some things are simple projects that I know will take me an hour to accomplish, while others are long term projects that are going to take months. No matter what, I first select the things I&#8217;m not looking forward to but are short term projects and I do them first. Doing this allows me to knock out half the list in the first day or two of the week, which is a great feeling, and gives me an early sense of accomplishment before the crush of the week kicks in.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Engage &#8220;Cloak Mode&#8221; when necessary.</span> Ever since being tasked with getting SCOREcastOnline.com up and running, I&#8217;ve taken this method from Deane and made it my own. Deane will sometimes say to me, &#8220;Okay dude, I&#8217;m going into &#8220;Cloak Mode&#8221;. This basically means that he is not going to answer calls, emails, or questions from anyone unless someone has been shot or killed, and even then, he&#8217;ll think about it. &#8220;Cloak Mode&#8221; drives his manager crazy and makes people mad sometimes, but if he *told* everyone to leave him alone for 7 hours, they simply wouldn&#8217;t. People are like little kids - when you tell them NOT to do something, it makes them want to do it even more. For Deane, only Susie and the director/producers of our current film are the kryptonite for &#8220;Cloak Mode&#8221;. For me, it&#8217;s Deane or my wife. Everyone else has to wait.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remove all distractions from your workspace.</span> If you do not want to be a slave to your studio, then you really need to do this. At Deane&#8217;s we have the &#8220;List&#8221;. The List contains things that are available to do, but completely non-beneficial to our work at the studio. Some of the goofy ones are things like &#8220;checking your Facebook&#8221; or &#8220;playing Warcraft&#8221;. But we also say that &#8220;getting involved in other people&#8217;s crises&#8221; is a List item and can be a huge time-sucking distraction from work. So are &#8220;emails that take longer than 5 minutes to write&#8221;. If they do, they are considered a distraction, and you should probably just pick up the phone and make the call. It&#8217;s quicker and it leaves less room for confusion anyhow.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Learn and live the Covey Quadrant System.</span><br />
I&#8217;d never heard of this system before I worked at Deane&#8217;s studio, but it kicks all kinds of ass. Basical<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fZp_xxfyktg/SiZD08HE_ZI/AAAAAAAAABI/WNiO81TsnmM/s1600-h/covey-quadrants.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5343032584689745298" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fZp_xxfyktg/SiZD08HE_ZI/AAAAAAAAABI/WNiO81TsnmM/s320/covey-quadrants.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 188px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 188px;" /></a>ly, it starts with the basic understanding that you can categorize everything that happens in a work day into one of four quadrants: Things that are important and urgent (Q1); important but not urgent (Q2); urgent but not important (Q3); and finally, not urgent and not important (Q4). Q4 items can just immediately be thrown away - stuff like junk mail, spam, and stuff you absolutely hate doing and don&#8217;t have to (like mowing the lawn - just hire a gardener!). Q1 items are things that are life and death issues and must be dealt with immediately (your spouse gets in a car wreck, picture edits while on the scoring stage). Q3 items are things that are crises for others, but not necessarily for you (&#8220;tech&#8217;ing&#8221; someone over the phone on computer stuff - this happens to me almost daily!). And Q2 is where you want to try and spend the majority of your time. Learn this system, memorize it, and most importantly, use it. It will change your life and save you hours upon hours of precious time.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Get to bed early and get up to go to work earlier.</span> I know... this sounds sacrilegious to most of you studio rats, but trust me, it is better for you. Your mind will work faster for it and you&#8217;ll get more done working in the first part of the day than you will the last part. The argument against this principle always goes something like this: &#8220;I can&#8217;t get up early. I&#8217;m just not a morning person.&#8221; I bet if there was an earthquake at 3am, you&#8217;d be up and out of bed with no hesitation, coherent and soberingly aware of what needed to be done. That is because it is important to you. Therefore, if you wanted to, you could get out of bed at 4am rather than getting into bed at 4am. Most doctors will tell you that if you miss out on the sleep hours of 12am-3am, you might as well just stay up all night. Those are the average critical deep sleep pattern windows for the human body. If you are staying up until the wee hours of the night and then sleeping until late morning, you are fooling yourself into thinking that you are being the most productive. Try it. You&#8217;ll thank me later.</li>
</ol><br />
There are hundreds of other ways I could mention that will help you live a more balanced life between studio and home. The honest truth is that it all simply comes down to choices. Do you want it, or do you not? You have to decide that for yourself. The bottom line is that there are about 14 healthy work hours in every single day. Are you *really* redeeming every single minute of every hour that you have been given?<br />

<br />
Some directors know exactly what they want, others will define what works as a process of musical evolution. For me, discovering the director&#8217;s sensibilities is a top priority. By &#8216;sensibilities&#8217; I do mean mind reading. How do you talk music when words can&#8217;t express the colors, emotions, and pulse? Yeah, I know you can discuss music academically, but guess what? It doesn&#8217;t work. No matter how articulate you might be, a director has a vision which is usually satisfied with music, not words. Keep in mind I am referring mostly to the temp music process where I follow the rule which says &#8220;show don&#8217;t tell&#8221;.  The following is a compilation of sensibility scenarios, some recent, some not.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;m including this first scenario to contradict myself and illustrate how many variations there are to the collaborative effort. I was in a spotting session with the brilliant and talented <a href="http://www.cliffeidelman.com/">Cliff Eidelman</a>. The director was running out of words to express himself and the room-tension was building. Cliff sweetly diffused him, &#8220;If you just attach a color to it, red, blue and so on.&#8221;  Cliff simplified what could have been a very exasperating session and he delivered a most beautiful score. I don&#8217;t recommend anyone but Cliff offering up magic markers and paper unless, like Cliff, you have the chops and the charm to back it up.<br />
<br />
A horrible thing happened to an A-list composer on a very good film. The very high profile director, for almost legitimate reasons, let his picture editor translate his musical vision for him. It didn&#8217;t take long until the composer got fired because communication was filtered through the film editor. Sadly, that composer could have done a spectacular job as he&#8217;d done on the previous film which included an Oscar nomination for his score. I still feel for him - that kind of wound can&#8217;t heal easily. All composers get fired, but that was a tragic error in mis-communication.<br />
<br />
For everyone&#8217;s good -  if you find yourself in the middle, try to extract yourself. It&#8217;s inevitable and part of your job that you pass on minor notes, but always try to keep the composer and director in their own creative loop. Often a director will say, &#8220;Make sure they don&#8217;t use the zither in this scene.&#8221; I immediately send an email and dictate the words aloud as I write. This usually circumnavigates my getting in the middle because the director will want to edit the email.<br />
<br />
Sometimes you&#8217;ll be so right for a film that your taste will match the director&#8217;s sensibilities and the job is pure joy. These directors tend to surround themselves with the same crew on every film. I&#8217;ve worked with Rob Reiner long enough that we are family. Rob knows what he wants inside of the first three notes. I call my Reiner gigs comfort food, but I never take them for granted.<br />
<br />
The next scenario is a director who is open to all your crazy ideas, but you haven&#8217;t quite nailed what he&#8217;s looking for. I highly recommend the crazy idea approach so long as you have some slightly more conservative options. You always want to think and keep thinking out of the box. I apologize for that phrase, but keeping the creativity flowing is one of the keys to the collaborative effort. When you are in that flow you will notice your physical energy is higher as well. Creative flow is what life is all about.<br />
<br />
The worst case is when you will never get into the director&#8217;s head, and before you make yourself crazy trying, let me offer this-- don&#8217;t. You will never figure this director out because they don&#8217;t want you to. What they want is to keep you off balance. It&#8217;s human nature to desire to please, but you&#8217;ll drive yourself to cigarettes and whiskey doing so. This is the toughest job you&#8217;ll find. It&#8217;s also the gig with the highest turnover rate, and the highest pay.<br />
<br />
A few of these directors seem to make all members of the music department moving targets. Just when you think you&#8217;ve discovered exactly what they want, they change their mind the next day. They have every right to do so, but you bang your head against the wall because your comfort level just got shot, again. Don&#8217;t take it personal. Be willing to bend like a pretzel, eventually time will be on your side and they will have to make a decision. Until that decision is made there&#8217;s an extreme amount of tension that can include temper tantrums and humiliation, the former theirs, the latter yours. How to react positively, or just survive, takes years of practice and I&#8217;ve never found that it gets easier. Often these directors go through high profile music editors quicker than Dr House does vicodin. It&#8217;s worth repeating: Don&#8217;t take it personal.<br />
<br />
Face-time with your director is the key to mind reading. If you aren&#8217;t sitting together and playing music you&#8217;re headed for trouble. If possible have a few options, or at least one alternate. I was on a film where the director demanded three options to every cue. Options can confuse you, but try to roll with them. I don&#8217;t like them either, but if the director doesn&#8217;t love your one opus you&#8217;re left holding an empty bag. On the other hand I&#8217;ve been so excited with one discovery I will risk playing it without backup. The higher your sensibility radar the less options you need.<br />
<br />
Always trust the director&#8217;s vision no matter how crazy it seems. You&#8217;d be surprised at their process and how the music can all come beautifully together. Finally, be willing to let your brilliant ideas go, or have the director take credit for them. It&#8217;s the Hollywood way.<br />

But, I have a legitimate excuse, which I am going to use to kick off my first post here in my series &#8220;Composer as Producer.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Before I get started, I&#8217;ll take a quick moment to explain the purpose of my column.  As a lecturer at UCLA, my personal goal is to train students in the skills they need to bring their music from the initial moment of creativity to the finished product, whether it be a live performance, an electronic recording, or a combination of the two.<br />
<br />
Even as the prices of music production equipment continue to fall, and the opportunities for live performances and funding continue to disappear, most schools continue to train composers in the same ways they have for years, falling short of giving composer the essential tools to actually deliver their music to an audience.  The purpose of this column is to help fill in the gap between traditional music training (creativity and technique) and the elusive process of creating a tangible musical product that can be sold, broadcasted, and promoted (making a living).<br />
<br />
So back to my excuse and the impetus for this first column.  Yesterday I was called to orchestrate and conduct a short recording session that had an 11am downbeat&#8230; today. Without the techniques I speak about below, the answer could not have been &#8216;Yes.&#8217;<br />
<br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">TEMPLATES</span><br />
<div class="MsoNormal"> Templates are a key to beginning your projects off on the right foot.  When orchestrating and preparing parts, use a Sibelius or Finale template with objects that are unique to film music already set- boxed bar numbers in the correct places; both violin lines in the same part; a line dedicated to notating pre-recorded material; correct spacing, etc.  Objects which may not appear in an ideal place when starting from scratch (copyright text, composer text, page numbers, et al.) should be moved to the correct position in both the score and parts.  Formatting the parts in this template (spacing, bar number location, placement of text) is key. Furthermore, upon starting a new project, copy and modify the basic template to fit the unique instrumentation as well as any special needs of the particular session and its musicians.  A reasonable estimate of time save is about 20-40 minutes of detailed editing saved <i>per score</i>.</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">Perhaps even more useful are templates in sequencing programs.  When using external computers hosting sounds, this standard technique saves us from setting complex MIDI and audio routings within each new session (sometimes for over 150 tracks in modern film composer studios).  But there are a handful of other ways to save yourself time and effort when beginning a sequence and setting up your tracks.</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">For Logic users, an entire chain of plugins can be saved as a &#8216;Channel Strip,&#8217; a small file which preserves the settings of every single plugin loaded on a channel, from samplers to compressors to reverbs.  This feature is accessed above the EQ window on any channel in the Logic mixer.  Once you have created a useful sound that you will want to recall elsewhere in your project or at any point in the future.  These files can then be copied to other computers (Users / Home Folder / Library / Application Support / Logic / Channel Strip Settings) and as of Logic 8, can be shared using Apple&#8217;s Me service.</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">Unique to Digital Performer are V-Racks, short for &#8220;Virtual Racks.&#8221;  Several plugins can be put into a V-Rack and saved.  These virtual racks are maintained when switching sequences in Digital Performer&#8217;s chunks feature, saving what can be upwards of 5 minutes in plugin and sample loading time when switching cues.</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">Digital Performer, Cubase, and ProTools can also save settings using the plugin&#8217;s dedicated save features or the host application&#8217;s own plugin saving function.  However, large and complex plugins may not be able to save in the host application&#8217;s own plugin interface.  These files may be limited in size and unable to save each parameter or these extensive plugins (this is currently and issue with Digital Performer and Omnisphere; use Omisphere&#8217;s own save function to overcome this).</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">These programs allow you to save templates within their own interface, and Logic 8 and Pro Tools 8 both come with pre-made templates including plugins set up by professional engineers.  Plugins such as Kontakt and Stylus RMX allow the saving of multiple channels of instruments and their settings into a single &#8216;Multi&#8217; file.</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">ADVANCED TRICK: Do you like the idea or channel strips but you don&#8217;t use Logic?  Try Plogue Bidule.  Known as an efficient and stable AU and VST host that can run in both standalone and Rewire, Plogue Bidule comes in a plugin form as well.  Inserted as a virtual instrument in your sequencer, you can create a chain of effects and plugins within the interface of the plugin and save this setting for future use.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><i><br />
</i></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">KEY COMMANDS</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"> The more time your hand spends moving a mouse around the more time you are going to spend focusing on the screen, navigating through deep menus, and in general, being distracted from writing.  Rather than searching for a task that is located 3 menus deep within a certain editor window, most tasks have been assigned a key or set of keys on the QWERTY keyboard that take a fraction of the second to complete</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">Tasks that have not been assigned key commands can be created by the use in programs such as Logic and Digital Performer, while the initial set can also be edited to taste.</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">The goal any composer has is to write good music with minimal distraction and strain.  Being able to quickly make changes to the material in your sequencer, notation editor, or any other computer program will help break down the &#8216;virtual wall&#8217; between your creativity and the execution of it using a digital medium.  Learn how to minimize your time on the mouse by with key commands- learn them as you go along, and the more you work, key commands will gradually become part of your process.  I don't even think about key commands anymore- they have become second nature.  The result is a fluid interface between creativity and the programs used to solidify it.</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">ALSO: For Logic users, a key command that is often overlooked is &#8216;Capture Last Take as Recording.&#8221;  As your are playing your sequence, the computer is listening to and remember every note you play between the time you hit play and the time you hit stop.  Using this key command can take that improvisation that turned out to be quite good into an midi region- exactly how you played it!  I never hit record any more&#8230;</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><i><br />
</i></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">FILE ORGANIZATION</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"> Keeping files organized and safe on your computer will be the last topic of today&#8217;s post.  This seemingly boring issue will not seem so boring the day your hard drive fails; or after you waste several hours trying to figure out which file is the one the studio loved; or rewriting a main title cue after accidentally erasing the original.</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">First things first- create a single master folder for the project where every file associated with the project will live.  Subfolders can be made within that- Sequences, Rough Mixes, Documents, Videos, etc.  Back up this folder using one of any number of fine products - SuperDuper, CarbonCopyCloner, SynchronizeX, Time Machine, Retrospect.  In fact, if the project is currently underway, back it up to two places.  And update the backups twice per day at least!</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">This system also makes transferring the entire project between systems very simple.  When moving between your desktop and laptop, rather than gathering files together from all across your system, you can just copy the master folder over to your laptop drive get started.</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">One common file organization technique is to use a 2 to 3 letter abbreviation for a project at the beginning of each file associated with it.  For instance, if I was scoring a show named &#8216;Donald the Duck,&#8217; each sequence, audio mix, or document associated with the show would begin with the abbreviation &#8216;DD.&#8217;  Also, rather than using spaces, which may cause errors on PCs as well as when exchanging files on the internet, many will use underscores instead of spaces.  So if I wrote a cue called &#8216;River Chase&#8217; for this show, my file would be called &#8216;DD_1m1_RiverChase.&#8217;</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">After that name, a version number will be placed so that changes can be tracked easily.  Say I have written &#8216;DD_1m1_RiverChase_v1&#8217; and the producer has requested some revisions.  Rather than going into version 1 and editing that, I will duplicate the file and rename it &#8216;DD_1m1_RiverChase_v2,&#8217; preserving my original version in case it is needed later in the process.  Depending on the process, even a sub-version may be used for smaller changes, i.e. &#8216;DD_1m1_RiverChase_v2-1&#8217; or &#8216;DD_1m1_RiverChase_v2b.&#8217;</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">Timecode can be placed in filenames as well.  Rather than using colons or periods usually associated with timecode, dashes will translate much better when passing files to different people and systems.  Usually the hour is dropped because this is indicated by the first digit of the cue number (&#8216;1m1&#8217; in the title above would translate to &#8216;Hour 1, Music Cue 1.&#8217;  Similarly, music cue 2 in hour 3 will be designated &#8216;3m2.&#8217;)</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">Perhaps the final mix file of this cue will look like this: &#8216;DD_1m1_RiverChase_v3_03-31-15.&#8217;  That timecode at the end would translate to 3 minutes, 31 seconds, and 15 frames.</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">Dates can also be used.  To differentiate between dates and timecode, most often the punctuation of dates is removed so that today, June 1<sup>st</sup> 2009 would become 060109.</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">NEXT TIME: WHY EVERY COMPOSER SHOULD OWN AN ANALOG SYNTH</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></div></div>

I set my own hours (which are often brutal&#8212;!), and that means I can eat when I want&#8230; go shopping when I want&#8230; sleep when I want.</div><div>To me, that's liberating. But it's also dangerous&#8212;right? It requires a kind of discipline. Every moment we dedicate to this career is a conscious choice. Sometimes it's tough to stick by that choice, especially in the face of legitimate priorities like family and finances.</div><div>So it's a two-part question today: 1) do you try to make your music schedule fit in with the rest of the working world&#8212;i.e., are you a 9-5 Monday-Friday composer? and 2) Do you think this aspect of our career is an advantage, a disadvantage, or simply a fact of life?</div><div>Take a couple of minutes, if your schedule will allow it, and let me know what you think.</div></div>
