Their ground-breaking EastWest Quantum Leap Symphony Orchestra was one of the first full-fledged orchestral sample libraries to be developed and still is one of the best entry-level libraries around.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Since then, EastWest has continued to constantly innovate by presenting top-quality indispensable tools, spanning a large variety of styles. In 2015, EastWest introduced Composer Cloud and became the first sample library developer to offer a subscription plan for a sample-based product. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While this new model was initially met with mixed responses across the composer community, more and more composers are signing up. So let\u2019s take a look at what the Composer Cloud is and how it can enhance your daily work.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h2>General Overview<\/h2>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>HOW IT WORKS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The concept is rather simple really. All you need to do is download the EW Installation center from the Support section of the website. This requires you to sign into your personal EW account and as soon as the Installation Center is installed on your computer, all your previous purchases (before the introduction of the subscription model) and your current subscription are automatically reflected. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Installation Center conveniently manages everything pertaining to your EW libraries. It allows you to download, <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-2292\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Capture1-389x567.png\" alt=\"Capture1\" width=\"206\" height=\"335\" \/>install, and activate any library you wish, it displays any updates available for your current EW software and it also allows you to relocate libraries should you choose to migrate them to another disk. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A very pleasant surprise was the download speeds. Downloading almost all of the EW libraries took me just a few hours on a 50bpm DSL connection and the entire process was rather painless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>THE SUBSCRIPTION PLANS<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The introduction of Composer Cloud essentially gives a subscriber access to over 10,000 instruments for a yearly or monthly fee. All Composer cloud subscriptions include the entire EW catalog of libraries and the only difference is the different microphone positions included. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The subscription model comes in 3 different versions : <em>Composer Cloud<\/em>, <em>Composer Cloud <\/em>X, and <em>Composer Cloud Plus<\/em>:<\/span><\/p>\n<table style=\"height: 462px;\" width=\"838\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\"><\/td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;

I must admit that I have had my fair share of troubles with the PLAY engine, but not so many that would stop me from enjoying the vast array of sound colors at my fingertips. PLAY is updated rather regularly and the EW support team is incredibly responsive and accommodating. Mr. Joey Medina was particularly helpful in setting me up and patiently answering any my questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 4\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h2>Performance<\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 5\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I took three months to test the basic Composer Cloud subscription in several different projects, including ones where time was absolutely of the essence. Although I am not using any SSDs for streaming my samples (just plain old 7200rpm drives), aside from a slightly increased loading time, everything worked well and the system was rather stable. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Not having used any Hollywood products before I was very impressed by the very expressive quality of many of the instruments, especially the legato ones. Aside from all the very well-known libraries, all subscriptions include some lesser-known older libraries such as \u201c56\u2019 Stratocaster\u201d, \u201cFunky Ass Loops\u201d, \u201cScoring Tools\u201d and I was able to discover many hidden gems in there that are still extremely useful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2294\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/CC_3-389x257.png\" alt=\"CC_3\" width=\"389\" height=\"257\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/CC_3-389x257.png 389w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/CC_3-768x508.png 768w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/CC_3-640x424.png 640w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/CC_3-300x199.png 300w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/CC_3.png 1804w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2293\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/CC_2-389x257.png\" alt=\"CC_2\" width=\"389\" height=\"257\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/CC_2-389x257.png 389w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/CC_2-768x508.png 768w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/CC_2-640x423.png 640w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/CC_2-300x198.png 300w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/CC_2.png 1772w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Final Observations<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I can\u2019t say that I will be using all 10,000 instruments in my work regularly but in my opinion, the Composer Cloud is definitely worth its money, especially now that they have introduced a month-to-month subscription. I think of it this way: very often we part with $300-$400 for a library which sounds amazing only to later find out that we can use maybe half of the patches as we imagined we would and the rest fall into obscurity. Well, spending the same amount of money for access to 10,000 instruments for an entire year (even if hypothetically we only used 5,000 of these) makes sense in my mind. Besides, new libraries are coming out every month and many sample libraries become obsolete after a few years (simply because realism is always taken to new levels with each new stride in technology). Instead of spending money on one library in perpetuity &#8211; which could become obsolete after a few years &#8211; I\u2019d rather spend the same amount of money to \u2018borrow\u2019 53+ of them for a year. This becomes relatively obvious when you consider that your needs often change as a composer. Your sampling arsenal could change drastically within a year just based on trends and musical tastes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The EastWest Composer Cloud is a terrific solution for anyone looking to expand or cultivate a wide palette with just one purchase. As long as EastWest continues to innovate in the sampling market by adding products to their CC lineup over time, subscribing to this service could be a very wise move for anyone looking for the highest quality in sampled sounds.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>COMPOSER CLOUD<\/strong>\u00a0by\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/soundsonline.com\" target=\"_blank\">Eastwest<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>$29.99 &#8211; $49.99\/month<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A terrific solution for anyone looking to expand or cultivate a wide palette with just one purchase.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":24,"featured_media":2294,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_is_tweetstorm":false},"categories":[1307],"tags":[1341,983,1339,1336,1342],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/CC_3.png","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/s202Ia-ewcloud","_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2290"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/24"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2290"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2290\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2294"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2290"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2290"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2290"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
