I read on Mark Mosher's <a href="http://twitter.com/MarkMosher">Twitter feed</a> that Ableton is recommending users of LIVE avoid the upgrade&#8230; at least until Ableton can release an update in a few weeks that's guaranteed to be rock-solid.<br /><div><br />My Adobe Creative Suite (version 2) will also have to be upgraded&#8212;it's not compatible with Snow Leopard, either. Kontakt 3 and above are reported to be compatible, as is Digital Performer 6&#8230; and beyond that, my software list currently has far too many "unknowns" for me to make the leap to (Snow) Leopard. Not yet, anyway.</div><div>All this <i>drama</i> for a software upgrade that is almost entirely "under the hood"&#8212;! Sort of reminds me of the bad old days of, say, System 8. If you weren't there, you didn't miss a thing. Promise.</div><div><br />So here's your thread&#8212;I hope the new OS doesn't <b>provoke</b> you too much! But please let us know what's working, what is not working, and any solutions you might have. This is one of the great things about the community. We can get this info out there <i>quickly</i>.<br /><br />P.S. PC users&#8230; keep smirking.

<div>As much as I love and live for television drama, I've yet to actually compose for a single episode, and though deep down that's really what I'd love to do, part of me wonders if extreme physical and mental investment required just to do the job, never mind to the job well, is really that enjoyable... so in the meantime (whilst I psyche myself up for it a bit more) here are a few ways I've gotten my tunes on the TV without going mental from overwork ;-)...<br />
<br />
Up until now, I've written primarily for the UK market. I've scored one-off hour-long documentary 'specials', licensed pre-written music for documentaries, and composed scores for television documentary movies.<br />
<br />
Not a lot of drama in there. Ah well, the docs were still pretty dramatic in places!<br />
<br />
Rather than discuss the process of composing music for documentary (which, for all intents and purposes, is actually pretty similar to composing for drama), I thought it might be more useful to talk about the ways my naive younger self navigated the turbulent waters of the royalty system.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Royalties - The Holy Grail</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">Royalties are the reason that we, as composers, rather like writing for television broadcast products. So long as you don't sign all those lovely copyrights away (and, seriously now, you really shouldn't. Ever.), every broadcasted minute of your music should return actual hard cash into your pocket. Just for being aired. You didn't have to do anything to get it (except write it in the first place, of course). It's your right. How very lovely, eh?&nbsp;Which is a relief because the upfront fee one gets paid for these broadcast products is usually a bit rubbish.</span></span></div><div><br />
To be honest, one of the hour-long special I wrote a few tracks for paid well, basically as I was writing the titles and credits music along with a couple of underscores. It's also probably something to with the fact that I was also working with this small company already as a production assistant/sound recordist/coffee-maid and so I was working with friends, who wouldn't see me screwed over money-wise.<br />
<br />
However, I was young and naive and didn't know I had to register with PRS (Performing Rights Society, a royalty collection agency) to get royalties. Duh.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Royalty Collection Societies</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">I didn't even know I was entitled to royalties. It's something they really should drill into you at Film School, but for me it was just a footnote that passed me buy. You live and learn...</span></span></div><div><br />
Three years later I sat with a publisher who talked me through my options - he found my details on the PRS database, and whilst it didn't say exactly what I was owed, it was a sizeable chunk and I left the meeting elated... only to talk on the phone with PRS for them to tell me I wasn't entitled to it.</div><div></div><div>I wasn't a registered member, and even if I became one I wouldn't be able to claim for anything broadcast more than  6 months ago. Gutted does not even begin to describe how I felt. In fact I felt downright stupid.<br />
<br />
Turns out there was a silver lining... the publisher I spoke to originally agreed to represent me in order that I might claim the money back through him, for a small commission, of course, but that's the price you pay for being rather naive.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Music... For Free????</b><br />
<b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">I was approached another time by a colleague who was working on a low budget documentary and couldn't offer to pay any money for music, but wondered if I could license a few tracks in my catalogue that would fit the bill.</span></b></div><div><br />
Now... this is a tricky situation. Provide music for no remuneration? No way! I hear you exclaim... but let me explain further.<br />
<br />
The documentary was guaranteed to be broadcast at least twice on one of the (then) big four terrestrial channels we have in the UK (BBC1, BBC2, ITV, Channel4). And it was primetime. At this time that meant millions of viewers (sadly becoming unheard of now with the recent explosion of channels).<br />
<br />
I knew from the aformentioned previous experience that this would, again, be a decent wadge of cash at some point in the not too distant future for an otherwise out-of-work composer. It was also a very good credit on my (then) pitiful resume.<br />
<br />
So I said yes. I'm actually rather glad I did - whilst it's a little morally reprehensible for them to not even offer a token amount as acknowledgement of the transaction, the royalties from that little documentary keep coming in. It's been repeated again and again, they wheel it out without fail every year at a certain seasonal time. I loves me a little passive income, I does.<br />
<br />
A producer once said to me, a little apologetically, to be fair - 'there's no line in the budget for music'. No line? Not even the mention of music? I still negotiated a smidgeon of an upfront fee, and at the time the money was very welcome, and again gained a rather nice credit.<br />
<br />
This time it was for a feature-length documentary, destined primarily for British television, but the company had a track record of selling their documentary films abroad to Europe, the US and Japan. Great! I thought. Worldwide royalty returns!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cultural Differences</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">But, again, I needed a little education on how differently the television royalty systems of the world function. Apparently (and you guys over there in the States can let me know if I'm right or not on the former) in the US and Japan royalties aren't worth collecting for a one-off showings on local networks. Cue sheets probably won't even get filed. Ugh. So no dosh there.</span></span></div><div><br />
The UK royalties were, again, rather nice, but nothing to write home about, and certainly didn't cover what I coulda shoulda charged upfront.&nbsp;I was a little disgruntled. Sure, I'd gotten a nice credit, but that doesn't pay for the roof over your head and the food on your plate.&nbsp;That was until... the European royalties came through. My goodness me. That paid for it and then some. Lovely lovely lovely.<br />
<br />
So the lesson is... sell to Europe! They're rather generous ;-)<br />
<br />
Oh, and also, get registered with your Royalty Collection Society as soon as you've had anything broadcast on the tellybox. Tout de suite.</div><br />

Among many others, I engineered music for the <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" rel="wikipedia" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> series <i>thirtysomething </i><span style="font-style: normal;">with composers Stewart Levin and Snuffy Walden, and then </span><i>Northern Exposure</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> with composer David Schwartz. Both started out in fairly modest home studio settings with simple gear, and as the shows and composers gained more success, their studios became more sophisticated. They wrote some of the coolest music I've had the pleasure of working on, and I still remember those experiences fondly.<o:p></o:p></span><br />
<div class="MsoNormal"><br />
So, I am way familiar with the "standard" model of how most television scoring is done these days, based on multitrack production techniques, using MIDI and audio tracks. Each part is carefully crafted and laid in, one at a time, until it sounds complete. Mixing might be done right then when the cue is finished (if the composer also wears the mixer hat) or at the end when all the cues are finished, in which case it's often a long late rush for the mixer to finish and make the delivery deadline.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
But there is another way to crack that weekly score recording nut, and that's with a live studio date with live real-time mixing. This may seem like an old-fashioned approach at first, but there are some great advantages, with very contemporary techniques, for the composer with an appropriate musical style and the courage to go for it. It can give you some of your life back, for one thing, with no more red-eyed late nights cranking out mixes, and may even be more budget-friendly then you might suppose. Most importantly, there's nothing like the excitement of putting expert musicians in a room together; they will almost always give you more than you could ever come up with by yourself, and make it look easy.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
Let's take a look at a couple of recent scores I worked on, and their productions:</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Secret Life</span></div><div class="MsoNormal">Composer Dan Foliart has scored dozens of the most successful shows on TV, so I was excited to get the call recently to work with him on an episode of <i><a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1179817/" rel="imdb" title="The Secret Life of the American Teenager (Season 1)">The Secret Life Of The American Teenager</a> </i><span style="font-style: normal;">(ABC Family), to record at the famous Capitol Studio B. Dan has always been a big proponent of live players mixed live, and hires some of the best musicians in LA, so I knew this was going to be fun.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BuLoKjFVAyg/SoTOu0AfI8I/AAAAAAAAAAM/q9KbO1A_6ho/s1600-h/23_DF_DFoliart_Capitol_mid.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5369643959362462658" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BuLoKjFVAyg/SoTOu0AfI8I/AAAAAAAAAAM/q9KbO1A_6ho/s400/23_DF_DFoliart_Capitol_mid.jpg" style="display: block; height: 315px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 282px;" /></a>Certain types of parts in a score work better performed "live" than others; synth/sample type parts are often better prepared and pre-recorded in advance. Dan's "synthestrator", Steve Morrell, records his parts, and also a click track, at home in Logic and then brings it in on a disk on where it's imported into Pro Tools before the other musicians arrive. It comes up on extra faders where I balance it in with the other instruments.</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
<span style="color: black;">The mix we hear in the control room is approved by Dan, but there are a couple of levels of safety net. Separate instrument tracks are saved in Pro Tools, in case there needs to be an overdub or a remix is requested. In addition, in the computer session file, the mixed tracks are routed to separate "stems", divided into sections of the mix such as rhythm, guitars, keyboards, etc. That way on the dub stage, if the mixer puts up all tracks equally then he will hear it as I did, but if he wishes, he can duck certain parts, such as if a melody conflicts with dialog.<o:p></o:p> ("Stems" mixing is often requested by producers; in a future column I will go into more detail explaining exactly how it should be done.)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: black;">Now for the cool part! Dan's well-oiled team of session players made quick work of the cues, adding their unique controlled excitement and sparkle. His band of drums, percussion, piano, bass, and guitar knew just what to do. With a few notes to them by Dan on performance, and to me on the sound, the score was in the can within a three-hour date. In fact there was a few minutes to spare for a couple of Frank Sinatra songs, just for fun! And my work was basically done and off the clock at the same time as the musicians. Ship it! Lunch!</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;King of the Hill<span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Composer Greg Edmonson has been scoring episodes of the animated comedy, <i>King of the Hill (</i><span style="font-style: normal;">Fox)</span><i>, </i><span style="font-style: normal;">for a few years now. A typical show might have as many as 30 music starts. After spotting, he gets busy writing in his personal studio, and then works with his long-time guitarist, </span>Craig Stull, recording audio tracks there in Logic.<br />
<br />
In order to carefully produce and layer the guitar parts, they are recorded in advance. In the case of <i>King of the Hill,</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> maybe half of the total score is guitar-only cues, often with 2, 3, or more layered guitar parts, electric, acoustic, dobro. The remainder of the score will also feature a small orchestra, usually as the plot gets more intense or comes to a conclusion. On these cues there are also often guitar parts, which are layered in advance (with temp synth orchestra).</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: normal;">&nbsp;</span>With me at the board, we balance and process the guitar parts and lay down a stereo mix track in Logic, as well as an audio track of click, and any other final elements will usually get their own stereo mix track or "stem". I note the time code at that tracks' start time (not the same as the downbeat, bar 1 beat 1); this will be used in the next step, which is to place these tracks into the scoring template in <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Tools" rel="wikipedia" title="Pro Tools">ProTools</a> HD.<br />
<br />
So, after pre-mixing and exporting those audio files, we switch off Logic and turn to ProTools, where I import them and spot them to the correct time code positions. Note that in Logic there is a separate file for each cue, but in ProTools all of the cues will be in the same single session file. That is so on the scoring stage with the orchestra sitting there no one will have to fool around with opening and closing computer files, and re-assigning inputs and outputs. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
This is where I pass the engineering baton to the venerable mixer, Armin Steiner, who mixes the small orchestra (about 20 players) live in a scoring stage or commercial studios, to additional ProTools tracks. There's no additional time to remix after the sessions; when the players go home so does he. On the dubstage they will have available separate stems of orchestra, guitar, and other elements, if they need to re-balance. If all goes according to plan, they can knock off the orchestra recording in a two-hour session. It doesn't seem like much, but it doesn't take long for the magic to happen, and, once again, the added polish, sparkle, and thrill of the expert live musicians playing together raises the vibe and quality of this simple animated show to a new level. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
<b>Living "live"</b></div><div class="MsoNormal">If your score style involves a lot of your own layered performances, or multiple overdubbed tracks by individual musicians, then live tracking may not be for you. But if you can imagine your music played by a band or orchestra, or can adapt your music to that scenario, then why not give it a try? With a good studio and a good team behind you, it's a great way to quickly make music that's exciting; how can that not be a good thing?<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />

<div id='summary8354871565759300521'><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SpJt5qeNdTI/AAAAAAAAAKg/PLkYCs9YMqQ/s1600-h/ogden-tao.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SpJt5qeNdTI/AAAAAAAAAKg/PLkYCs9YMqQ/s320/ogden-tao.png" /></a></div>I've been thinking. I know... scary.<br />
<br />
In almost every industry, the daily tasks of human production have been virtually replaced by automated systems that can do those same tasks quicker and cheaper. We are reminded of this almost nightly on the evening news as we watch them give the latest update on whether or not GM or Ford is going to live to see another sunrise. The images of giant Transformer-like automatons welding hood ornaments and casting car parts is almost reminiscent of a few science fiction scripts I've read lately. <br />
<br />
But, let's look in the mirror. Admit it. When was the last time you used automation as a short-cut to get from Point A to Point B in a cue? Was it yesterday when you used a  looped drum groove? Or was it last Friday when you held down a key to record an arpeggio patch that worked perfectly right out of FM8 or KORE Player? We have all done it. And we do it... because it's easy and quick, meaning it saves us time. And time, as you know... is money. <br />
<br />
Well, that's the <i>internal</i> version, but the internal version has paved the way now for the <i>external</i> version: Automation having finally trickled down to television music where library tracks reign supreme and humans are expendable, if even invited to the party. <br />
<br />
Look around. Everyone... and I do mean EVERYONE...&nbsp; is getting onboard the library wagon train. Why? Well, from a producer's standpoint, it's simple: Libraries take the hassle out of dealing with YOU. When producers and showrunners don't have to deal with us pain-in-the-ass composers, their jobs are suddenly simplified. Humans take patience, understanding, and mercy. Robots... not so much. <br />
<br />
In fact, robots don't really take anything. They just do what they are programmed to do... which, essentially is anything a human can program (nice vicious circle, huh?). Even still, there are a million things that a robot could never do.<br />
<br />
Maybe one of the greatest things that robots cannot do is organize things in a generalized way. Take our world of music for media as an example. Automated systems, no matter how intelligent they become, can never construct a wholly functional musical score to a film or television program because that act would require reasoning via generalization &#8212; a native human action of which the result is not reproducible by an automated system. <br />
<br />
Confused yet? This might help:<br />
<br />
The Oxford English Dictionary defines &#8220;generalize&#8221; as:<br />
<br />
<blockquote><i>To form general notions by abstraction from particular instances; to arrive at or express general inferences.</i></blockquote><br />
Put into film music terms, generalization would be the process of building a complete and coherent musical framework from a disorganized set of needs and objectives. This is our job, and again, one that cannot be replicated by an automated system.<br />
<br />
I've learned, in my limited experience, that most of what we do as composers is misunderstood by the Average Joe, and quite frankly, not really respected by most folks. I mean, let's face it: Musicians as a people group are not really known for being taken seriously by the general public. People don't <i>get</i> what we do, let alone <i>how</i> we do it, and we are most often looked at as the "slackers" of the artistic world, just a few levels above the jobs we had in high school. I've often joked in some of our podcasts that my own mother still thinks I moved away from home to "play that rock 'n roll!"<br />
<br />
Add to all this the fact that with filmmaking going mainstream as of late, the pressure is on us to write faster, utilizing much smaller budgets &#8212; which can make it very hard for us to maintain our professionalism throughout the scoring process. The eventual final destination of this rabbit-hole would be to cease utilizing the creative side of our brains altogether, rendering us... well... robots.<br />
<br />
So back to libraries... the <i>automated robot</i> version of our <i>human being</i> composer selves. Do they serve a purpose? Yes. Are they omniscient in their service to filmmakers and TV showrunners? Of course not. Is there room for composers and libraries to co-exist moving forward into the "library age" of television? Absolutely. What will it take to maintain the role of "composer" moving forward into the "library age"?<br />
<br />
As I was saying earlier, most people don't know what we do, and they don't know what we do because they do not value what we do. And they do not value what we do because we have let our value as an important and undeniable piece of the filmmaking puzzle fizzle and fade just a bit.<br />
<br />
<b>Change Yourself First </b><br />
One way to reverse this trend is to stop the automation within our own processes from taking a higher priority in our music. That means less reliance on loops and more woodshedding on becoming a virtual finger drummer. This means less reliance on Symphobia, and more orchestration study and orchestral theory chops. This means less "crutch work" with the arpeggiator and more "clutch work" with your own played patterns. Each of these examples I've just listed will make your music sound much more realistic and listenable to your directors and producers, not to mention that it will just simply make YOU better as a composer. When you rely on "found sound" to make music <i>for</i> you, you immediately cut yourself off at the knees.<br />
<br />
<b>Re-Educate the Principals </b><br />
The second thing we can do to reverse these trends is to begin to re-educate the principals. I went through this a few years ago when I found out that a buddy of mine who owns a post-house was hired to cut and paste library music into a sports show he was posting for a company back East. I talked him and the producers into the idea that if they would hire me to compose a "custom" library for their show, then I could guarantee more for them than the "false freedom" that a library would provide. My custom music would mean that their show would have an identity that they could not piece together easily with a library. It also meant that they could forecast ahead with me and make special requests of me for music &#8212; something that would be impossible with a pre-determined set of library cues.<br />
<br />
Look... Libraries are here. They aren't going anywhere, and they are becoming more and more popular as the days roll by. Get used to it. But you have the power, the skills, and hell... I'll GIVE you the permission, if that's what you are waiting for... to go out and turn those library gigs into custom library gigs that only YOU can provide for your clients. All it takes is a little salesmanship and a little hunger, and you can do it.<br />
<br />
So go on. Turn the tide back in your favor. Put those good old fashioned human business chops back to work and start thinking outside the box a little with your career. The old traditional ways of the Hollywood Studio System (Read: The way movies used to get made) are a thing of the past. It's time to mount an offensive and take a proactive stance in helping to redefine what the next big wave of progression is going to look like for the film and television composing industry.<br />
<br />
Tell me in the COMMENTS how you think you can make changes that would re-educate potential filmmaker employers as to the value of having a human do the job. If we are going to ever reclaim the "Value of Television" music, as Lee Sanders described in a must-read article <a href="2009/08/value-of-television-music.html">here</a>, then how are we to do it? <br />
<br />
And maybe, since this is a call to action that I'm putting out here... I'll lead by proposing a slogan for the campaign:<br />
<br />
<blockquote><b><i>Never send a machine to do a human's job.</i></b></blockquote><br />
<br />

The right compressor settings can turn a flabby bass sound into a snappy, tight groove monster. A bit of soft clipping can transform a mediocre synth sound into a blistering lead. One of the more unique uses of effects to support the core rhythmic structure of a song is <a href="http://www.amnesta.net/edge_delay/">The Edge's use of guitar delay</a> in "Where the Streets Have No Name" and a myriad other U2 classics. And from the evidence of this technique all over today's television shows and ads, it seems to be far from being shunned as outdated or overused.<br /><br />One of my favorite TV commercials is a recent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=ZScyn90yhDY#t=30">Velspar Paint</a> ad. For one, it's <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">not </span>REALLY LOUD like most commercials these days, which is a huge relief and probably one of the reasons why I was drawn into it to begin with.  The visuals are a study in over-saturated beauty - lots of slow motion visual FX of "colors" dripping off of natural objects. The music promotes a "beyond time" vibe with a sparse piano arrangement that is held up by use of a tempo-synchronized delay. It certainly could have been done by "traditional" arranging - playing those notes directly on the piano instead of relying on the delay to carry the pattern through, but I don't think it would have had the same dramatic effect - my guess is that it would have come off too heavy. I think there are plenty of examples in television where delay is used as a crutch to make a cue <span style="font-style: italic;">seem</span> busier than it actually is - but this is one case where I think it's pitch-perfect.<br /><br />Anyway, that's just one example of how effects can be used to underpin a cue. I'm curious to know what other Scorecasters might have picked up along the way - both in examples of what to do, and what <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">not </span>to do. Any favorite examples, tips or tricks?</div>

<div id='summary5798488239252674389'><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SpAqjIZJXCI/AAAAAAAAAgc/YurKoE0ATUs/s1600-h/sanders-provocation.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SpAqjIZJXCI/AAAAAAAAAgc/YurKoE0ATUs/s320/sanders-provocation.png" /></a></div>This weekend's Provocation takes the form of a question. Maybe I'm jumping the gun a bit, as we're planning a month-long focus on marketing in the not-too-distant future, but it's a topic that deserves extended advance planning. That's my excuse, anyway, and I'm sticking to it. :-)<br />
<br />
The question is this: <b>What is your Unique Selling Proposition?</b><br />
<br />
Some quick background: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_selling_proposition">USP</a> is a concept that's crucial to marketing campaigns worldwide. The goal of formulating a USP&#8212;its reason for existing&#8212;is to distill the product (you!) into a one-sentence summary. Buy this product and you will get this benefit&#8230; that you can get nowhere else. Bounty, for example, is the "quicker picker-upper;" FedEx is the go-to company "when it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight."<br />
<br />
Both these USPs have been phenomenally successful in positioning their companies at the top of their particular product ladder. I'm sure you can think of countless others&#8230; and that's the point! A successful USP is snappy. It's memorable. It slips past critical thought and simply <i>becomes</i> the way the target perceives the product.<br />
<br />
As composers, though, we're in competition with more than simply a few rival brands. Each of us is, or should be, a brand unto ourselves. How would you characterize your favorite composer's USP? Hard-hitting, synth-augmented simplicity? Ingenious orchestral color and quirkiness? It's probably not difficult to define your favorite composers with a USP&#8212;it stems in large part from their artistic voice.<br />
<br />
So&#8230; this weekend's provocation asks you to do something similar for yourself. Defining your own USP is another way of asking you to label yourself as an artist.<br />
<br />
That's difficult. And by the way? I'd also say it's inadvisable as a full-time pursuit. In general it's better to focus on making the music the best it can be, and leaving the analysis to critics and fan sites.<br />
<br />
Every once in a while, though, I think it's important to step back and take at least a stab at self-awareness&#8212;if only as an aid to marketing, demo packaging, and selecting which projects you're going to invest time and energy attempting to land.<br />
<br />
So I'd love to hear your USP. Don't be shy. If you are the world's pre-eminent composer for kazoo, let us know. If you're the person who scores every project with sampled cat meows, well, that would make for an interesting comment, too. Jump in and let's figure out which USPs work and which don't&#8212;and why (or why not).<br />

You know the kind: "Here's the hard, bitter truth about [insert choice of profession here]."<br />
<br />
The way I see it, more cold water (cold <i>ink</i>?) is simply unnecessary. You know the long hours required to improve, to get your name out there, to advance in this career. You're already aware that the odds of making a decent living as a composer are comparable to the odds of becoming a pro athlete. You know that fame and glamour are overrated; besides, they're all but non-existent in our little corner of the music world. And none of that is why you write music anyway. You do it because you have to. There's no choice in the matter.<br />
<div><br />
On the other hand, it's important to know the terrain. And there I think I can help&#8212;although it <i>is</i> going to feel a little&#8230; hypothermic&#8230; for a while. So let's just jump in and get used to it. Then we can start talking about how to swim.<br />
<br />
In the year 2009, the value of most television music is <b>zero</b> (<i>brrr</i>&#8230; chilly). That is to say, if you're just starting out (or even if you're established!) the kinds of gigs where you can get music placed immediately and actually used on TV no longer pay money up front. You'll likely be creating and submitting music library cues&#8212;thus, not even writing to picture!&#8212;and there will be no front-end compensation for your time, energy, love or gear investment.<br />
<br />
I know, because in the last week I've been offered precisely this gig&#8212;twice. One e-mail was from a producer on a Top 10 network television show. You'd know the name if I said it.<br />
<br />
This producer actually had the audacity to write: "Unfortunately we cannot pay any up front money but if we end up using your music in the show you would receive royalties on the back end." His reluctance to insert commas makes the sentence read as though he's trying to get it all out in one breath&#8212;as though if he took the time to breathe, the sheer ridiculousness of what he's asking would dawn on him and he'd delete his request in shame.<br />
<br />
Except there's no shame here. These offers are being made with a straight face&#8230; and to much more experienced and accomplished composers than Yours Truly. So I didn't take it personally. I simply referred both these correspondents to a colleague of mine. I've partnered with this particular colleague on a music library project, and every once in a while (when things are slow around our studios) we'll kick out a couple of tracks. Over the last several months we've accumulated a pretty decent library as a result&#8230; all solid stuff, all completely owned by us and available to license again and again and again.<br />
<br />
So, when that lowball network TV offer came in, it required zero energy to deliver to this producer (who is a potential New Contact&#8212;crappy deal offer aside, that has value down the road!) the kind of music he needed. High-quality, high-volume, no commitment. My colleague has agreed to handle all the contract stuff and the technical aspects of delivery, and I've agreed that he'll get a little more of whatever money the library brings in.<br />
<br />
Sad to say the two of us are getting a <i>lot</i> of these kinds of e-mails lately. We've been asked to submit our library to <i>nine shows</i> in the last month alone&#8212;and that, my friends, constitutes a <i>trend</i>.<br />
<br />
If what I've just described could be seen as a frontal assault on our revenue stream, get ready for more bad news: our rear is also under attack (I know, I know&#8230; mixing metaphors: water and warfare. You can handle it). Two cable networks <i>that I know of</i> are attempting to negotiate composer contracts that take away 50% of writer's share royalties (presumably assigning them to an entity representing the network, so that the score for their shows are even more of a net money-maker for them). They're trying this primarily with less-established composers at present; if they succeed, however, it's a safe bet that they'll consider this Standard Operating Procedure in future contract negotiations.<br />
<br />
Scary stuff. Seriously. Even scarier when you consider that they could take out an ad on Craigslist tomorrow and get hundreds of demo packages from hungry, hopeful composers. If we're talking cold water here, this scenario is a scene straight out of <i>Titanic</i>. Post-iceberg.<br />
<div>So how can you survive the squeeze? And what does all of this bad news portend for the future of music in television?<br />
<br />
Fortunately, there are a few bright spots. We've talked before (in the comments) about the handful of television shows that still allow for a live orchestra; the fact that those shows are perennial Emmy front-listers bodes well for perceptive producers and network executives. It may be true that, to get on the playing field in the TV music game, you only need to be about a "five" on a scale of ten, but the quality difference becomes obvious when it's time to hand out little gold statues.<br />
<br />
The next bright spot: the proliferation of channels out there. Five hundred channels, and they all need music. In most cases they're not willing to pay much, but the opportunities to get at least some experience in the medium has never been greater. If the Industry still contains even a teensy little particle of meritocracy (and I think it does), the sheer volume of music required means that great new composers have a legitimate chance to rise&#8230; make connections&#8230; get noticed. And move upward and onward to the gigs they deserve.<br />
<br />
Also, it's important to note that producers and execs for <i>scripted</i> television, particularly in the realm of premium television channels such as HBO, Showtime and others, still care enough to fight for proper composer compensation&#8212;and even niceties like reasonable composer schedules. Those producers care about quality, and are still dedicated to the idea that the composer is a key member of the creative team. It's a breath of fresh air to take meetings with these people.<br />
<br />
But if you really want to "beat the game" of shrinking budgets and schedules and command the kind of respect that you're due as a composer, here's the most important technique I know. Make your network more than just a means to an end. Make your connections your friends. Make 'em your <i>soulmates</i>. Make a real, personal bond with the people who will be hiring you. Do it as part of your long-term strategy&#8230; hell, do it as part of making your life better.<br />
<br />
Here's why: humans (and, believe it or not, most Hollywood players are, in fact, human&#8212;at least on some level) don't screw over their friends. They take care of their in-group. Be part of that group.<br />
<br />
There's a great line in an episode of <i>The West Wing</i> (just looked it up: it's "The Black Vera Wang") that's stuck with me ever since I watched it for the first time: "Don't talk to me like I'm other people." I think that has some resonance here.<br />
<br />
Many years ago, I wrote a fan letter to a TV composer. One of the things I asked him&#8212;after raving in obsessive detail about his scores&#8212;was whether he thought it was possible for someone like me, from the middle of nowhere, to make the trek out to Hollywood and get active in the business. Moreover, I wanted to know whether, with a bit of luck and as much hard work as required, I could expect to make a decent living at this career.<br />
<br />
I'm from a small, solidly middle-class family with no friends or family in the Industry whatsoever. No safety net, no one to serve as a "rabbi" and introduce me around. I needed to know whether it was even possible to contemplate before diving in. Would the water simply be too cold&#8212;and me without a wetsuit?<br />
<br />
The composer replied: "I think you're just the kind of obsessed dreamer who actually has a shot. Eventually it comes down to some luck, but if you pay dues long enough, and if you're fairly good, you'll find work. And in TV all you need is one hit that goes five seasons and then into syndication. After that you can retire if you like."<br />
<br />
I'd like to tell you it's all still true today, but that last part isn't even close. Not anymore. Too much of the cost of creating the music (maintaining a world-class synth rig, mixing, paying for musicians, etc.) has been passed on to us as an ongoing expense, and the squeeze at both front- and back-end has made this career less of a dream and more just something to do for a living.<br />
<br />
But like I said: we do it because we have to. That alone should warm up the water&#8230; at least a little. Or maybe we composers are just preternaturally fond of the cold.</div></div><br />

Who knows, maybe I'll need it someday, right? It was <em>pretty</em> clear in my head, but not as crystal clear as other times. Sometimes I feel like I'm just regurgitating what I hear in my head! Not so last night, it was like trying to hold sand with my hands.<br /><div></div><div>And it showed in the cue- it was not good. But it still sounded okay in my head, although it was still not totally clear.</div><div></div><div>Times like this make me wonder whether I should "abort mission" and walk away from the cue, or whether I should continue to hammer away at it, like some sort of blacksmith. I wonder how the SCOREcasters deal with such situations? Or is there some in-between ground, e.g., work on a different cue for a few days then return to it. What sometimes works for me is to just take my hands off the keys, close my eyes, and listen to the piece in my head, let it finish developing a bit more, bring it out of my subconscious. Sometimes that works.</div><div></div><div>What do you do? Salvage your cue? Your time? Or some of both? I figured I'd throw it out there for you to chew on.</div></div>

<div id='summary6929683447383117595'><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SpArLcpoDII/AAAAAAAAAg0/M0mbXco_zWY/s1600-h/ogden-confab.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SpArLcpoDII/AAAAAAAAAg0/M0mbXco_zWY/s320/ogden-confab.png" /></a></div>Oh.... we HATE to say it! That "dirty phrase" in composing that we prefer to avoid, yet it comes up in conversation almost daily. Every successful composer says they will not do it, but most of them do it anyway. Most composers, working or not, condemn the idea, but there seems to be no way around it and it almost feels like a necessary evil if you want to be successful at this gig.<br />
<br />
I recently attended a panel where a group of popular TV and film composers were assembled to talk about their work and answer questions from a hungry crowd made up mostly of new people wanting to break into the industy. The talk turned to how many shows a person could handle writing for at one time. A question from the audience came up for one of the composers who is currently writing for several successful shows in network TV.<br />
<br />
"Do you do it all?", the audience member asked.<br />
<br />
"I do it all myself," said the composer, "and it's difficult, but I just have to discipline myself and it all works out."<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I know for a fact that that was a bald-face lie. That composer does <i><b>NOT</b></i> do it all themselves.<br />
<br />
<b>They have "ghosts".</b><br />
<br />
Let me offer this honest (and quite common) scenario, and you tell me what's right and what's wrong:<br />
<br />
You just landed the gig of your life &#8212; you are composing for a new show on one of the big TV networks and the show is a runaway sensation... And so are you &#8212; in fact, you've never seen weekly checks like this since you started composing, and your projected backend <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royalties" rel="wikipedia" title="Royalties">royalties</a> in nine months are looking pretty damned amazing (You might even be able to pony up the down payment on that house you've had your eye on!).<br />
<br />
All of this success has now put you on the radar of many execs, and you are getting job offers left and right. The thing is though, if you were to let the world see you sweat in your little project studio, you are barely treading water and it's everything you can do to just keep up with the pace of the show you are on now.<br />
<br />
At the same time, you know it's Business Smarts 101 to "take every gig", and just because you are now writing for a weekly smash hit, that rule doesn't stop applying.<br />
<br />
The choice is simple: <i>You need a ghost if you are going to take more on</i>. Simple as that.<br />
<br />
But how do you feel about that concept?<br />
<br />
Honestly? EVERYONE does it. I mean, they just <i>do</i>. I'm not kidding. All the big boys do it, and I just know this because I've hung around with many of them and they'll just eventually tell you in secret that they couldn't do it all if they didn't employ a <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostwriter" rel="wikipedia" title="Ghostwriter">ghostwriter</a>. Simple. Back in the day, several classical composers even had ghosts, and nobody seems to be mad at <i>them</i> for it, so what's the big deal?<br />
<br />
<blockquote><b>So here it is:</b><br />
<i>Is having a ghost a necessary evil to enjoying a long career as a composer? If so, do you tell, or is it ethical to just say you do it yourself? What about backend? Should your ghosts get theirs, or should they simply be paid as an employee and that's that? Is there another alternative to getting all the work you can and still being able to go it alone? If so, what are some of those scenarios?</i></blockquote><br />
Jump in on the COMMENTS below, and let's hear your thoughts... and, let's be honest about it. No hurt feelings... no opinions that aren't valid, yada, yada, yada.<br />
<br />
It IS what it IS, and it's something that, sooner or later, you are going to have to confront one way or another. At least, we <i>hope</i> so, right?<br />
<br />

I'm on an ear break here at the Musicave, but I wanted to break in here before the weekend and share a link to a blurb I read today on Backstage's website.<br />
<br />
It's just the nature of showbiz that many times you look around at what you've accomplished - or not accomplished - and think to youself, "Why didn't I takn the <i>Blue</i> pill?"<br />
<br />
On that, read the article and then come back here in the COMMENTS and tell me if your opinion on having a "Plan B". Support your viewpoint with an example from your own experience if you can. Let's examine this together. Call me curious today. :o)<br />

<br />
So I thought I'd offer up a little Friday anecdote for your amusement as you crank away on your homework assignment:&nbsp;<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Kissing the Shoe.</span><br />
<b><br />
</b><br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">It was 2001, and the first cycle of <i>The Amazing Race</i> was underway. No one knew whether there would be a second cycle&#8212;9/11 had just happened, and it was very much an open question whether we could send teams of contestants outside of the USA without incurring serious risks. (imagine, if you will, <i>The Amazing Race: Burbank Edition</i>). So there was incredible pressure on everyone to make this thing special, because we might not ever do it again.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">Enter the temp track, and your humble narrator. Back in those days everything on that show was custom-scored, believe it or not&#8230; we were just about the only reality TV show to do it that way. The temp scores for the episodes were assembled from a Bruckheimer-approved list of existing scores that included <i>Crimson Tide</i>, <i>Gladiator</i>, <i>Enemy of the State</i>, <i>The Fugitive</i> and a long list of others&#8230; but you get the idea. Big, epic stuff. The producers loved those scores (of course!).</span></span><br />
<br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">My job was to replicate the sound of those scores&#8212;and the timings to which the scenes had been cut&#8212;at a pace of approximately five minutes of music per day. We turned around an 42-minute episode in 10 days&#8230; including notes.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">So it was the final episode&#8212;113&#8212;and things were getting tense. There was this One Cue (isn't there always?) that resisted all attempts at replacement. I'd done three versions already&#8212;and, while the producers and the network were open to the idea of something different (at least, different enough that we wouldn't all get sued!), they were just completely in love with the temp.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">So I did something that falls into the category of Don't Try This At Home: I invited the lead producer of the show into my studio. And we worked out the changes together. Normally, if a filmmaker suggests something like this, I give them a little prepared speech that ends in the words "&#8230;because that's not how I work," but it was my first TV gig, I wanted to make these people happy, and frankly I didn't know any better.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">Cut to the last paragraph: I lucked out. The producer (who shall remain nameless) dug this one little riff I added, and the more I dropped it in, the more excited he got. Finally, I ended up ripping out most of the cue as it existed and just repeating the riff in various guises and instrumentations.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">After I played back the rough mix of the revised version of this thing, the producer let out an ear-popping string of expletives, and in his excitement&#8230; he bent down and kissed my shoe. Fo' reals.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">Since then I've never experienced such a level of excitement over anything I've written. But I still have that memory as my benchmark of really knocking it out of the park. And one of these days I hope I'll get there again.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">Just thought I'd share&#8230; and I hope you find your own "kissing the shoe" moment as you go from project to project. If you do, or if you already have, jump on the comments and let us know&#8212;and have a great weekend.</span></span></div>

You probably have heard of a few models from Mackie including the Mackie Control, and the HUI. <a href="http://presonus.com/">Presonus </a>and <a href="http://frontierdesign.com/">Frontier Design</a> have entered the market with a single fader unit, and if you&#8217;re Houston Haynes you already use the <a href="http://www.smartav.net/tango/index.php">SmartAV Tango</a> controller. <a href="http://euphonix.com/">Euphonix</a> has also come out with two lower cost versions of their higher-end controllers, the System 5 and MC Pro. These lower cost versions, the MC Mix and MC Control offer a great deal of features for the price.<br />
<br />
<div class="MsoNormal">DAW controllers have been around for a few years now, but have increased in visibility more and more in project studios and composing rigs.</div><div class="MsoNormal">So, what <i>is</i> a DAW Remote Controller? As we started mixing more in the box, the desire to have more analog style faders to mix increased. Using a mouse became a pain for people used to using a real mixing console. Being able to mix via larger sized faders versus using the mouse became a necessity. Also the ability to control the transport functions (start, stop, record) and even control and automate parameters of plugins, enables you to improve your workflow. With that in mind, manufactures started  producing these remote controllers that look like some kind of audio mixer but does not pass any audio. They offer various controls for your DAW parameters and transport functions giving you the simplicity of mixing in the box, the control of a stand-alone <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f800000000015377a" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixing_console" rel="wikipedia" title="Mixing console">mixing board</a>, and the flexibility of the computer. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
These controllers use various protocols to communicate. Mackie Control and HUI are the most common, as well as proprietary protocols such as Euphonix&#8217;s Eucon. These run over <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f80000000000282fe" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_Instrument_Digital_Interface" rel="wikipedia" title="Musical Instrument Digital Interface">MIDI</a>, <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f800000000003ed6d" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus" rel="wikipedia" title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</a> and <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f80000000000149d0" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet" rel="wikipedia" title="Ethernet">Ethernet</a>. Some controllers come in a single fader package and most others offer 4-8 channels. Most of the manufactures allow you to expand your control surface by connecting more of these fader units together, building larger 24 channel units.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23755444@N00/2501620949" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="Apogee with Euphonix control surface" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3124/2501620949_e919c2456f_m.jpg" style="border: medium none; display: block; height: 240px; width: 204px;" /></a><br />
I just recently in the last two months have started using both of the Euphonix models, the MC Control and the MC Mix, together in my studio. I love these things!  Aside from having nice big faders to <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f800000000ad32db3" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_%28recorded_music%29" rel="wikipedia" title="Audio mixing (recorded music)">mix</a> with, I love the control and flexibility these units bring me in my workflow. Now, I have used other controllers in the past, so I am familiar with the overall effectiveness of having one to work with, but let me tell you a few things about these Euphonix models.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
The Euphonix artist series has two models: the MC control, which is a motorized 4-fader touch sensitive model with a wonderful touch screen, and the MC Mix which features a motorized 8-channel touch sensitive unit without the touch screen. Both of these units use the Eucon protocol.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
Eucon is a high-speed bi-directional Ethernet protocol. You hook these units up via Ethernet directly to your computers Ethernet port(s) or via an Ethernet switch. Speeds up to gigabit are supported. The Eucon protocol is 250 times faster than MIDI. Anybody who has experienced the dreadful MIDI logjam (when MIDI notes can&#8217;t be processed fast enough and they end up being fired almost like a machine gun after a period of delay) can testify that having a faster protocol to send data is a big plus. Eucon also offers 1024 steps of resolution versus MIDI&#8217;s 128 steps. This gives you more control of your fades with less zipper noise.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
The Euphonix MC Control has a wonderful color touch screen and has 12 configurable soft keys that can be configured to use not only specific DAW functions, but also standard file-new, open, and save type commands. They also have bank buttons that let you skip faders in groups of 8. The MC Control also has 8 touch sensitive rotary encoders that can be assigned to control plugin parameters, panning, etc. The MC Mix has in addition to the 8 faders, 8 rotary encoders and 8 displays for surround metering, track names and panning.<br />
<br />
The Euphonix system lets you expand up to 36 faders for the ultimate DAW mixing system.</div><div class="MsoNormal">Since the MC&#8217;s support the Mackie Control protocol, HUI as well as Eucon, they can virtually control any application that supports one of these protocols. These controllers work on both the Mac and the PC.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
So as I mentioned, I have been using these controllers in my studio with both DP and Logic Studio 8 and recently Logic Studio 9, as Logic and DP both support the native Eucon protocol. After adding the controller, the DAW recognizes the MC and automatically maps your channels to the faders in the current session that&#8217;s loaded. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
My productivity has increased greatly using these controllers. Having the ability to get to certain large groups of channels quickly, and having transport jog and shuttle controls are nice features. Being able to shuttle audio and MIDI back and forth for precise edits really helps. I use the soft keys to add new audio, MIDI and instrument tracks, and the faders are really nice. Having touch sensitivity allows me when working in Logic, to simply touch a fader and the corresponding Logic track gets selected.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
For me, using the faders for gain riding my mixes is much easy and fulfilling than drawing it in with a mouse. I do use a mouse for very precise editing, but 90% of the time I am using the faders. I don&#8217;t know if I can put a quantitative number to the time I save using these controllers, but I feel myself working much faster. Maybe its just me, but something about having theses controllers in front of me makes me smile. Probably similar to the notion of making your work space an inviting and creative experience. When I sit down to work and these faders start flying around, I get to feel like I&#8217;m on the Big SSL 4K, which I have always dreamed of working on. LOL &#8230;&#8230;I know I am a total techno geek.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
I highly recommend anyone not using a DAW controller to look seriously into getting one. It will greatly improve your workflow and give you the flexibility and control of mixing using large touch sensitive faders. Check out the tutorial and mixing videos on the Euphonix website for more information on these specific controllers. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
Hit the COMMENTS below, SCOREcasters, and tell me your thoughts on using a DAW controller, and if you are using one already, share with us what value it brings to your workflow. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
Happy Mixing!</div><br />

As I&#8217;ve mentioned before, I don&#8217;t watch it &#8211; with the result that I just don&#8217;t have much to say.  Instead, I&#8217;m going to write about something I <span style="font-style: italic;">do </span>know about &#8211; a composing and production project I completed a few months ago.  The project was simple enough that I can give you the <span style="font-style: italic;">details</span> here, but sophisticated enough to make for some interesting discussion.<br />
<br />
Actually, this was a <span style="font-style: italic;">songwriting </span>(and recording) project.  I&#8217;m not going to pretend to be more of an expert song composer or producer than I really am.  I&#8217;m simply going to tell you what I did, and in some cases why &#8211; and leave it to <span style="font-style: italic;">you </span>to shoot holes.  I&#8217;ll also let <span style="font-style: italic;">you </span>figure out how to apply what you read here to any film, television, or other media scoring project.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Something From Nothing</span><br />
<br />
Stylistically, the song is kind of folksy.  There is only one instrument:  an acoustic guitar, mostly finger-picked.  And one vocalist &#8211; me.  Is there a lesson in that?  Well, maybe.  <span style="font-style: italic;">When in doubt, keep it simple.</span><br />
<br />
The song is about <span style="font-style: italic;">the blank page</span> &#8211; and the questions with which it confronts the composer, day in and day out.  How can I get started?  How can I make <span style="font-style: italic;">something from nothing</span>?  And that, in fact, is the name of the song:  <span style="font-style: italic;">Somethin&#8217; From Nothin&#8217;</span>.  You can download the first verse and the accompanying chorus via this link:  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/p6nowf" style="font-style: italic;">Verse1</a> .<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Composing Process</span><br />
<br />
I decided to write the lyrics first, as a challenge to my personal <span style="font-style: italic;">status quo</span>.  Previous to this song, I had never written song lyrics.  I&#8217;ve always been drawn in by the <span style="font-style: italic;">music </span>of songs, and lyrics have usually gone right by me.  I do, however, have some feeling for the rhythm of words and can write a decent poem.  These things helped.<br />
<br />
Still, I confess that I couldn&#8217;t put music completely out of my mind as I penned the lyrics.  There&#8217;s a certain interplay between words and music, and it was difficult to settle on the words and rhythmic structure without having some idea of how they&#8217;d embed in music.  I also found it difficult to shake off stylistic influences from certain songs and artists I had long admired, so I tried not to fight them.<br />
<br />
After I&#8217;d written a complete set of lyrics and started developing the melody and guitar accompaniment in detail, I found some lyrical changes were necessary to make the marriage of lyrics and music work well.  I tried hard not to become too attached to any song element until everything settled out.<br />
<br />
Song lyrics don&#8217;t always tell a story, <span style="font-style: italic;">per se</span>, but these do.  Here's a link to the complete <a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.do" style="font-weight: bold;"></a><a href="http://tinyurl.com/napu6f">Lyrics</a><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Doing the Guitar</span><br />
<br />
During melody and accompaniment development, I spent an entire day attempting to play and sing the song, over and over again, until a solid pattern took hold and my renditions became fairly consistent.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Almost</span>.  Initially I had in mind that I&#8217;d record myself playing the guitar part in real time, but I found it difficult to get through the entire song without messing up somewhere.  In addition, I noticed how hard it was to maintain the right tempo.  I just couldn&#8217;t surmount the quality threshold I&#8217;d set for myself.<br />
<br />
My project deadline was looming.  With only two days to go, I decided to consider <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI"><span style="font-style: italic;">MIDI</span></a> <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">sequencing</a> </span>the guitar part.  I scoured my libraries for a guitar patch that could do the job, and came up with a steel string acoustic called <span style="font-style: italic;">I&#8217;m A Blackbird Guitar</span> from <a href="http://www.soundsonline.com/home.php"><span style="font-style: italic;">EastWest</span></a>'s<span style="font-style: italic;"> <a href="http://www.soundsonline.com/Fab-Four-Virtual-Instrument-pr-EW-170.html">Fab Four</a></span> library &#8211; designed for knocking off <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatles">Beatles</a> </span>songs.  I figured I&#8217;d have a maximum of one day to sequence the guitar part, so I got busy.<br />
<br />
With folk-style finger picking in mind, I wanted the guitar playing to sound as realistic as possible. When sequencing, it&#8217;s easy to create a pattern that sounds cool but would be difficult or impossible for a real guitarist to play &#8211; and therefore, you&#8217;d be unlikely to hear such a pattern in real guitar work.  In real playing, each hand must carefully respect what the other is doing in order to produce a clean, continuous sound that avoids buzzing strings and dull thuds, even at chord changes.  A finger of the left hand (which forms chords) can change position only when doing so will not prematurely terminate a tone sounding on any affected string.  Conversely, a finger of the right hand can pluck a string only when a finger of the left hand isn&#8217;t about to move either onto or off of it.  (Exceptions are made for deliberate hammer-ons and pull-offs.)  The resulting choreography is a little like running underneath a herd of stampeding giraffes &#8211; it greatly constrains what the guitarist does, and thus puts a certain imprint on a picking and chording pattern that says:  <span style="font-style: italic;">this sounds real</span>.<br />
<br />
To make sure my MIDI sequence had this imprint, I used my own playing as a guide.  In other words, the note pattern of the entire 3-1/2 minute sequence captures the way I&#8217;d actually play the song if I could do so reliably enough to meet my quality standard.<br />
<br />
I entered the notes one by one using the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubase">Cubase</a> </span>piano roll and my mouse, carefully studying my actual playing as I went along.  However, before resorting to this tedious method, I tried to find a faster way.  I happen to own a <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.godinguitars.com/godinmultnylonsap.htm">Godin</a> </span>MIDI guitar.  A <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.roland.com/products/en/GR-20/index.html">Roland</a> </span>guitar synth attached to this guitar is capable, in principle, of transforming each string pluck into the corresponding MIDI note and velocity.   I thought this might make it easy for me to get the notes into <span style="font-style: italic;">Cubase </span>as I picked away naturally &#8211; figuring that I&#8217;d clean everything up afterward.  But I found that this setup was incredibly finicky and made so many errors that it cost me more time than it saved.  I also tried using <a href="http://www.musiclab.com/products/realgtr_info.htm"><span style="font-style: italic;">RealGuitar 2.2L</span></a>, a virtual instrument created by <span style="font-style: italic;">MusicLab</span>.  In the hands of a keyboardist skilled in its use &#8211; which I&#8217;m <span style="font-style: italic;">not </span>&#8211; it can produce some pretty convincing acoustic guitar parts.  There is also an ability to create custom picking patterns which can then be drag-n-dropped onto a MIDI track in varying orders to create a complete guitar part.  The resulting MIDI tracks, however, are in a special format designed to work only with the guitar samples built into <span style="font-style: italic;">RealGuitar </span>and not with another instrument such as the <span style="font-style: italic;">I&#8217;m A Blackbird Guitar</span> I had selected.  Had I more time to set it up properly, <span style="font-style: italic;">RealGuitar </span>might have produced acceptable results &#8211; but there was no time, and I also recognized that <span style="font-style: italic;">RealGuitar</span>&#8217;s way of doing things would make it awkward for me to match my own playing style without a lot of contortions.  Yet another option I considered was <span style="font-style: italic;">PG Music</span>&#8217;s product, <a href="http://www.pgmusic.com/"><span style="font-style: italic;">Band-in-a-Box</span></a>.  It lets you come up with a guitar part by any of a number of methods, and, unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">RealGuitar</span>, can output a straightforward, easily-edited MIDI sequence.  But <span style="font-style: italic;">Band-in-a-Box</span> is a very complex product and, like <span style="font-style: italic;">RealGuitar</span>, functions in a way that makes recreating one&#8217;s personal playing style more work than I could deal with in a short amount of time.  So, fairly quickly, I concluded that the fastest way to get the result I needed was also the simplest and most direct:  simply entering all the notes by hand.<br />
<br />
With practice, notes can be hand-entered into a piano roll more quickly than you&#8217;d think.  However, the initial result isn&#8217;t likely to sound very realistic, mainly because the note <span style="font-style: italic;">velocities</span> will be constant unless you make them otherwise.  Once again, I analyzed my own playing and found that an emphasis on certain notes was an essential part of the finger-picking style I was sequencing.  To first order, the style had an eighth-note rhythm, but often the stress pattern was <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncopation">syncopated</a> </span>in one of several ways.  Subdividing a 4/4 measure into eight equal parts numbered from 1 to 8, I found, for example, that in one characteristic pattern, subdivisions 4 and 8 were stressed.  In another lick, the stress was on 1, 4, and 7.  And so on.  And then, there were additional variations reflecting the flow of the song and particularly leading into transitions.  And there was an instrumental break in the middle of the song, which required more emphasis.  So, yes, I went through and edited all the velocities by hand, taking into account all of these factors.<br />
<br />
Timing nuances also affected the perception of realism.  For example, I noted that when I play in this particular style, there are times when I pluck two strings, <span style="font-style: italic;">nominally </span>at the same time.  Generally this is accomplished by a <span style="font-style: italic;">pinching </span>motion, in which my thumb plucks one of the lower-pitched strings while another finger moves in the opposite direction to pluck a higher string.  However, I usually put a slight <span style="font-style: italic;">delay </span>between the two notes.  When sequencing, and especially if quantization is turned on, the tendency will be for these two notes to be precisely simultaneous &#8211; which doesn&#8217;t sound realistic.  You have to put in the delay.  Thus, I searched the song for instances that warranted making deliberate timing adjustments like these, and edited note start and end times accordingly.<br />
<br />
I should point out that I had quantization turned <span style="font-style: italic;">off </span>when entering most of the notes, relying only on the visual grid to guide me.  This practice introduces a certain amount of timing randomness that can help eliminate a machine-like sound.  And on top of my <span style="font-style: italic;">deliberate </span>velocity and timing edits, I used <span style="font-style: italic;">Cubase </span>to apply a small amount of randomness to both of these attributes.  But I don&#8217;t think that applying randomness, by itself, is a good strategy for obtaining a realistic feel.  It's still necessary to study the nuances of real playing and emulate those deliberately.<br />
<br />
I did some tempo editing as well, though probably less than I should have.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Cubase</span>, like most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Workstation">DAW</a> applications, makes graphical editing of the tempo contour pretty easy.  I used this mostly in the last verse to provide dramatic rubato.  Although I wanted the tempo to be fairly steady for the most part, I could have improved the interpretation and humanization of the song by judiciously adding rubato in other places.  On the other hand, recording the guitar first meant that in my vocal, I would have had to be very careful to follow the guitar&#8217;s timing &#8211; the reverse of the leader-follower relationship I&#8217;d expect in a real performance.  Having a lot of tempo variation would have added unwanted complication in the face of a short time schedule.<br />
<br />
In this particular project, guitar note timings and velocities were the primary things that needed tweaking to get a realistic sound.  However, there were some additional things I could have done that might have provided further improvement.  For example, like many guitar virtual instruments these days, <span style="font-style: italic;">I&#8217;m A Blackbird Guitar</span> offers string noises (those <span style="font-style: italic;">eeek </span>sounds you get when sliding along a wrapped string) that can be deliberately invoked by the MIDI sequence.  However, inserting the right type of noise in the appropriate place requires much more careful study, for which I had no time.  There is also an ability to adjust the envelope of each note (attack/hold/delay/sustain/release), which could probably have improved the quality of each note pluck, had I had the time.  And so on.<br />
<br />
By the way, as a result of selecting an <span style="font-style: italic;">EastWest </span>guitar for this project, the guitar track had in it a substantial amount of ambience which is characteristic of all of <span style="font-style: italic;">EastWest</span>&#8217;s sample libraries.  I did not use the reverb built into <span style="font-style: italic;">EastWest</span>&#8217;s playback engine (<span style="font-style: italic;">Play</span>) add more to this ambience.  In fact, I might have preferred a dryer guitar, given that my voice was to be recorded dry.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Capturing the Vocal</span><br />
<br />
Once I had the guitar part nailed down in MIDI, I was ready to record my vocal.  This involved using <span style="font-style: italic;">Cubase </span>to play back the guitar part while simultaneously recording my voice on a separate track, while I monitored the guitar by headphone.  I used a <a href="http://www.rodemic.com/microphone.php?product=K2"><span style="font-style: italic;">Rode K2</span></a> vacuum tube condenser microphone with a cardioid pickup pattern, running the mike into an <a href="http://www.avalondesign.com/vt737sp.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Avalon Vt-737sp</span></a> channel strip primarily to provide soft compression and a little extra warmth.  For the most part, I set the <span style="font-style: italic;">Vt-737sp</span> according to <span style="font-style: italic;">Avalon</span>&#8217;s recommendations for vocals:  about 6dB of treble boost following the compressor, 4:1 compression, -5 dB threshold, attack and release each at 10 o&#8217;clock.  (It&#8217;s difficult to know exactly what the latter two settings amount to in terms of times.)<br />
<br />
Working at a sample rate of 44.1 KHz, I recorded five takes of the vocal, figuring that none was perfect but that I could pick the best version of each phrase and make a decent composite.  To do this, I lined up the five takes side by side in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Cubase </span>main window and went through the song a phrase at a time, each time choosing what I felt was the best take for that phrase.  For each phrase so found, I extracted a chunk of waveform from the relevant take and glued it into the composite I was creating.   This produced <span style="font-style: italic;">much </span>better results than if I had simply used any of the five raw takes without compositing &#8211; and didn&#8217;t require any entire take to be flawless.<br />
<br />
Next I used <a href="http://www.celemony.com/cms/index.php?id=products_studio"><span style="font-style: italic;">Melodyne Studio</span></a> to correct my pitch, working manually on each note.  I&#8217;ve never been a great singer, and hadn&#8217;t sung at all for about four years before making this recording, so you can imagine my pitch control wasn&#8217;t so hot.  From a pitch standpoint, the corrected result was very good.  However, a noticeable degree of vocal <span style="font-style: italic;">expressiveness </span>was lost in the process of cleaning up the pitch.  I didn&#8217;t recognize the extent of this loss until several hours later, when I was able to make a global assessment of the pitch-corrected vocal.  With hindsight, if I had time to redo the correction, I&#8217;d strive for a better balance between pitch correction and preservation of expression.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Putting It All Together</span><br />
<br />
The last step was to mix the vocal and guitar part into single stereo track.  Before mixing, I processed the composite vocal through an instance of the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.celemony.com/cms/index.php?id=products_studio">TrackPlug</a> </span>plug-in from <a href="http://wavearts.com/"><span style="font-style: italic;">WaveArts</span></a>.  The plug-in was set to roll off the frequencies above 7.6 kHz at -12 dB/octave and apply compression over and above what was done by the <span style="font-style: italic;">Vt-737sp</span>.  The compression parameters at this stage were 4:1 ratio, -17 dB threshold, 0 dB gain, 2 ms attack and 100 ms release, Vintage mode, medium knee.  To balance the guitar with the voice, I dropped the level of the guitar track by 5.6 dB.  No other processing was applied to the guitar before mixing it with the vocal.<br />
<br />
I applied reverb to the result of mixing.  For this I used the <a href="http://www.voxengo.com/product/pspace/"><span style="font-style: italic;">Voxengo Pristine Space</span></a> convolution reverb plug-in loaded with the <span style="font-style: italic;">Small Hall</span> impulse response from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bree Casedy</span> impulse response library available from <a href="http://www.studiodevices.com/"><span style="font-style: italic;">Studio Devices</span></a>.  In my opinion, this is a very good impulse response library.  Wanting a very close-miked sound, I mixed in only a very small amount of reverb, setting the wet level 26 dB below the dry level.<br />
<br />
The last stage of processing was an instance of <span style="font-style: italic;">WaveArts</span>&#8217; <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://wavearts.com/products/plugins/finalplug/">FinalPlug</a> </span>plug-in, which applies peak limiting and an adjustable degree of compression for volume maximization.  I set the compression threshold of this plug-in at -6 dB.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Perspective</span><br />
<br />
This article is intended to give you some idea what&#8217;s involved in a project that&#8217;s simple yet aims to achieve a high quality result.  (A seasoned pro could probably point out a lot of ways in which my result fell short of the high quality mark!)<br />
<br />
In the real world, you need to be able to complete a project of this complexity pretty quickly.  And on a typical film scoring project, you&#8217;d probably want to shoot at least this high from a quality standpoint.  But such projects are often much more complex, involving large numbers of instruments and tracks, sophisticated orchestration, and other complications such as having to match timing to certain events in the picture.  The bottom line is that the aspiring composer for film or other media needs to prepare for some fairly sobering challenges.<br />

Your mission, should you choose to accept it:<br />
<br />
<div><b>Write a one-minute cue&#8212;but the only pitch you can use is C. Any rhythm, any instrumentation, any style, any non-pitch components, etc. that you like. But if there is a pitch played anywhere in the cue, it must be a C.</b></div><div>My point here is this: Most of the composers I've had the privilege to teach have found their greatest strengths to be melody and harmony. It makes sense: we begin our musical learning and development with these aspects (and rhythm, of course, but rhythm is more an inherent function, at least at first).<br />
<br />
So let's strip away the thing we're most familiar with and take a wild ride out to the very edge of our Comfort Zone. Not quite so far out that we're in the Panic Zone&#8212;after all, it's only a minute of music, and there are plenty of ways to create points of access for a listener using other musical elements.</div><div><br />
Your task is to dive into those other elements and come up with a game plan for conveying something meaningful (your choice what that should be)&#8230; and then executing on that plan. This is an assignment I may have mentioned here before on SCOREcast, but now I'm making it (semi-) official.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it comes out&#8230; and if you like this idea, you can give yourself other, similar assignments with different constraints (only duration=whole notes! Only instruments made of wood! No notes in the middle two octaves of the keyboard!).</div><div>Think of it as a musical version of Lars von Trier's <i>The Five Obstructions</i>. Again, we won't play for keeps&#8230; yet. Just for respect. And maybe some fun.</div><div></div><div><div><b>Update:</b></div><div>Well, crap. I intended to post this on the weekend (hence the name). Blame it on pure boneheaded pilot error&#8230; but what the hell. It's up now, and it gives everyone a couple extra days to try out the assignment and see where it takes them.</div><div>Sorry to bump Houston's very good and important article down one slot&#8212;you should go read it <i>right now</i>. Seriously.</div></div></div>

As Jai so aptly put it, schedules can be insane - and James provided sage advice on dynamics and how it can make or break a cue. Combine the demands for high production value with incredibly fast turnaround and the pressure can really mount up as a the deadline approaches.<br />
<br />
I ran into this situation myself when a friend gave me a call on a project a few years ago. He had sold an independent feature to a cable channel, and aside from editorial changes they wanted to make for TV, they also needed a new mix that would fit their broadcast specs. As usual, time was a factor. We had discussed re-scoring some of the music cues, but the schedule was so tight we decided to try and "fix it in the mix" before committing to a larger time line (and budget) that might have added an unnecessary headache. Fortunately, I was able to make some minor tweaks to match my system's sound output to their specified range, and dialed in a mix quickly enough that we could sit back and make some creative decisions on the material that was already there - and got the project turned in (and on air) on time. What made this rabbit-out-of-a-hat gig possible? For me, a big part of it was having a well-designed room, properly calibrated speakers and the controls to turn on a dime.<br />
<br />
Monitors and room acoustics are not all that hip or sexy, but they're as important to getting (and keeping) the gig as the using latest sound library or the making the right industry contacts. Having the ability to quickly produce mixes that can survive intact in broadcast, theaters  and the web is critical to the success of the independent composer's studio. I realized this twenty years ago when I made the transition from study of music composition and theory to electronic music and audio engineering. Fortunately, the tools, technology and resources today are much more advanced (and much cheaper) than they were back then - and even a novice can make noticeable improvements in their mixes with minimal effort. In this article I'll point out a few things that I do to tame the acoustic madness of a one-room studio, and will point out a few resources along the way that you can use to improve your setup.<br />
<br />
First and foremost, a composer has to be honest with him/herself in their ability to be objective about their work. It seems like a silly or trivial thing, but this one decision influences nearly every other decision he/she will make. It's a step in the right direction to realize that your ego can influence your creative decisions, but the serious professional really needs to go further and realize that their ego can also misguide their purchasing decisions, which of course isn't helped but the MI industry. I can't count the number of times that I've walked into another composer's studio and seen monitors that <span style="font-style: italic;">completely </span>out-size the room that they're in. It's almost impossible to create a decent sound from that type of setup - since that person will <span style="font-style: italic;">never </span>be able to run those speakers in their designed power band. So the signal to noise ratio is sub-optimal, the non-linearity in the speakers are more exaggerated - and in the end it's wasted money (and likely mean wasted opportunities for the composer). Likewise, I've seen studios where either windows, artwork or mirrors were wreaking havoc with the sound of the room. Seriously, if you need a big mirror in your studio to see yourself in front of all that cool gear, you're in the business for the wrong reason. Take a picture and use it as a screen-saver, and remove the mirror and artwork and replace it with acoustic treatment. Smooth parallel surfaces in a studio are the black plague of acoustics - and glass and mirrors can be the worst.<br />
<br />
When considering your monitors, the most reasonable approach is to balance the size of your speakers to the size of your room. Instead of blowing a huge wad of dough on a set of gargantuan speakers that have "high client impression factor" take the money saved and spend it on a (relatively inexpensive) second small set of monitors as well as acoustic treatment and calibration equipment. Between my trusty Radio Shack SPL meter and <a href="http://www.behringer.com/en/products/ecm8000.aspx">ECM8000</a> calibration microphone, I have the ability to find out exactly what my room and speakers are <span style="font-style: italic;">and are not</span> producing, and at which levels. I've been using a combination of <a href="http://www.bobgolds.com/Mode/RoomModes.htm">online </a>and freeware utilities to understand the weaknesses of my room, but now there are several pre-calibrated tools that speaker vendors and others have put out on the market to help account for both your room and your speakers. <a href="http://www.ikmultimedia.com/arc/features/">IK Multimedia's ARC</a> is one example of how cutting edge acoustic measurement technology is becoming more accessible. And some manufacturers are now putting compensation utilities right inside the monitor housing.<br />

This is especially important for broadcast and web-destined material, where the range of real-world playback systems can vary widely. One of the nice things about Nuendo is the Control Room function. I can set up multiple monitoring busses that allow the mix to be auditioned across several sets of speakers. In the picture you'll see that I have both a 5.1 system and a stereo speaker set. Nuendo and the SmartAV console not only allows me to switch between them but also control the speakers in a way that lets me quickly isolate problems and check for potential compatibility issues. I can not only downmix a surround buss to stereo, I can also take a stereo mix to mono - and in the case of the 5.1 array I can put that mono signal into the center channel speaker. Anyone that has done a reasonable amount of mixing can tell you that a mono mix check across a phantom stereo field can give strange results, so being able to put it in a single speaker pointed right at the center of your forehead is the best option. And like it or not, television is still largely a mono-compatible medium. It's always a little heartbreaking to listen to a carefully crafted surround mix get stuffed into one tiny speaker - but believe me, it's always better to know what's going to happen to your mix <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">before </span>it gets out into the wild. It isn't ever pretty, but at least you can make the best of it in your environment and find the problems before the producers do.<br />
<br />
So as you can see - there's a lot to know and always more to learn. Aside from going back to school to learn acoustics, there's also a great deal of  expertise available online. There are a myriad audiophile and pro audio discussion forums that cover these topics, and companies like <a href="http://auralex.com/pcf/">Auralex </a>offer free  personalized room analysis and other forms of support. And believe it or not they're not doing it to fill your room with foam and whatnot. They'll help you to find out the exact type and amount of treatment, and where to place it in the room for maximum effect. You'll be surprised how little acoustic treatment it takes to make a huge difference in the sound quality of a rectangular "bread box" shaped room.<br />
<br />
One guerrilla tactic I was taught in school was to use the "mirror method" to deal with the biggest problem in small studios - first reflections. Take that mirror you just moved out of your room and have a friend run it flat along the wall as you sit and watch it from the listening position. If you can see your speakers in the mirror, then that's a place where first reflections will get to you. Put treatment there first. <span style="font-weight: bold;">[Extra credit goes to those readers that have 1) read this far in the article, and 2) figured out that they should <span style="font-style: italic;">also </span>use the mirror method to place treatment on the ceiling of their studio to limit first reflections from there, too.] </span>Figuring out bass trapping is not as straight-forward, but it's also a bit more forgiving. I was about to buy more bass traps for my studio, but I decided to wait until I got my new couch and re-calibrate. As it turned out, the couch (a plush leather love seat) is a great bass trap by itself, so now my studio is more comfortable and sounds better, too. The icing on the cake is that I didn't have to spend any more money on acoustic treatment. The bottom line - be creative and use the resources that are out there. There's a lot more to learn than this article can cover, but the good news is that you don't have to do get a degree in acoustics to make an impact - and you don't have to do it all at once. You can start with a small "project studio kit" and try different placement options with double-sided tape and push pins. Then once you have an arrangement that's to your liking, you can make things more permanent. It may not seem like as much fun as going to the local music shop and blowing a wad of cash on a big set of new speakers, but at the end of the day your music will probably be better for it.<br />
<br />
You've got the right speakers for your space and you've tamed the worst offenses that the room has to offer. That's it, right? Well, not exactly. Now you have to set the levels of your monitors to accurately represent the power level of the music so that you can hear things as accurately as possible. I'll explain by example - say that you are doing a loud rock-styled mix, and your speakers are wailing away with the dial "set to 11". That might be fun for the five minutes before your ears start ringing/hurting/taking damage, but you're actually doing yourself a disservice in more ways than one. Take that mix to a new venue and suddenly the cymbals seem crushed and the bass has lost its punch and heft. What happened? You've just fallen victim to the nature of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contours">equal loudness contours</a>, among other factors. Because the ear varies in sensitivity to high in low ranges across various sound pressure levels, you can be making decisions based on a perception that may not exist when the music is played at an average listening level. In our "loud" example above, the highs and lows get pulled during mixing because the ear perceives them as being louder by comparison to other ranges. The reverse situation can cause the same effect - when monitoring at too low of a level, a cue that's played back "at level" in another venue suddenly has a boomy bass and the high end sizzles like bacon in a frying pan. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It's mix mistakes like this that get a track kicked out of the audition pile and sent to the trash bin.</span><br />
<br />
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-qX4k73vO9I/SoEBx9O9orI/AAAAAAAAAdU/umJ5U8ceoO8/s1600-h/IXL_K-12.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5368574188564882098" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-qX4k73vO9I/SoEBx9O9orI/AAAAAAAAAdU/umJ5U8ceoO8/s200/IXL_K-12.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 200px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 134px;" /></a>So now what? Well there are two more tightly inter-related factors: 1) metering and 2) monitor volume. You have to be sure that what you see in the meters of your DAW actually represent what you're hearing. In most cases composers think that as long as they're managing peaks (and have no red-line "overs" in their mix) that they're OK. Well, as it turns out, peaks are only part of the picture. It's as important to keep an eye on the averages (among a handful of other factors) while you're watching for "overs". Through the years there have been <a href="http://www.shure.com/ProAudio/Products/us_pro_ea_vu">several approaches</a> to deal with measuring power in broadcast audio, and things have progressed quite a bit since the early days of analog meters. One approach that's gaining wider acceptance is <a href="http://www.digido.com/about-us.html">Bob Katz's</a> <a href="http://www.wikirecording.org/K_System">K-System</a> metering, which couples peak and average levels of a signal with a calibrated fixed monitor gain. This makes it fairly close to WYSIWYG mixing, with a few exceptions. This *also* means (which is most important to this article) that when you want to create a mix with more or less dynamic range, all you have to do is make a set adjustment to your meters and a counter-adjustment to the monitor levels and you're ready to rock-and-roll. In my studio, I monitor mostly with the K-20 meter (the widest dynamic range, associated with film-level loudness curves) and then switch over to K-14 or K-12 when producing cues for television or mixing a song. The only counter-adjustment that I have to make on my monitors is to pull the Nuendo Control Room gain down 6 or 8 dB to compensate. This makes sure that the loudest part of the music is always in the same power range, which keeps it right in the C-weighted range of the equal loudness curve, and will translate to the most environments directly without modification.<br />
<br />
Of course there's a lot more to monitor that just the acoustic power of a track. There's frequency, stereo placement, phase, and a host of other things that go into making sure that mix is "right". You'll see in the picture above that the RNDigital Inspector XL multi-meter not only has a level meter, but a spectrogram, and stereo position and correlation meters as well as a few other data points that help you to know what's going on across the mix. You'll notice in the screen shot that the low end is "in the red". It's not producing an "over" on the meters, so I'm relatively "safe" from one perspective. However, if I'm mixing for a broadcast, I might be concerned about how "hot" the signal is in that range, anticipating that it might not come across a set of cheap speakers that can't produce those frequencies.<br />
<br />
This might raise the question "so if you're so good at this, why don't you trust your ears enough to *not* use all this visual information?" Well, it's complicated. For one, the information is presented as discrete aspects of the sound that the ears don't necessarily hear at first pass (and in some cases, at all). It's a way of seeing information before your ears to have a chance to perceive the problem (such as phase correlation that will become a problem when the signal is being mixed to mono) or outright saving your ears from having to listen through so many passes that fatigue begins to affect the perception of the sound. Even at relatively moderate (and calibrated) sound levels can cause a type of burnout that can change mix decisions for the worse. Getting <span style="font-style: italic;">more </span>information while the ears are fresh means that you can make better decisions faster, and save yourself the situation of later having to explain a <span style="font-style: italic;">bad </span>mix even though you've got a<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>good room and monitors. [It has happened to all of us at one time or another.]<br />
<br />
There are lots of options out there, and you'll find as many people that are passionate about <span style="font-style: italic;">their </span>particular monitoring/metering approach as any sampling aficionado is about their favorite sound library. Fortunately, many DAW manufacturers are catching on to the growing baseline of awareness and are putting more "smarts" into the options of their software. So even if you're not a hard-core mixer willing to spend money on a metering plugin (like me) then you'll probably find some <a href="http://www.rndigitallabs.com/Plug-ins/Inspector/inspector.html">freeware </a>options that will do the job for most situations.<br />

Along with the online resources linked throughout this article, you can also pick up a hard copy of Bob Katz's <a href="http://www.digido.com/vmchk/shopping-cart/mastering-audio-by-bob-katz/flypage.tpl.html">Mastering Audio</a> which not only covers an amazing variety of subjects from the most basic to the most esoteric mixing considerations, but also provides solid advice on setting up and calibrating your monitors for master-quality accuracy. While it might seem like a steep hill to climb, the rewards are well worth it - better sounding music in a variety of playback systems, greater flexibility in the studio to set up for a variety of listening situations, and less ear fatigue and the ability to handle longer sessions with little effort. At the end of the day, having the ability to jump right into a project and trusting your speakers, your room and your ears to deliver a broadcast-ready cue is what it's all about.</div>

Plenty! For one thing, we&#8217;<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">ve</span> heard the stories about the money people make licensing their music for television- think about the guy who wrote those 13 &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Wants_to_Be_A_Millionaire">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</a>&#8221; notes. Yes, someone is getting paid for those notes. Why not you? But this article <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">isn</span>&#8217;t about licensing. This article is about making your music well-suited for TV. What makes certain music just right for TV? Is it a particular style of writing? Do certain sound libraries work better than others on TV?<br />
<div><br />
How does sound and music delivered via television differ from sound and music in film? In the context of building and working in a home studio, when I think about sound and music on TV, two main things come to my mind: 1) TV speakers and 2) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression">Compression</a>.</div><div><br />
First, consider your average television. Sure, TV speakers may have come a long way since even 10 years ago, and yes many people have fancy home theatre systems. But think about your mother in law watching her favorite show. Do you think she has the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surround_sound">7.1 Surround</a> cranked up to watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075529/">Love Boat</a> reruns? Mine <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">doesn</span>&#8217;t. The fact is, your average TV- even the ubiquitous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p">Hi-Def</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCD_TV">LCD</a> flat screen models- still come standard with 2 small speakers built in.</div><div><br />
Does your music sound awesome coming through these tiny TV speakers? Have you even tested it out?</div><div><br />
Let me back up a minute. We&#8217;re all familiar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_monitors">studio monitors</a> and how they can help your mix. A best practice I&#8217;<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">ve</span> heard from many composers, producers, recording engineers, etc. is to burn yourself a CD of your favorite music- stuff you know really well and that you think sounds amazing- and take it with you when shopping for monitors. This allows you of course to evaluate the monitor based on music you know well. I propose you do something similar for your own music. Burn your &#8220;TV music&#8221; to a CD, throw it into the DVD player in your living room, and play it through your TV system. Sure, you can listen to it through your huge home theatre system, but you definitely need to also play it through JUST your TV speakers- to hear what your music will sound like to the average folk out in the world.</div><div><br />
Next, with your test CD still in your living room system, compare your music to the stuff you like on TV- just flip back and forth for a while. Or maybe even burn some music from your favorite shows alongside your music on your &#8220;test CD&#8221;. How does it stack up? Tweak accordingly.</div><div><br />
Next, compression. One of my huge lessons learned trying to write music that would sound good on TV is it seemed that my music <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">wasn</span>&#8217;t nearly loud enough, even though I normalized my tracks to 0db. Compression is something I struggle with personally because I&#8217;m a huge fan of classical music, which naturally has a huge dynamic range. So I struggle with compression- but for TV it seems like it almost always has to be done. Ever notice how commercials are louder than the TV shows? They&#8217;re not really- they&#8217;re just compressed out the wazoo, making even the quietest sounds seem almost loud. Theme tunes do this too. A good example is one of my ultimate favorite shows, <a href="http://www.discovery.com/mythbusters"><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">Mythbusters</span></a>. I feel like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning#Pavlov.27s_experiment">Pavlov dog</a> when that theme music plays- it&#8217;s loud on purpose to get my attention, and it works. But even outside of commercials and theme music, TV sound and music must compete with the general ambient noise of wherever people normally have a TV. It&#8217;s not like everyone is watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285331/">24</a> in a hushed theatre (although I&#8217;m sure some would prefer that). Again, tweak accordingly.</div><div><br />
So I&#8217;m throwing this back to you, noble <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">SCOREcasters</span>. We home studio composers would love to hear your tips and tricks for writing music that is well-suited for TV. Some of us may not have the sweet gigs yet but hey, in the meantime, at least we could end up with some killer home videos.</div><br />

<div id='summary4372312439353563971'><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/Sn4OX4qm7YI/AAAAAAAAAKI/ISxEOnkC-H0/s1600-h/sig-ogden.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/Sn4OX4qm7YI/AAAAAAAAAKI/ISxEOnkC-H0/s320/sig-ogden.png" /></a>Traditionally, there have been "unspoken rules" governing what composers should and should not discuss in public forums. Looking back through my posts to the SCOREcast website, I see a theme in my work that suggests I like to break the rules. I guess it is inline with my original idea when I started the podcast back in 2006. I simply wanted to help other people getting into this business understand some of the lessons an independent composer might learn &#8212; both positive and negative &#8212; on this path of self-discovery that we call "scoring films", the ultimate goal being to bring to the forefront some of the issues that we composer types hate to talk about... and start talking about them.<br />
<br />
After three years of doing this, and having now had so many great film music veterans chime in with their thoughts too, I now know for certain that those "unspoken rules" are cold-blooded career killers. There is no doubt about it. The insecurity of the "never let them see you sweat" attitude that pervades the composer culture nowadays is a poison that has been systemic in turning our community into a tiny hive of solitary-confined worker bees.<br />
<br />
Composing, especially the realm of independent composing, has always sort of been a "vacuum" career. You create alone, you hustle alone, you produce alone, you interface alone, you fight to be paid alone, and in the end you celebrate alone or suffer alone, depending on the outcome of all of your former suffering. The good news is that it changes as you ascend up the proverbial ladder, and as you become more successful, the model shifts into more of a team thing where then you are managing (and being managed by) a group of people who are all out for you, and you for them. But until then, it's all you baby!<br />
<br />
So... you're alone. What could be worse than that, right? How about <i>being alone with nothing to work on?</i> Now THAT sucks! The thing is that it's going to happen. It's not matter of "if", it's a matter of "when". At some point, no matter what you do, there are going to be times in your career when you have no projects in sight. It could be right now (maybe you've not worked on anything yet), or maybe you've been somewhat successful in the past and now, all of a sudden, you are facing a drought with no oasis on the horizon. It is during these times that it is hard as a composer for picture to stay motivated. Then you add on the "aloneness" factor, and things can get real dark real fast.<br />
<br />
Often for us... <u><i>Composer + No picture = No motivation to write</i></u>. Therefore, it just stands to reason that... <u><i>Composer + No picture + Nobody = No motivation to go out and get a picture to write to</i></u>. At that point, it's basically Dead Man Walking.<br />
<br />
The concept of the suffering artist is not new. How many times have you heard it said that we all, as artists, "suffer for the sake of art"? The trick is, however, to learn to learn to use the suffering to your benefit, and most of all, to learn to use the suffering to your benefit when it matters most... when there is no project on the horizon &#8212; to stay motivated during the doughts. It sounds silly, but it is so true. There is often no getting around the suffering part, and there is definitely no getting around the drought part either, but just like the literal, real-world version of it, suffering during a drought can lead to death. You have to have the internal fire to get yourself through it and keep forging ahead, in complete faith that the next thing is simply around the next bend.<br />
<br />
I would offer that "motivation" is the internal fire and thus the antidote to "suffering".<br />
<br />
<b>Developing the Disciplne of Self-Motivation</b><br />
People ask me all the time how I stay motivated when there is nothing in the pipeline. How, in a career that is powered solely by my will to get up in the morning and power through, project or no, do I stay excited to do so? The simple answer is this: I've been doing this long enough now that the schedule I keep (lining up my next project at least by the time I'm recording my current one) combined with my love for the craft is a natural motivator. However, the answer nobody wants to hear is that over time I've developed a strict regimen of "motivation maintenance", and I apply it daily in my life. This is something that I've learned out of listening to others that have gone before me... namely my father, Don Ogden, and my amazing manager, Michal Marks. My Pop has given gems of wisdom since I was old enough to retain cognitive memory and my manager is an ass-kicker who never lets me whine for more than 30 seconds about how tough life is. She's always teaching me new ways to get back up on the horse, and my dad taught me to "have" a horse to begin with, so there you have it.<br />
<br />
The truth is that maintaining your motivation to create is actually a long-term journey. The first steps in that journey can be hard, but with discipline and consistency comes the reward of achieving motivation through minimal daily maintenance &#8212; a simple matter of learning to do the right things at the right time.<br />
<br />
We are all different people, made of different levels of "chutzpah", therefore there is going to be a different path to perpetual motivation for me than there is for you. It is going to be up to you to find the path that works best in your life, but I can promise you it will be made of a combination of listening to your gut, knowing your abilities, and learning how to coax, negotiate, and even trick yourself into being creative. Here, then, are some fundamentals that I have learned that will keep you traipsing through the sand during the next project drought that comes your way.<br />
<br />
<b>1) Know Your Targets</b><br />
It's literally impossible to stay motivated if you don't know what you are trying to accomplish. You have to have goals. To me, goals are targets. Targets have to have identities. Name each project. Give it an identity, even if it doesn't come with one already. Treat it like it is a person standing in your studio watching you work. You cannot hit your targets when you don't know what they are.<br />
<br />
<b>2) Realistically Pace Yourself</b><br />
You'll lose interest fast in staying motivated if you fail a lot when you are first trying to develop your creative momentum. Keep your targets small enough that you can hit them with some modicum of regularity, but large enough that you aren't underwhelming yourself creatively. Maybe short films are the way to go in preparation for your first Hollywood feature. Perhaps a web series would be a great starting block if you want to get into TV eventually. These "smaller" targets will help you prepare for the bigger ones waiting for you when you are ready. They aren't going anywhere! Be slow and methodical. Rome wasn't built in a day.<br />
<br />
<b>3) Protect the Nest</b><br />
Your studio is not a place for preparing your taxes, doing your online banking, or researching airline fares for flying home this Christmas. Make your studio a sanctuary of peace, tranquility, and music-making... ONLY. Ask any composer that has had any amount of success doing this and they will tell you, "You need a place specifically set aside to be creative in." After you set yourself up in that creative space, spend time in it daily (or nightly if you are working an additional day job) and make sure you are there at the same time each day. After awhile, you'll start achieving creative success in that space, and once you do, your brain will start associating creative success with <i>that</i> space. The next thing that will happen is you will only be able to be "creative" there, and your studio will become a power-center in your life. <br />
<br />
This is not some weird-ass cosmic thing I'm talking about here... so don't flip out and think I'm from Satan! I'm simply talking about using your studio as a place of creative power rather than another room in your house, or a space in a rental facility... a "necessary expense" to keeping your career moving. Your studio is much more than that. When I go in every day to the Musicave, my brain clicks into "create" mode, because that is all I've ever allowed my studio to be - a creative "laboratory" for my musical science experiments.<br />
<br />
<b>4) Give It Time, but Don't Give It Up</b><br />
If you encounter a situation that seems insurmountable, give it a day or two if you have it to give, but do not give up and just lay down and die to it. No problem (and certainly no project) is ever truly insurmountable. Put problems and obstacles away for a second, but always come back and work on them later. Often times, you'll have more info by then, a better perspective by then, and a better idea of what to try that might be the catalyst for a breakthrough. My dad always taught me that "Everything is always better after a good night's sleep." He is right. Take a break, take a nap, take a vacation if you have that kind of time... but never ever take the easy way out by quitting or giving up. Quitting is not characteristic of a winner, and to be successful in the film music biz being a winner is Film Composer 101.<br />
<b><br />
5) Identify Your "Power Band"</b><br />
I hear my partner in crime Lee Sanders talk about this concept all the time. Each of us has a time of day where we are most creative. Just like your body needs to sleep at certain times and eat at certain times, your brain also needs to be creative at certain times.<br />
<br />
Your brain has a creative "power band" and (unfortunately, an uncreative one, as well). My power band is in the wee hours of the morning, between the hours of 4 and 9AM. When everyone in my house is asleep, I seem to get the majority of my creative work finished. <br />
<br />
I realize that the majority of composers reading this will disagree and say that their "power band" is at night and maybe even into the wee hours of night - completely opposite from me, and that's totally cool. It's whatever you know it to be. And... it could change as you grow. My creative time used to be at night when I was in my early twenties, and even still I have to pull the occasional all-nighter to get something delivered on time. But whether it is early morning, late night, or in the middle of the day after you eat a healthy lunch, you need to find and identify what time of day your brain is at its most creative, and then make it a point to create during that time. Reserve the least creative time of the day to do the things that you know even a monkey could do, but need to be done, nonetheless.<br />
<br />
<b>6) Use the Right Tools</b><br />
Have you ever tried to use a butter knife as a Phillips head screw driver? C'mon! Yes you have! We all have. It seems like it would work, but it doesn't work so well. That's because in order to turn a Phillips head screw, you need a Phillips head screw driver. That type of fastener was simply made to be used with the right tool.<br />
<br />
I observed this in action repeatedly by watching my father and my grandfather work together in our family's floor covering business. It never really hit home with me, however, until the day my father bought me my first professional drum set. After laying out over $4,000 of wages earned by crawling around on his hands and knees laying carpet in strangers' homes, he looked at me with tears in his eyes and said, "To be great, son, it helps to have the right tools."<br />
<br />
That lesson has stayed with me since, and after years of writing and playing music while using the tools of the trade that we all use, I cannot stress enough how true that really is. Working with the right gear makes all the difference. Conversely, working with inferior gear causes pain and heartache, and ultimately, when the stakes are critical, it will cost you jobs. You simply cannot afford to scrimp on your studio or your instruments. I have been a professional studio drummer for 30 years, and I've played about every manufacturer's drums that can be played. I'm not lying when I tell you that playing a custom-made and hand-crafted kit is so much easier and musical than playing a cheap assembly-line kit that anyone can buy at the local Walmart. I bet Tiger Woods would agree that playing with the best-made clubs he can find makes "thinking" about his game way easier.<br />
<br />
When you don't have to worry about your tools, you are free to worry about the stuff that matters. Don't cut corners here. Buy the best you can afford. Always.<br />
<br />
<b>7) Monitor Your Progress</b><br />
I know people who cannot wait to wake up, log into IMDb Pro, and see if their "Star Meter" increased while they were sleeping. True story.<br />
<br />
While it might seem a little bit self-absorbed, I understand their excitement to a certain degree. Monitoring your progress can be excellent motivation to either do better, or keep doing what you are doing. Either way, stop and self-evaluate every once in awhile. Nothing but good can come from it, and since nobody loves you enough to *really* tell you the truth anyway (American Idol much?), why the hell not?<br />
<br />
<b>8) Get Out in the World</b><br />
While your nest will serve as your creative space, the world can serve as your "inluential" one. I'm a tea drinker, so many times I've set up shop in my local Coffee Bean to work on the more mundane tasks that our job demands &#8212; emails, invoices, payroll, website development, SCOREcast article writing... Just kidding! The Coffee Bean might not be as cozy and "cocoon-ish" as the Musicave is for me, but it provides an atmosphere that effects me differently than the Musicave does, and allows me to be influenced by things that will eventually find their way into music. Remember that we are responsible for supporting dramatic emotion in a musical way that every human hopefully can relate to. If we don't surround ourselves with humans every once in awhile, we'll almost certainly lose touch with the reality of human emotion and behavior, and then our music could become dry and empty.<br />
<br />
<b>9) Pay Attention to Your Peers</b><br />
It is often helpful to listen to the work of others and pay attention to what others are up to. However, proceed with caution here... I ONLY do this to make sure that...<br />
<u><i><br />
</i></u>&nbsp;#1) <u><i>I'm not reinventing the wheel.</i></u> Why do stuff your way when someone else has found a more efficient way to accomplish the exact same thing? That's not innovative, that's just plain stupid.<br />
<br />
#2) <u><i>My work is up to industry standards.</i></u> You cannot turn in mediocre mixes, tracks with artifacts in them, or stems that are in the wrong formats and resolutions because industry standard delivery specifications have been established that will not tolerate those things. Find out what the standards are and either adopt them, or go one step further and make yours a level better.<br />
<br />
The reason I say to only pay attention to others in these two instances is because if you constantly watch what everyone else is doing, then sooner or later you snap out of it and realize that only THEY have gotten music written while you have been standing there like a dumbass drooling over their accomplishments! You haven't done a thing! <br />
<br />
So, be careful... keep your finger on the pulse of the industry, but don't get so interested that you lose time.<br />
<br />
<b>10) Do It Anyway</b><br />
My manager constantly tells me this, and she is so right on: When you don't feel like writing, <i>write anyway.</i>&nbsp; Force yourself to write. I mean, look... it's what we do. We. Write. Music. <br />
<br />
At first, it will seem awkward, clumsy, forced, and futile to just write when you feel you have nothing to write. After awhile though, you will start to feel your groove returning. You might still think what you are producing is the biggest bunch of noise in the world, but honestly... when you are in a funk, you aren't the best judge of your output anyway, so who the hell are you to say what is good when you think everything in life sucks at the moment? Do you see how silly that is?<br />
<br />
My manager says when you feel blue, write it. When you are happy, write THAT. When you are angry, write THAT. When you are scared, write THAT TOO! Just write. Just start doing it. Nine times out of ten, your creativity will come rushing in and you'll have three more cues in your library by the end of the day. Your momentum will return and you are back on that horse!<br />
<br />
And believe me, that horse (life!) will do everything it can to buck you off again... but maybe next time you'll have the right tools to know what do.<br />
<br />

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">Is this over the line? Too much bravado with too little balance?

<br />
In case you aren't familiar with his work, Hughes was responsible for writing and directing some of the greatest staple teen dramedy films of the 1980's including "<a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088128/" rel="imdb" title="Sixteen Candles">Sixteen Candles</a>", "<a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088847/" rel="imdb" title="The Breakfast Club">The Breakfast Club</a>", and "<a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091042/" rel="imdb" title="Ferris Bueller's Day Off">Ferris Bueller's Day Off</a>". He also wrote and directed several cinematic classics like "Trains, Planes, and Automobiles", "<a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098554/" rel="imdb" title="Uncle Buck">Uncle Buck</a>", and "<a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090305/" rel="imdb" title="Weird Science (film)">Weird Science</a>".<br />
<br />
Hughes' films often contained eclectic scores by <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ira_Newborn" rel="wikipedia" title="Ira Newborn">Ira Newborn</a> mixed with excellent while obscure source material, the most memorable probably being the synth-poppy "Bueller", which combined Newborn's synth prowess with the then unknown German punk-electro band "Yello" and emerging talents like "Dream Academy", "<a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flowerpot_Men" rel="wikipedia" title="The Flowerpot Men">The Flowerpot Men</a>", and "The English Beat".<br />
<br />
It sucks to say goodbye to a talent that will be sorely missed in my own home to a pretty great extent. Every year when I go back to Oregon for Christmas, my mother and I watch "Uncle Buck" together and still laugh ourselves stupid. It was just one of those films that came out during a time when her and I really could use the laughter. We did, and still do. ("Ever hear of a ritual killing?") :op<br />
<br />
Rest in Peace, John Hughes. I look forward to seeing the picture that you and <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001006/" rel="imdb" title="John Candy">John Candy</a> are surely starting tomorrow morning at the big Shermer High in the sky.<br />

This indiscriminate battle cry was practically nonexistent during the first hundred years of film music. Today, it's a word carrying a vulgar weight amongst filmmakers and audiences alike.<br />
<br />
This is the new evil feared amongst the collective patrons of the film industry, the scarlet letter nobody wants to see branded, and the dreaded angel-of-death for all <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score" rel="wikipedia" title="Film score">film scores</a> of worth. At the mere hint of it, filmmakers raise their crossed-fingered hands as if warding off the demon seed of Satan himself.<br />
<br />
It has left me flummoxed, perplexed, and downright nonplussed.<br />
<br />
What is this new "four-letter-word?"<br />
<br />
...<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">manipulative</span></span>.<br />
<br />
A quick Google search yields the following quotes...<br />
<br />
<blockquote><ul><li>"They don't need manipulative music to express their emotions."</li>
<li>"He's said that older film music is manipulative, like a commercial, with the music telling you how to feel, like propaganda..."</li>
<li>"The movie is shamelessly manipulative from start to finish..."</li>
</ul></blockquote><br />
Balderdash!<br />
<br />
Not only is <span style="font-style: italic;">manipulation</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">manipulative music</span> something that should not be feared, on the contrary, it should be embraced! Why?<br />
<br />
For starters, it is the very essence surrounding the function of film music. Telling a story through the use of moving images is an awkward and obstacle-ridden medium. The great challenge which lies in expressing a narrative through film is that the storytellers can not be content with mere observation of their work. As an audience you can't simply sit in a theater and observe a film. That's not good enough. That's not why we love movies. It's not enough to merely observe the film, we have to experience it! We have to live it. We have to feel everything the characters are feeling even though it may be unrealistic for an audience to relate to them. We have to invest our emotional fortitude into their triumphs and equally empathize with their tribulations. This is essential and none of it achieved without careful and prescribed manipulation.<br />
<br />
That's the very nature of cinema. To ask of your audience a degree of personal investment attained through artificial means. This is called manipulation.<br />
<br />
When you're watching THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (1995), are you naturally going to relate to hardened criminals sentenced to a lifetime of captivity for their evil crimes? The average moviegoer will not have the faculties to come close to comprehending this experience. Yet, <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f80000000001e1b46" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002353/" rel="imdb" title="Thomas Newman">Thomas Newman</a>'s exquisite score manipulates and guides our emotional stream of unconsciousness in a way that would not be possible without it. When those convicts drink their beer on the "second-to-last day on the job" feeling like "lords of all creation," we can relate on such an infinitely profound level of intimacy.<br />
<br />
Thank you, Mr. Newman for manipulating me.<br />

This will not happen without <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f8000000000121aae" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002354/" rel="imdb" title="John Williams">John Williams</a>' vehemently powerful score commanding you to do so.<br />

When you're watching GLORY (1986), are you naturally going to feel the overwhelming sense of pride and honor each soldier of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry feels when they storm Fort Wagner? <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f800000000025f5be" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000035/" rel="imdb" title="James Horner">James Horner</a>'s devinely inspired score manipulates us into feeling such things whereas otherwise we'd be left abandoned to feel far more natural emotions in these situations like fear, anxiety, or sympathy.<br />

<br />
Granted music is not the only form of manipulation found in cinema. It is the sole job of every contributor to a film, be it costume designer, cinematographer, writer, director, effects artist, make-up artist, sound designer, etc. to craft their magic for the sole purpose of audience manipulation.<br />
<br />
This is why I love movies so much. The good ones literally command me to dream, to feel, to aspire, and to inspire. Such unscrupulous control stems from effective music ranging from the explosively robust, to the subtlety fragile.<br />
<br />
Opponents of this decree sometimes declare that it's okay to be manipulated as long as you don't know you're being manipulated. Really? Then why go to movies? If you enjoy a movie, you're being manipulated.<br />
<br />
Perhaps when people use the term "manipulative" in a negative context they really mean "inappropriate?" Maybe. That makes far more sense. Inappropriate music or non-functional music can certainly destroy any intimacy built within the cinematic experience. This knowledge is nearly as old as film music itself. I don't believe, however, that's the intention behind the use of the word.<br />
<br />
The truth is good scores are manipulative scores and good films are manipulative films. I wouldn't want it any other way. <br />
<br />
Manipulate me, please!</div>

<div id='summary8633183540408117532'><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SpFJKQ07vNI/AAAAAAAAAj0/-4A2lRZJMNE/s1600-h/meghan-laundry.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/SpFJKQ07vNI/AAAAAAAAAj0/-4A2lRZJMNE/s320/meghan-laundry.png" /></a></div>It is pretty daunting to look at the TV landscape and the people who are already involved with scoring for television and ask yourself: How in the hell am I ever going to get a shot? So many shows are in production, not to mention the fact that television is not just about the "regular season" anymore &#8212; it's about a fragmented "season" that now runs year-round. The "Big Three" networks are now starting to show the signs of a marathon runner trying desperately to keep up with the young bucks that are also on the course. These "youngins" are starting to become directly responsible for some of the best drama and comedy on television, with second and third-tier premium cable leading the pack with content that cannot be shown in a regular primetime slot.<br />
<br />
With all of these variables at play in the current TV landscape, and given the fact that most people would still rather recline in the comfort of their own living room than brave cellphones, babies, and teenagers with laser pointers in a theater setting, TV is 2.0 these days.<br />
<br />
As a film composer, you might be wondering how to tap into this luxurious stream, and how to start looking for TV gigs today in the crowded river of television composers?<br />
<br />
Well... Not so fast. TV is pretty different from what you might be used to.<br />
<b> </b><br />
<b>#1) TV is <i>not</i> film.</b><br />
Scoring for television is nothing like scoring for film. Not in the least bit. There are some similarities, but not many. First, the schedules on television shows are insane. The hours you have to put in are completely inhumane. A typical season might stretch from September to May, literally with no break, and your weekly schedule often doesn't allow for any downtime during score production. If you are used to hanging out with your family on weekends, keeping your composing time as "banker's hours" during the week, you probably aren't cut out for television. The truth hurts.<br />
<br />
<b>#2) TV is <i>not</i> cheap.</b><br />
No... by "cheap" I do not mean your cable bill should be less than $30 a month! What I mean here is that television is very transparent. Because of the shorter runtimes that TV shows naturally have to cater to, music is often looked at to carry more of the story than it would during a 90-minute film. In addition, HD and <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_cable" rel="wikipedia" title="Digital cable">digital cable</a> have upped the ante in regards to audio resolution, and now, even people with hearing issues can hear their favorite shows - and everything in them -  better than they've ever have been able to before. Bottomline... your music has to be amazing. Television is no place to cut corners, skimp on audio quality, or rest on your laurels by using a quick and dirty methodology of loops and patches. You have to put time, attention, and detail into it or you are simply eventually going to get that call that nobody ever wants to get.<br />
<br />
<b>#3) TV is <i>not</i> for egomaniacs.</b><br />
Most of us are probably not at this level yet, but with film there comes a certain level of opinionated ego that you can get away with, and frankly, that most producers and directors who are worth their salt will even invite. After all, why would they have hired you in the first place if not for your musical opinion? Conversely, in television, you are rarely working with a director, as their job is finished once principal photography wraps. Instead, you are joined at the hip with either the producers or the "<a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_runner" rel="wikipedia" title="Show runner">showrunner</a>" &#8212; that person possibly being anyone that the producers deems responsible enough to handle the show and all of its components. There are bound to be lots of changes, suggestions, requests, demands, and mandates from the showrunner, because they are responsible to the studio to bring quality and consistency week after week. The pressure is really on them, therefore everyone on their team must perform at an optimum level. There is no room for you to allow your feelings to be hurt over someone on the creative team demanding that you make a change or rewrite a cue to fit the scene differently than you had first interpreted. The time constraints often do not allow for any other communication style other than directness, and you must have the kind of thick skin that can tolerate that.<br />
<br />
<b>#4) TV is <i>not</i> for the uneducated.</b><br />
This last point is two-fold. The first part is appropriate for everyone working in TV or film, but I'll relate it to TV in this way: If you want to work in television, you have to know what <span style="font-style: italic;">works</span> in television. If you have no idea what has come before you, how can you compete? A case could be made that you can be more original and have a fresher perspective if you are naive to what has been done before, therefore possessing zero knowledge of the limitations imposed by history. However, in television, some things just do <span style="font-style: italic;">not work</span>. Again, often because of the medium, if you think like a film composer while scoring a <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_program" rel="wikipedia" title="Television program">TV show</a>, you are going to get yourself into some serious trouble at some point. Very often, motifs and themes that you would develop over time on a film will not work on a TV show because again... there isn't enough time. Similarly, since you are working within an episodic framework, you have to remember that you are relatively blind to what is coming from week to week. Therefore, your anticipatory skills need to be razor sharp. I'm probably not being clear enough here, but there are just certain "rules" by which TV works. Breaking them is certain death, and any showrunner will agree.<br />
<br />
The second part of my point here is that when I say "you cannot be uneducated if you want to work in TV", I mean that you... wait for it... need to watch TV! If you aren't a fan of TV or if you are one of those who hasn't seen a dramatic television show since the 1960's, forget it. You + TV writing = FAIL. Period. TV is a medium that has captivated audiences since 1929, so it has had a lot of practice at getting certain things right. If you do not watch TV, then you do not know what works on TV. TV has changed over the years, and you have to keep up on trends, current sounds, dramatic chops, just like film or video <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game" rel="wikipedia" title="Video game">games</a> or any other medium that you might want to write for. Not everyone can cut the mustard in television. Many people try, and many people die. Be a fan, get on the bus, and start studying. There is no other way. Learn by immersion.<br />
<br />
<b>What's the Point?</b><br />
I want to end this by telling you that my experience with all this is highly subjective. I have never scored a TV show in my life. On the other hand, I have been on teams that have scored <span style="font-style: italic;">plenty</span>. I've written additional music for TV and have had my music placed in dozens of primetime TV shows. I've seen it done over and over and over and over again as an assistant to several great TV writers. I've watched and I've learned so that when the time comes for me, I can have somewhat of an idea of what I should be doing. I know I'll still be scared to death, but I will have the procedure down in a way that maybe others haven't had the chance to observe. I hope that you get the same out of my little diatribe here.<br />
<br />
Talk to me, SCOREcast! Let me know in the COMMENTS what you are thinking about this. Are you scared of TV? Are you excited to write for this medium? What about television seems foggy or unsure to you as you contemplate launching in? Let's talk it out!<br />

Can you believe August is here already? For me at least, this year is flying by at pretty heavy duty rate of exchange and lately it's been hard to see the numbers that seem to be a blur on my calendar. As summer comes to a close and we anticipate all that comes with the transition into the final season of the year &#8212; school starting, cooler weather, our favorite sports teams back in action, etc. &#8212; there is always one thing that I look forward to: The Fall TV Season.<br />
<br />
Officially, Fall TV kicks off during the week of September 20, but around here at SCOREcast, it began about a month ago. Add to that the fact that many alternate networks are debuting shows out of the regular season grid to compete with the Big 4, and you have one gigantic and confusing slate of programming hitting all at once.<br />
<br />
As Lee likes to say, several of us are "deep in it" on various projects for TV, and so he and I thought that now would be a great time to talk a little about the process of scoring for television. Almost every one of our SCOREcast Featured Contributors has worked at some level in television, so I'm looking forward to the stories and wisdom that comes with experience. <a href="2009/08/tv-then-and-now.html">Scott Stambler's column</a> kicked off the month's theme in a great way this morning, so if you haven't read it yet, check it out.<br />
<br />
Also, watch for everyone's commentary on some of our favorite TV scores in a series we'll run all month called "TV Scores That Work".<br />
<br />
As always, weigh in on the COMMENTS and let us know what you are thinking with each post... It's the conversation that we all live for, so join in and don't be shy!<br />

At take 282 <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=2338142&amp;l=af8f6852cc&amp;id=631393172">Rick Marvin</a>, our composer, wondered how many takes we would accumulate by the time we finished our fifth session on the day this article posts. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=2339640&amp;l=d2903f2a9f&amp;id=631393172">Vinny &#8220;Smart Water&#8221; Cirilli</a>, our Protools Recordist, and software virtuoso of <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/vcirilli/CueChronicle/">CueChronicle</a>  said, &#8220;I wonder how many takes "<a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096697/" rel="imdb" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>" are up to?&#8221; We found out that &#8220;The Simpsons&#8221;, which had scored mostly at Fox, was at the take thirty thousand mark.<br />
<br />
Funny thing is, up until a couple of months ago I had no idea most T.V. shows were scored in the box - that&#8217;s how long it&#8217;s been since I worked in TV. In my day everything was scored with an orchestra of about thirty players. I started in T.V. and we scored five shows a week, every week. I&#8217;m aware of what a composer can achieve from today&#8217;s synth studio, but I still feel badly for the thousands of sessions lost to the incredible <a href="http://www.afm.org/locals/info/number/47">Local 47</a> musicians. In this regard I don&#8217;t think technology is our friend. I asked a session player friend to comment on this and they were reluctant to do so. I understand the reasons.<br />
<br />
Are today&#8217;s T.V. scores better then they were in my day? I don&#8217;t know the answer to that. I can tell you that the composers I worked with wrote to timing notes which detailed everything that happened in the particular picture sequences they were writing. This forced the composer to hit their &#8216;anchor points&#8217; of dialogue and cuts. Funny how you don&#8217;t see much of that these days even though the composer has digital picture. The go-to book in my day was called &#8220;Scoring For Films&#8221; by the composer <a href="http://www.earlehagen.net/">Earle Hagen</a>.  If you&#8217;re studying composition it might be worth a look see. Another interesting film music book from 'the old days" is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=7ozTus2HZbsC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Film+music++By+Roy+M.+Prendergast#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">Film Music by Roy Prendergast.</a> I included this link because it detailed the kind of work we did as music editors. That illustration is a bar breakdown chart, where you can see the timings of the action and the cuts above the written music.<br />
<br />
Another concept worth noting are today&#8217;s main titles vs the classic main titles. Check it out. I would love to hear your feedback on what makes a great Main Title. I still love the themes I can remember. It always made the show a bit more fun and exciting to watch, but that's my take. It just takes mentioning "The Love Boat", "<a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057751/" rel="imdb" title="Gilligan's Island">Gilligan's Island</a>", or "Hill St. Blues" and you have that tune in your head. Am I right? For me, that's the stuff great main titles contain. What are your favorites?<br />

<div class="MsoNormal">I&#8217;m going to dive in straightaway in this month's column with a handful of advice for those of us that have to mockup our music (i.e., all of us).</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">LEARN YOUR SAMPLE LIBRARIES</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The simplest way to do this is just working on a project.  If you don&#8217;t have a big one on the table, make some exercises or write some library music- get to know the strengths and weaknesses of your samples, and their unique characteristics.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Is there reverb on the sample?  If it is nice reverb, perhaps you can leave it in or match your other samples using similar reverb settings.  If not, can you alter the release or decay section of the Amplitude Envelope to minimize the reverb?  (See basic analog synthesis for an explanation of this one)</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">How is it recorded?  Close mic&#8217;ed in an anechoic chamber?  Or from a distance in a large hall?  You can match the sound of different spaces through gently cutting certain frequencies (often by using a low cut or a narrow dip at 1.5kHz).</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Is there phasing on the sample? (Yes&#8230; a certain library that rhymes with &#8216;Sienna&#8217; is notorious for poor recordings)  Perhaps you can alter the phase and use some EQ to fix this.  If not, just move on to the next.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Which samples have long attack?  Short attack?  Can these be altered?  Which samples are good for staccato?  Spiccato?  Detache?  Etc.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The goal here is efficiency- not only how good your mockup will sound but how fast you&#8217;ll get it there.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE GREAT DEBATE - EXPRESSION vs. VOLUME</span></span></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Essentially, these 2 parameters do the same thing.  However, volume is notorious for causing craziness in your DAW.  Ever write volume automation to a midi region and then try riding the track&#8217;s volume automation?  Then you know what I mean- things get messy really quickly!</span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">For simplicity&#8217;s sake, many will use expression to shape phrasing and the volume of an instrument from note to note.  Volume will be used to make greater adjustments from section to section, or may not be used at all.  Often, you can use a short volume ride to help and instrument go to &#8220;11&#8221; when you need it.</span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">ON THAT NOTE&#8230;</span></span></span></span></span><br />
Write in default expression and volume parameters into each track of your template at bar 0 (or earlier). Give yourself plenty of headroom so you don&#8217;t overload the master bus.  Try keeping the volume at 0db (usually 100 in midi terms) and start with an expression value of 64.  This way, each track you work on will have a similar dynamic level and range, avoiding time consuming re-mixing later in your workflow.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">BEYOND VOLUME AND EXPRESSION</span><br />
Here is where you can really do some damage, in a good way!  A few things you can do to really get expressive with your sounds-<br />
<br />
- Rather than using velocity to switch between samples (i.e. soft, medium, and loud), use a continuous controller like the modulation wheel (cc1) to crossfade between them.  This is fairly easy to set up in Vienna Instruments, a little bit more difficult in EXS and Kontakt- but still fairly straightforward and well worth your time.  So rather than guessing how hard your finger is hitting the keyboard and fixing your velocities later in the piano roll editor, you can instead have a smooth transition between samples while pounding on the piano however your fists like.<br />
<br />
You can also use this same parameter to do other cool stuff.  For instance, not only does my mod wheel control the velocity crossfade of my Vienna sample, but the legato sample changes to a portamento sample when the mod wheel is fully up (value of 127).  You can have a lot of fun (not to mention create some cool sounds!) by controlling several parameters from one fader.<br />
<br />
- Use another fader in your setup to control the filter a.k.a. &#8220;brightness.&#8221;  The default midi controller value for this is 74.  So I set a fader on my keyboard to midi controller number 74 and set up my samples to *gently* open and close a low pass filter with this parameter.<br />
<br />
Allow me to explain- first get the sound of a trumpet in your head.  Now, imagine it playing loud- it is piercing, bright.  Imagine it playing softly- it is now mellow and a bit darker.  Sometimes our sample libraries have a hard time sampling this many layers.  I&#8217;m very often disappointed with the soft samples, and use a filter to add some extra expressiveness to my mockups.<br />
<br />
-Use yet another fader in your setup to control sample start (very easy to do in EXS!).  This could be any controller number, so just pick one.  This will add variety to libraries that might otherwise be very bland.  For instance- by starting a sample later than the default beginning, you can avoid the &#8220;machine gun&#8221; effect.  If your trumpet sample starts with the same sharp attack each time, you can use this to vary it up.<br />
<br />
This will also create much more depth in string samples because instead of every note starting at the same exact place (same attack, same color, etc.) you now have can have a slightly different sound for the beginning of each note.  Don&#8217;t go crazy with this one, but use it when necessary.<br />
<br />
Depending on the type of sample your are working with, you may have to attach this parameter to the Attack portion of the Amplitude Envelope- just ever so slightly though!<br />
<br />
-Try alternative controllers to faders.  For instance, the drum pads on my M-Audio Axiom keyboard actually have aftertouch (!) and can be assigned to any continuous midi controller.  So not only can I move faders to get what I want, but I can gently move my finger up and down on these pads to get a different quality of expression.  Ribbon and breath controllers can be fun too!<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">BEER AND PIZZA</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Tried to catch you off guard with that one!  This pertains to bringing over your close musician friends in exchange for food when you are low on funds.  &#8220;Sweetening&#8221; refers to mixing in a soloist or small group of musicians to an otherwise all-synth track.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">You should be careful not to get tempted into mixing a live player in too hot- when done right, they can blend right into your real instruments and add that certain &#8216;je ne sais qua&#8217; that you are looking for.  Maybe it&#8217;s the breathing, the space between the notes, or the gentle imperfections, but just one live player can bring your whole track to life!</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">However, precautions must be taken.  Nothing sounds worse than a live player on top of terrible samples, a shabby mix or reverb, or a poorly programmer mockup.  They will stick out like a sore thumb.  I can&#8217;t emphasize this enough- spend plenty of time listening to REAL, LIVING PERFORMERS- in concerts, on CD, online, however you can- and imitating their mannerisms through your work as a synth programmer.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">QUANTIZE LESS, PRACTICE MORE</span></span></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I think my students at UCLA might mutter this in their sleep.  This is my mantra!  There is no greater mockup killer than extreme or inappropriate quantization.  On the other hand, there is no greater mockup enhancer than a well played, expressive solo that is right in the pocket!  Find the &#8216;groove&#8217; and practice before you hit record.  If you can&#8217;t get a good expressive performance out of yourself, you won&#8217;t have any idea how to get it out of your live musicians.  Even if it is one short phrase at a time, recorded at half time- get the MUSIC down right and then hit record!  And don&#8217;t kill it with too much quantization.</span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Alright junior Zimmers&#8230; have fun out there!</span></span></span></span></div></div>
