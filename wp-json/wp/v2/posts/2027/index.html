This time, we will delve a bit into the technical background of creating a template. There are some ways in which a template can be set up, each of them more suited to a particular workflow and situation. But don\u2019t worry &#8211; it won\u2019t get too technical \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>In a nutshell, there are two general ways of hosting a template:<\/p>\n<p>1) Inside the sequencer<\/p>\n<p>2) Outside the sequencer (go figure!)<\/p>\n<p>Hosting your template inside your sequencer mainly has the advantage of being easy to set up by not requiring any additional software or even hardware. Such a template works much the same way as a regular project you are working on. You load the sequencer file and are good to go. The settings of the template (the instruments loaded into it as well as for example CC values) are unique to this project and are automatically present when opening the file. Sounds good, doesn\u2019t it? It _is_ good, but there\u2019s more!<\/p>\n<p>Here is where a template outside of your sequencer comes into play. Having your sequencer just play host to all those tracks, but not actually process the instruments has a number of key advantages:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; The sequencer just stores MIDI data and possibly audio data (if you use recordings\/loops\u2026). This keeps it mean and lean and usually results in a much snappier user experience.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; If multiple projects use the same (or more or less the same) set of samples, you can use the same template. This means that when switching between projects, the samples can stay loaded and you only need to load the (small) project file into the sequencer.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; If you are using a 64bit host, hosting plugins externally allows you (depending on the method used) to use 32bit plugins \u201einside\u201c 64bit projects without resorting to a bit bridge, which tend to be notoriously unstable.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Plain and simple, some instruments simply work better in an external host. Sounds weird, but it\u2019s the truth.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Last but not least, externally hosted instruments can also mean externally hosted as in \u201eon a different machine\u201c. As you will see (or probably already know), this is dead easy. If set up right, there is no visible or audible difference between instruments hosted on your DAW and instruments hosted on another machine.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Technical Requirements<\/h2>\n<p>Before having a look at the various methods of creating an externally hosted template, lets briefly look at some of the technical aspects. Like with most software applications, a template requires CPU power and lots of RAM as well as fast storage. All this also applies to running individual virtual instruments, but in the case of templates it is much more pronounced.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Memory (RAM):<\/strong> As discussed in part I, a template contains all the instruments\/articulations you commonly use, quite often multiple patches with the same articulations from different libraries. In any given piece, you will end up just using a subset of all that is there. Even though it is possible to largely purge the unused samples from memory, all these instruments still need a sizable amount of RAM to stay loaded. For creating a template, having as much physical (!) memory as possible is a must. For a small orchestral template, figure in at least 16GB. That will leave a bit of headroom for the sequencer and Operating System. 32 GB is pretty decent and 64GB will allow you to host a pretty large template on a single machine. While speed is important, size is more. You will not see a huge difference between RAM clocking at 1600 MHz or 1800 MHz. But you will feel the difference between 24 and 32 GB!<\/li>\n<li><strong>CPU:<\/strong> Most sample-based instruments use scripting for producing the sound you want to hear. That means that every time you play a patch, some CPU cycles will be used for calculations inside the script. Fortunately, almost all libraries are programmed relatively well so that CPU time is only used when the instrument is actually doing something. Unless you happen to use one of the rare exceptions or use VIs that use CPU power all the time, your CPU load should not be much higher than on regular projects even with a large template. Figure in some additional CPU load for the hosting software, but all in all CPU cycles will be the least of your problems.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> With rare exceptions, sampled instruments only load a small part of the full sample into the system memory. The rest is streamed from disk while playing. This small part at the beginning, called the preload buffer, serves to give the sampler something to play while it is loading the rest of the sample when needed. How well this process works largely depends on how fast your drive is able to read the rest of the file. If it is not fast enough, you will hear clicks, pops or missing notes. If that happens, the preload buffer needs to be increased. If you have a very fast drive, you can lower the preload buffer greatly. So, in a nutshell: The faster your drives are, the less data you need to load into memory and the more instruments can you load in total. That means that while drive speed is about as important as it is with regular projects, your template will nevertheless benefit greatly from fast drives. Obviously SSDs are best, but expensive.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Network:<\/strong> Should you wish to host parts of your template on another machine or even multiple machines, depending on the method used you will need additional hardware. If both MIDI data to the template and audio data back to your sequencer are handled via LAN, you will need an ethernet cable to connect the machines. If you have more than one slave machine, use a switch to connect. If you also need to get audio back separately to the sequencer, you might also need an additional audio interface. Make sure all network cards involved support gigabit speed. Also use compatible Cat5 or Cat6 cables. There is very little you can do wrong here, fortunately. Sometimes onboard network chips have issues like constant crackles or pops. If that happens to you, simply get a dedicated network card.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>External Setups<\/h2>\n<p>When setting up a template where the instruments are hosted outside your sequencer, there are four different setup styles. Each way to set things up has advantages (+) and disadvantages (-). Usually one template will mix these approaches depending on the nature of the instruments to set up:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hosting instruments\/patches outside the sequencer: What you do here is have as many instruments as possible running outside the sequencer. MIDI gets sent to the instrument, its audio comes back. Very easy and straightforward.\n<p>+ Easy to set up, everything inside your sequencer feels as usual, no changes in workflow<br \/>\n&#8211; Requires a lot of audio tracks going back into the sequencer, thus very heavy on the network when using slaves<\/li>\n<li>Like 1, but with grouped audio channels: Instead of having each instrument\u2019s audio going back to the sequencer separately, you can group instruments together. This may be on a smaller scale like all Flute patches together, or much broader, for example all high woodwinds. Primarily it depends on how similar the instruments are in usability and how much your connection can still handle.\n<p>+ Saves a lot of audio tracks, lets you adjust whole instruments quickly.<br \/>\n&#8211; Individual instruments can not be processed separately. Make sure to only combine instruments that will receive the same post-processing.<\/li>\n<li>Post-processing outside the sequencer: Instead of getting the direct plugin audio back on single tracks (1) or grouped (2), especially for large templates it can make sense to to do all needed post-processing of the sound outside of the sequencer. This includes panning, adding reverb, EQing individual instruments and maybe even some light compression on some sounds. This means that what goes into your sequencer is the production-quality final sound, ready for export. This approach makes most sense if the FX chain stays the same all the time with no tweaks needed.\n<p>+ What you hear is the final sound. Set it up once, have it in all projects.<br \/>\n&#8211; Making changes can be cumbersome; exporting the untreated sound means switching stuff off in the template.<\/li>\n<li>Audio to a different application\/output: If you are the lucky owner of a kick-ass mixing desk or use special software for that purpose (for example a dedicated PT rig), you can also route the audio to this external source directly from the template instead of first feeding it back to your sequencer.\n<p>+ As flexible as you can get in terms of routing<br \/>\n&#8211; Harder to set up; also it usually requires some sort of external audio interface or virtual audio cables (like JACK).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>So much for today. I hope you got some idea of how to approach planning a template. In part III, we will have an in-depth look at the most popular solution for building templates, VSL Vienna Ensemble Pro 5 before finally planning an example template in part IV.
