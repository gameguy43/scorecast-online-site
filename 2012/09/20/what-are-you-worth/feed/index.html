					<description><![CDATA[Service.

I wonder how long it&#039;s not really been about the music, because well, &quot;everyone can write music&quot;. Heck, you can even get a Chinese to write music for you for peanuts over the internet.

I do agree about the name brand and surely it seems to work for some people and consumers, but I don&#039;t personally buy into &quot;just the name&quot; being valuable as for me the music matters more than the person writing it. And the production experience surely matters for the production team and the director!

It&#039;s the whole package that you&#039;re selling, not a particular aspect of it. But given that the music is not always enough, then I&#039;d vote that it&#039;s quality of service, easy-going and trouble-free collaboration and price that make or break a deal.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nicely done, Brian.  Of all the things that might be up for adjudication (music, credits, awards, etc.) YOU are the one thing every filmmaker knows how to adjudicate.  How you present is the single most important element in finding work and relationships today.  A &quot;likeable genius&quot; in which the adjective carries more weight than the noun.

					<description><![CDATA[Great article Brian, which touches on a number of related issues and I agree about your pricing model directly relating to your personal brand value. Whilst building your brand there are essentially two dimensions of great importance, controllable outcomes and non-controllable outcomes. What I mean by this is that however great the quality of our work, it does not necessary directly influence the success of the final product and its acceptance with the audience. So we can qualify the work we do to aim for a film or game which is likely to be successful and we can control the quality of the work we produce. What we cannot control is the eventual success of the movie which sometimes needs a fair amount of luck on low budget films. Without the escape velocity that a successful film or game gives you we are left in an orbit of working for low or no pay to raise our profiles, to get IMDb credits, get royalties and write for libraries and cover our cost. I would like to know besides luck and contacts how young and unknown composers can achieve escape velocity to bridge the monetisation gap?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amen to that Brian.  I got to a point that I explain my to be clients that they are buying talent, and not music and for them to listen to my work and make up their mind themselves. Saying NO (another one of Dean Ogden&#039;s way cool topics) became a part of my agenda, and I truly prefer at this point to not have a gig then have a overworked and underpaid one. It all leads to respect and admiration, two things you will only earn by not making your craft a 99c asset.  There is time, electricity, software, loads of energy, things anyone claiming to be able to do this can mention as building blocks in order to reach a deal, but then there is... YOU, and your talent. Your ability to make something many others might not, at least not in the unique way you can. Every human being is unique (although many try not to...) and aside from education, craft and knowledge, the one point that is intangible when it comes to a price tag is one&#039;s self. One&#039;s spirituality and the way he/she will perceive and create music over someone else&#039;s image and story.  That s my price. Take it or leave it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Brian--awesome article.  I&#039;ve been surrounded by &#039;revenue makers&#039;--actual heads of businesses lately, and have been thinking--are film composers revenue makers, or are they &#039;staff&#039; to a producer and a director?  Perhaps they are &#039;staff&#039;.  Regardless, a composer clearly adds value to a production, via their music, their know-how, their rapport with other members of the team.  The feedback I have gotten about my own work, music aside, is that I&#039;m quick to respond and communicate, and, clichéd word aside, I&#039;m nice.  Being nice has gotten people to call me back and have a conversation.

One area that isn&#039;t easy to overcome as a beginning composer is that the value an experienced composer adds to a production is their name.  How to overcome this?  Be persistent and build up your own group of people who do know your name, and make your excellent work part of the package.  Get to know people any way you can, ideally not in the &#039;hi hi hello there, please listen to my music&#039; mode.  ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well said, Brian.  This is encouraging because it&#039;s really easy to get lost in all of the technical details that go into this particular job. 


Ultimately, I guess it really is all about people and how you connect with them (musically and otherwise).
