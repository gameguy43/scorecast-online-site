					<description><![CDATA[art is always a part of the time it was made and the time is a part of the art.
if you do your own way and ignore the today coolness factor you can win or loose:
if you win others will follow your ideas and you make a start to a new area.
if you loose you just never will be heared. probably the story of most potentional innovators.

but there is no timeless art. there are outstanding treasures in all styles and areas. 
they will last for ever (or at least a while).

for me it&#039;s rather easy to do the &#039;cool&#039; things... just look around and copy styles.
much harder is to avoid &#039;uncool&#039; things. there are always some habits or things i like which doesn&#039;t fit.
i.e. electronic club music: i wish i could do harmony changes... but it is soooooo uncool!
or playing a sax solo in film score music... but it is sooooooo uncool!
or use a dx7-piano... no wait, this is even to uncool for me :-)
much harder is to avoid ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[really great films will always be cool,like dearhunter or casablanca,they stand the test of time ,thats like anything and though Duke Ellington might be uncool to modern dubstep youth they will grow up, and thinking Modern Talking was cool too,now it could be cool as a art concept with comic twist to show how cheezy music can be fed to people if there are means and I remember my father buying five of their albums back in the 80&#039;s and he was an visual arts proffesor ,photograper ,played dixiland trumpet and listened to opera.
But I must confess that once a year  when I get into nostalgic mood I put on the cd and hum to Youre My Heart,Youre My Soul  tu bi dubidubidubi]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great topic, and great points all around, Jai. What ultimately stands the test of time may be a subjective thing to different people. What may lead us astray sometimes is when we try to objectify creativity by being functional to whatever seems to currently work. As you&#039;ve pointed out so well, today&#039;s idea of what works may make people snicker in 20 years. I wonder if that duration may start to shrink. I just saw a recent South Park where they were satirizing the driving music from &quot;Inception.&quot; I found it pretty hilarious, and I think it kind of speaks to what you&#039;re suggesting.  

It seems to me that the constant challenge, especially when working within a landscape of a variety of tastes and influences, is to strike a balance of originality that&#039;s identifiable from different perspectives. Not an easy thing to bite off, but like Michael said, it&#039;s a goal worth aiming for.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a bit of a dichotomy.  We composers want to make something that leaves a mark for the ages.  We strive to make something cool and relevant but I fear all too often films are made purely to make a buck.  And that unfortunately doesn&#039;t necessarily include longevity.  
But that doesn&#039;t mean we shouldn&#039;t try.

As to the question of what keeps something cool?  For sure &quot;story&quot;.  People have been telling stories since day dot and film is just another creative way to do that.  There are certain story arcs that people just &#039;get&#039; in some primeval part of the soul.  I once went into the wrong movie theater and found myself watching a Spanish film (with no subtitles?!).  I decided to say because the lead actress was pretty hot, but I was amazed how (though I speak no Spanish)  I was still able to be taken on a powerful, emotional ride purely on the actors performance + music.

Watch Star Wars again.  Or West Side Story.  If you can lay aside your criticisms of visual execution and cheesy scripts for a moment, they are wonderful, timeless stories, supported by fantastic &#038; still &quot;cool&quot;, relevant music.  I think the music is still cool because it supports the store so well.  And let&#039;s be honest, created by master craftsmen.

					<description><![CDATA[Good question. I think the popularity and convenience of atmospheric and textural sounds can tempt us to reach for our sound designy synth of choice (cough &quot;omnishphere&quot;) more often than is healthy for our creativity. Admittedly there have been times when I have copped out and hit the cool button on my synth instead of looking for another solution but these days I am better about making conscious decisions to use a particular type of sound or to use it in a more subtle or nuanced way. All in all I think that sound design and textural synths have their place but I&#039;m trying harder and harder to pick my spots and not lean on them for my core sound.]]></description>
