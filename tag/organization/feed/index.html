				<description><![CDATA[Composer Stephan Römer in his first article in SCO has found a true gold nugget: Tyberis Music Database allows you to fingerprint your audio files and recognize them later just by playing them back. It is perfect for keeping track of cue use in a TV series or similar scoring situation.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Music recognition for composers</strong></p>
<p>This is my first article for ScoreCast Online. I hope you enjoy!</p>
<p>Yesterday, I stumbled across a very useful tool and thought it might be useful for some of you guys.</p>
<p>A couple of words about my background and why this tool is useful for me: For quite a while now, I&#8217;m the composer of the German TV series &#8220;Die Fallers&#8221;. In the meanwhile I have over 700 cues that I composed for the series. When I receive new episodes, they are usually temped with my own music and from time to time there are themes which might be worth to be used as a basis or be developed further for a scene.  Now the problem is: how to find that single track in an archive with over 900 tracks? Of course I could call up the editor and ask for each single track they used. But usually, they are already busy with other projects. So what could we do to make our life easier? A database? Good starting point. With tags, keywords, descriptions? Well, yes, this might work but the time to create an extensive database with all kinds of bells and whistles would be immense. And there is no guarantee that you will find what you are looking for just by searching for keywords and descriptions.</p>
<p>The solution is (drum roll): a database of audio fingerprints, or to put it differently: music recognition. Think Shazam, SoundHound, etc… but for you very own music library!</p>
<p>I had a hard time to find a tool for this task but here it is: <a title="Tyberis Music Database" href="http://music.tyberis.com/" target="_blank">http://music.tyberis.com/</a></p>
<div id="attachment_1738" style="width: 399px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../?attachment_id=1738" rel="attachment wp-att-1738"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1738" class="size-medium wp-image-1738" title="TyberisMusicDB_Screenshot" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/TyberisMusicDB-389x282.jpg" alt="Tyberis Music Database" width="389" height="282" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/TyberisMusicDB-389x282.jpg 389w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/TyberisMusicDB-640x464.jpg 640w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/09/TyberisMusicDB.jpg 833w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1738" class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot of Tyberis Music Database</p></div>
<p>What you basically do is, you feed the program with your own music (WAV or MP3 but only at 44,1kHz and 16Bit!) and it creates fingerprints for these tracks. Creating the database happens fairly quickly. I added all my tracks within 2 or 3 minutes. Now after having done that, you put a check on &#8220;channel active&#8221; (this will monitor the audio output, you have to set the right one in preferences) and play back the temp track in your DAW or audio player and it will recognize the played track and show the title in the database, voilà!</p>
<p>As you can read on the website, the program was actually intended for bands who want to monitor radio stations for their songs. You see, there are many possibilities!</p>
<p>The only downside of this great program is that it&#8217;s Windows only. But it can be run in Parallels, VirtualBox, VMWare Fusion or in Bootcamp.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[In this second installment, Logic expert Yaiza Varona explores various techniques that can be used to speed up our workflow. Time is money after all....]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Speeding up your workflow</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today writing great music unfortunately isn´t enough- you need to write it fast!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, to increase as much as possible our writing speed is absolutely pivotal. As we were discussing in the previous article, navigating the project is what consumes most time from our tasks, and that is when customizing Logic can really save precious instants that by the end of the day will have spared us much time and creative energy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We should speak about THE TEMPLATES (oh, no!!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes. They might be Templates but we are Logic Crusaders. All is good, all is fine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ok, a quick reminder here: we are not talking about templates including loaded instruments (which of course can be created too), but Logic project templates in terms of having a customized work station (shortcuts defined, interface set up for easy navigation, etc). The use of instrument templates accoriding to genre, etc. remains a choice for every composer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Logic has some custom templates for some typical projects that can be useful (for working to Picture for example), and it´s worth giving them a look, even if just as a starting point to create our own perfect template (or ideally, different templates according to what kind of project are we going to tackle). You can find them when opening a new project, by choosing the option “open from template”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>So, how to set up a template of our choice? What basic aspects to consider?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main guideline should be ease of use and quick access to the tools / features you know you´re going to use the most. This includes for example customizing the zooming and choice of tools for every window, defining what features to show (if we´re going to use them often) and which ones to hide from quick access, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <em>Focus, focus, focus!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First of all, you should try to use all screen space available to avoid zooming in and out. To have to reach out for your target continuosly consumes most of your time. Think of it as having your wardrobe tidy: you can find easily what you´re looking for if you can see it properly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unless one has an enormous screen, usually real estate makes a big difference. You can choose the exact degree of zoom you need for your window of choice, you can remove the Inspector if you don´t need it, or hide the tool bar. Anything you need to make your navigation more comfortable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Am I properly armed? Do I have my tools at the ready?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We all know where to find the tools we need, but having to access them by navigating with the mouse from one corner of the Arrange to the other simply is not efficient. We need to have our more commonly used tools / keyboard shortcuts easily accessible, and decide which ones we are going to use in which sections of our project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, if you´re going to work mainly with audio in the Arrange area, you might need to have quick access to the Flex Tool, so it could be handy to have it in your Tool Bar. As well, if you need to trim audio regions often, you can choose as alternate tool (right click on your mouse) the Marquee tool so you can both select and trim without practically moving your right hand from the mouse. If, on the other hand, you decide to do that audio editing in the Wave editor, you might consider creating a screenset (wait, don´t panic, they can be cute!) inside your template dedicated to your Wave editor, instead of opening and closing it everytime you need to access it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another example: you´re going to work mainly editing MIDI – in this case, you might want to have a dedicated screenset for the Piano Roll, and use as alternate tool the one you will be using most (velocity or pencil tool for example).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, in our template we can edit different screensets. Hmmmm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Screensets. (eerie music here)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>What are the screensets? Is it true that they bite?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes. But we are fierce composers and we fear nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Screensets show a customized window and settings for every number of the computer´s keyboard. This means that you can set up your arrange window just the way you want it (including zoom options, region shown, tools choice, etc), assign it to number 1, and go back to that working environement whenever you wish by pressing 1 at any time. Alternatively, you can choose showing both arrange and piano roll for example in another screenset, or just piano roll, or just the mixer, or mixer and score&#8230;.you name it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You do the choice, Logic keeps it under a number in your keypad and you can summon it at any time. Just like Gandalf.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, something very interesting: screensets can be locked or unlocked. You will know a screenset is locked if it shows a bullet by the number and unlocked when it doesn´t. This basically means that if the screenset is locked, any edit you do to it (zooming in and out, changing tools, adding new areas) will not remain once you leave the screenset. For example, if I edit locked screenset 1 and then use screenset 2, whenever I press 1 again I will find the locked initial version of screenset 1, and all edits done will have been ignored by Logic. Whether it is useful for you to have your screenset locked or unlocked will be up to you to decide: for example, when editing can be advantageous to leave it unlocked (since you might change your mind about the zoom degree) and if you dedicate your screenset to a global view of your project, you might prefer to keep it locked so you can go back to it at any time and see your whole arrange with just a quick look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Locking / Unlocking a screenset is very simple: in the screenset tab menu, you toggle between unlock / lock and apply whatever changes you wish.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>How to set up Screensets?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Very easy; just press a number of your keypad and check what happens in tab Screensets in Logic main menu (between Window and Help). You will see that your chosen number appears in this tab and the interface as you had it displayed is your starting point. Now, according to what you want your screenset, customize your interface and you will have by default that result as an unlocked screenset. If you wish to keep it precisely like that, remember to lock it so you can go back to it in that precise state anytime.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Hmmm&#8230;much to consider&#8230;.any practical examples?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sure, here it goes a very simple suggestion for getting started. A template that mainly consists of three simple screensets according to the three areas for a given project I tend to use the most: Arrange, Piano Roll and Mixer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Screenset 1: A big arrange window, most space visible possible, for a full vision of the whole track (no inspector, no tool bar, all the screen devoted to your beautiful project!). This allows you to keep in mind the whole picture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="../../../?attachment_id=1563" rel="attachment wp-att-1563"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1563 aligncenter" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Arrange-389x243.png" alt="" width="389" height="243" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Arrange-389x243.png 389w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Arrange-640x400.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Screenset 2: Arrange / Piano Roll for editing MIDI. A small instance of the Arrange in the upper part and a bigger Piano Roll window for easy MIDI editing. Something useful to be edited here can be having the alternate tool in the Piano Roll assigned to velocity or Pencil tool so one can edit quickly any note.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="../../../?attachment_id=1564" rel="attachment wp-att-1564"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1564 aligncenter" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Arrange-Piano-Roll-389x243.png" alt="" width="389" height="243" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Arrange-Piano-Roll-389x243.png 389w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Arrange-Piano-Roll-640x400.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Screenset 3: Arrange / Mixer following the same spirit – Arrange acting as a small guide and the whole Mixer shown. Note that zoom has a limit in the Mixer, but even this little bit helps a lot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="../../../?attachment_id=1565" rel="attachment wp-att-1565"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1565 aligncenter" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Arrange-Mixer-389x243.png" alt="" width="389" height="243" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Arrange-Mixer-389x243.png 389w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Arrange-Mixer-640x400.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course you can do many others depending on your area of interest; for example using Score, already preparing scores for printing, etc. Showing the Environement, for complex routing, etc. Can you imagine the possibilities?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Ok, I got the customizing of my dreams. Now how do I keep it as a template?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that we´ve spent some while (come on, it wasn´t so bad!) customizing our template, we simple go to File / Save as Template and give it a name. We should name it something epic, we are so proud of our little baby!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>So, where are my templates kept, and can I use them elsewhere?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, you can! You can save them and take them with you, even if you´re going to work in someone else´s Logic (so you don´t have to start all your customizing from scratch!).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Templates are kept in User / Library / Application Support / Logic / Project Templates – voilá!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you just feel like importing a particular Screenset that you liked from another project, you can also just import it using Settings / Import Project Settings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hope this helps you to work a little faster and with less effort so you can fully concentrate on your music.Questions, suggestions, any more thinking about this is more than welcome. Please don´t hesitate to get in touch if you have some tips after your years of experience using Logic, it can be very helpful for others!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Logic users of the world, share your tips!</p>

As much as we can try to come up with a complete answer, the only true answer really is, "Whatever you can!" The bigger question—and the one I want to tackle here—is "How much money do live players eat up during a film score's production and how do you plan for the bloodshed?" The answer to that questions is... "I wish there was an answer."

Now that I've been no help at all, let's see if we can figure it out together...]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>&#8220;How much money will I make as a film composer?&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the six million dollar question, isn&#8217;t it? I get this question from aspiring composers more than any other, and I never know what to say. As much as I try to come up with a cool, suave answer to their query, all I can usually muster is something like &#8220;Whatever you can!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lame and disappointing? Yes. Honest and truthful? Absolutely.</p>
<p>The bigger question — and the one I want to tackle here — is &#8220;How much money do live players eat up during a film score&#8217;s production and how do you plan for the bloodshed?&#8221; The answer to that questions is&#8230; &#8220;I wish there was an answer.&#8221; The fact is that it really depends on a load of different variables, but I&#8217;ll try to define some of them here for you to help get you thinking about how you should budget your up-fronts to &#8220;pay&#8221; for your score.</p>
<p>But first, let&#8217;s start with some customary &#8220;assumptions&#8221;:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m assuming that:</p>
<p><strong>1) You prefer quality.</strong> I&#8217;m not a believer in skimping or cutting corners. Every score I have ever written has contained live elements of some sort. Whether I was able to hire Richie Sambora to play guitar for me on a TV show or if I record timpani in my studio on my own, the fact is that I made a deal with myself early on that I would go live whenever I possibly could. A live performance, even if it isn&#8217;t the best live performance, still does miracles for a recorded score that samples simply cannot achieve. I would be willing to pay for union musicians to come in and perform on my work for a couple of reasons. First, LA players are simply the best in the world. They make everything sound better. I like having my toes in the player pool around LA because then when I get to hire a full ensemble, pending availability, I&#8217;m more likely to get who I want because of our relationship and work history together.</p>
<p><strong>2) Your score will accommodate live players.</strong> If the score to your project calls for a band consisting of piano, synth pads, mouth percussion, and Indonesian finger cymbals (I once scored a short film with this line-up, believe it or not!), then you are probably not going to need any live players. Piano samples are good enough nowadays that you can get away with Synthogy Ivory or NI Akoustik Piano or something. Anything to keep from spending that $500 to get the ol&#8217; Blüthner tuned up, right? It is really the scores that require orchestral instrumentation of some sort that we are referring to here.</p>
<p><strong>3) You have <em>some</em> budget. </strong>You cannot start with zero. I mean, <em>technically</em> you can, but it&#8217;s not going to be fun for you. To make money, you need to spend some money. Your score will not sound very good if you have no money to put into it. I say this for two reasons, the first one being somewhat obvious, and the second&#8230; not so much. First, no money into a score means that the score will be all sampled (Refer to point number 1 above!). Secondly, no money into a score means no money out of a score for you, and how much do you think *that* scenario is going to motivate you to do your best work? The principals withholding budget from their composer is both a sign of bad planning on their part as well as an assumption of lesser value on your product and its ability to service their film. Not a good combo. Try and get your director or producer to find you some money. Anything. Anything that will give you some kind of reward for scoring this thing. If they can pay you in widgets, then take the widgets and sell them for some money to hire live players.</p>
<p><strong>The Package Deal</strong><br />
Back in the good old days, composers were given a creative fee to write the score and then the studio paid for the rest of the expenses. Studios had musicians on staff that were just there all day and if you needed them, you ran out to the stage and recorded something really quick. If not, they all just sat there all day hoping you came out to visit. Obviously, this became very silly very quickly, and with emerging technology and the composer&#8217;s ability to synthesize a majority of the score at home, &#8220;the package deal&#8221; became popular.</p>
<p>A<em> package deal</em> is when the production gives you a set amount of money from the overall budget and you are then responsible to hire all of the people necessary to bring the score in on-time and on budget, while hopefully maintaining a decent creative fee out of whatever is left after everything is paid for. As you can imagine, it can be tough, if not impossible, to keep any of this money, depending on what the producers &#8220;say&#8221; they want out of the score. If they give you 12k as your music budget, and they want &#8220;live orchestra&#8221;, good luck. You might be able to augment your samples with a smattering of live players, but there will not be anything left after you are done to feed your family with. You either need to negotiate a higher package, have something else going on while you score that film that will supplement your income, or leave the deal on the table and walk away. Those are you options.</p>
<p><strong>The Music Budget </strong><br />
So, let&#8217;s assume that you have some money to play with and that you are excited to get started scoring this new film that you&#8217;ve just been assigned.  Let&#8217;s also say that this film is at the very bottom of what most independent (and by &#8220;independent&#8221;, I mean truly <em>independent</em> &#8230; of a studio, that is) films are budgeting for music these days: $34,000. That is actually where you should be if you are hired onto a low-end indie feature. In fact, if you get *this* much, pat yourself on the back. You are lucky. It should be higher, but it rarely is.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not used to working with a budget of this magnitude before, it looks like a ton of dough at first glance. But in this gig, things add up and it starts to get complicated quickly. Ready to see where it all goes, and how fast? Grab your tissue box&#8230; Let&#8217;s do this!</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Picture+6.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-854" title="Picture+6" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Picture+6-300x188.png" alt="" width="300" height="188" /></a>In a typical &#8220;package deal&#8221; scoring agreement, the composer would get paid in thirds — one-third of the total budget upon attachment to the project, one-third upon commencement of scoring, and the final third upon delivery. This will work fine with our budget since by the time we are ready to record any orchestra, we&#8217;ll already have been paid twice, to the tune of $17k. If we stay disciplined and stick to our Hard Expenses budget of $15,900, we&#8217;ll have $1,100 left over to apply to the rest of our expenses later on. Then if we come in at least under budget with our Soft Expenses, we&#8217;ll make a nice little $14,955 when all is said and done. Additionally, if we can somehow trim a bit out of our Soft Expenses, then we can probably get that number up to around $16k. That&#8217;s not a horrible profit on a film that budgeted 34k to begin with. It&#8217;s not a ton of dough, but for an entry level indie flick, it&#8217;s a nice shot in the arm to start out your career.</p>
<p><strong>Hard Expenses</strong><br />
For the sake of our discussion here, I&#8217;m going to refer to the things that are absolutely non-negotiable — in other words, &#8220;you NEED them&#8221; — as hard expenses. These would be expenses such as musicians, a place to record them (scoring stage or recording studio), an engineer to run those sessions for you, a contractor to get you the players, etc. If you are in a time crunch and/or you cannot do it all yourself, you can also toss an orchestrator into the mix along with an assistant to help you carve audio stems when you get down to delivery time and things start to get tense.</p>
<p><em>Musicians </em><br />
Using the example of some of the films I&#8217;ve scored with budgets like these, I&#8217;m going to say that a 20-piece union string section is going to run you about 10k for a single three hour session. These figures change any time the union renegotiates its contract with producers, so you&#8217;ll always want to call the union <em>before</em> you start your budget to get the most accurate numbers&#8230; but for now, you can see from our mock budget that the orchestra will be our biggest expense, and for good reason. We are not going to skimp on our players. These players are the saving grace of your sound and they are going to basically dress up a lot of what would otherwise be lacking because of our small budget. I&#8217;ve used players on short film budgets that were a fraction of what this one is, and the scores sound like something out of a major studio tent-pole film, so&#8230; our musicians get top dollar. No arguments.</p>
<p>Now, you *can* get a better rate if you were to consider recording in another part of the world like eastern Europe or even Russia, but I would use the word <em>&#8220;better&#8221;</em> very carefully here. &#8220;Better&#8221; doesn&#8217;t necessarily always mean &#8220;better sounding&#8221;. I&#8217;ve recorded in places where you are wise to schedule all of the tough cues toward the start of the day or you run the risk of musicians heading to the pub at lunch and coming back tipsy. Not a great deal for your afternoon sessions! You also have to account for the fact that if you are recording here in town, you are getting up everyday from your place across town and maybe driving 30 minutes to record. Translation: No Overhead. If you are oversees, you have to pay hotel expenses, airfare (roundtrip to Bratislava is running around $1,300 right now), food, and customary travel expenses. That being said, it pays to research the crap out of your &#8220;oversees&#8221; session possibilities before you take the leap. People don&#8217;t realize it, but over the last ten years or so the American Federation of Musicians (or &#8220;AFM&#8221;, the musicians&#8217; union) has made it as easy as ever to record an orchestra in LA or New York, having created a new fee schedule that will accommodate virtually any film production no matter how big or small the music budget. They even have a &#8220;demo scale&#8221; which is just what it sounds like: a reduced scale for those times that you&#8217;d like to have a live orchestra on your&#8230; wait for it&#8230; DEMO. Wouldn&#8217;t *that* be kick ass?</p>
<p>For a group of more than 35 players, union rates are currently hovering around $262 per player/per session. If you require fewer players, the rates go up from there. Don&#8217;t forget that you&#8217;ll need to pay your contractor (also known sometimes as an &#8220;orchestra manager&#8221;), which is the person that puts your orchestra together for you. They make double scale, which is simply twice the standard musicians&#8217; rate of pay. So in our case, since we are using only 20 players, our player rate will be about $300 per player/session. Then, you add the contractor to that at double scale, which is $600, bringing you to a total player cost of $6,600. Sweet! We budgeted 10k for players, so this means we are already way under budget, right? Well&#8230; not so fast.</p>
<p><em>Doubling </em><br />
You are having one of your violinists and one of your cellists play solos on two of your cues. You are also asking one of your players to &#8220;double&#8221; on another instrument. <em>Doubling</em> usually applies mainly to woodwind or brass players (a flutist also playing piccolo, or a trumpet player also playing flugelhorn). Piano players aren&#8217;t considered doublists if you also need them on celesta. Whatever the case, musicians aren&#8217;t going to double for free. For these special skills, they receive additional pay.</p>
<p><em>Cartage</em><br />
We also have two (2) double basses in our line-up. That means that we also will be taking care of their cartage fees. &#8220;Cartage&#8221; is the cost of getting a larger, less manageable instrument to and from the recording venue. Cartage fees always apply to double bass, tuba, cello, percussion (tympani, bass drum, vibes, tubular chimes, etc.), baritone sax, bass sax, contra-bass clarinet, contra bassoon, accordion, baritone horn, and contra bass trombone. AFM says that cartage on one single double bass is about $12 per session, but in LA, cartage fees are often billed at a higher rate than AFM projections, so we&#8217;ll add in $200 for today&#8217;s bassists. I&#8217;m not a union percussionist, but as a drummer I&#8217;m well aware of the costs of shipping gear. It&#8217;s not easy, and the employer is almost always responsible for it&#8230; most certainly so when it is a union gig.</p>
<p>As you can see, it starts adding up fast, and when all is said and done, we are looking at about $10,000 to get everybody paid and taken care of for a standard 3-hour session. You also need to take into account that this number is ONLY for a single 3-hour session. At 45 minutes of recording time per hour (AFM regulations give musicians a 15-minute break every hour), you are only talking about 15 minutes or so of finished music if you record at a rate of 5 minutes per hour (fairly standard for an LA orchestra). In a hybrid-score situation, this might be just what you need. If your score is wholly orchestral, however, you&#8217;ll obviously need a lot more time. Translation: You&#8217;re gonna need more money.</p>
<p>There are so many factors that go into accounting your budget for players. How much music do you need to record? How many players will record it? Are there any doubles? Are there any soloists? Does the *whole* band need to be there for all of the sessions, or can you record with everyone for the bigger cues and then start cutting players as you scale down the score to the more intimate cues? How much cartage is involved? Be smart. Use the schedule to your advantage. Don&#8217;t be stupid about what you can and cannot get away with using samples — if you can record it, then record it! Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask questions&#8230; there aren&#8217;t any dumb questions, and if there are&#8230; JUST BE WILLING TO LOOK DUMB! Who gives a crap! You won&#8217;t give one either after you are hit with your first meal penalty because you didn&#8217;t ask questions! Use your people&#8230; your concertmaster, your union rep. Talk to your players&#8230; go out on the floor and shake hands with them. Be genuine and thank them for playing and being who they are. Use your contractor&#8230; your contractor can either be your best friend or your worst nightmare. They are there to help you, but ultimately, their job is to protect those union musicians. They have the power to shut down your session if you are abusing musicians by not following the rules.</p>
<p>The bottom line with players is this: Everybody is working for the good of the product. You call the shots, but you have to follow the rules and treat people as they deserve to be treated. Do it right, and live session players will make your little 34k score sound like a 100k score. I&#8217;m not lying.</p>
<p><em>Recording Venue </em><br />
The next expenditure that we&#8217;ll need to shell out some good money for is the venue in which we&#8217;ll record the score. Under normal circumstances (read: a larger budget), we would contact a stage here in town like Warners, Fox, or Sony (Eastwood Scoring Stage, Newman Scoring Stage, or the Barbara Streisand Scoring Stage, respectively) to record our full-sized orchestra. But since we are working with a smaller group this time out — 20 string players, to be exact — we&#8217;ll save some money here and record in one of the many excellent recording studios here in Los Angeles that are known for getting a solid sound with a smaller ensemble. Rooms like Westlake Audio&#8217;s Studio &#8220;D&#8221;, Capitol &#8220;A&#8221;, Henson&#8217;s big room, or Glenwood Place in Burbank are all perfect for this size of group, and they are also all known for getting a great string sound. For three-hour sessions, you can expect to pay between $800 on the low end to approximately $1,500 or even $2,000 on the high end for one of these rooms. Scoring stages are considerably more, but again, you won&#8217;t need one unless you are scoring a studio feature with a large music budget which will require a 50+ piece orchestra. If you are, then that discussion is beyond the scope of this article. We&#8217;ll save that one for next time!</p>
<p>We are going to go with a place that quoted $1,200 for a 3-hour session. With that fee of $1,200, you&#8217;ll get a lot of stuff. First, and most obviously, the room—complete with all of the booth gear, the big recording console, and the lounge facilities of the studio. The studio&#8217;s piano is going to cost extra, but since we are using the Ivory plug-in, we won&#8217;t be needing that, so money saved there. For our rental of the studio, we also get use of all of the studio&#8217;s microphones, although your engineer will most likely bring their own tried and tested set-up. Just let them, believe me. They know what they are doing.</p>
<p><em>The Engineer </em><br />
Speaking of which, almost always you&#8217;ll want to differ to your engineer as to which room you should use in the first place. Nobody knows the attributes and nuances of stages and rooms better than your recording engineer. In fact, that is part of the reputation of a great recordist: Their ears are tuned to the point that they understand and are aware of the places to get the best recordings, given the specifics of your project.</p>
<p>The engineer might be the single most important piece of the puzzle to getting a great film score sound, so bargain-shopping for one is not something I would recommend doing. Expect to pay between $800 to $2000 per three-hour session for a great engineer. This might seem like a lot of money, but I assure you, they earn every penny. You won&#8217;t know this until your first time out with a good engineer, but they are working far beyond that three hours of recording time. They arrive to your session hours ahead of even you (sometimes even the day before) to set-up microphones and place music stands and seats, insuring that you have plenty of separation between instrument groups. Many times, the engineer will work with an assistant (usually the salaried assistant at the studio you are recording at), and will put this person to work running cable and positioning microphone stands. The fee for the engineering assistant is often included in the studio rental fee. If it isn&#8217;t, ask if the studio is willing to roll the assistant&#8217;s fee into the cost of the rental. Most places will.</p>
<p>One last thing about engineers: When you find a great engineer that you work well with, stick with them. Bring them with you on all of your jobs. Repeated work with that person will lead to the two of you being able to finish each others&#8217; musical sentences, and that is a luxury when things are tense in the control booth that you&#8217;ll appreciate down the road. For years, Tom Geron was my engineer. Lately, as Tom has taken on more and more work as an engineer for pop radio studio sessions, I&#8217;ve used other engineers, like Michael Arvold. On my orchestral sessions for &#8220;The Way Home&#8221;, we had a ProTools melt-down that seemed at first to be pretty monumental. As I sat there hyper-ventilating, Michael was able to fix the problem in a few minutes, saving us from wasting precious time and money with all the musicians staring at us through the glass. These are the times when history with a solid engineer is priceless.</p>
<p><em>Orchestrator</em><br />
I&#8217;ll be brief with this one, and I&#8217;ll abstain from starting a flame war as to whether or not orchestrators are important to the process. For the purposes of our example here, I budgeted one in at $900. Orchestrators typically work on a &#8220;page rate&#8221; — a certain amount of dollars for one page of orchestrated score. A common misconception among newer composers is that orchestrators and copyists are one-in-the-same. They are not. An orchestrator *can* also copy if that is the arrangement, but they are not automatically expected to do so. Copying is normally considered a separate line item from orchestration.</p>
<p>Most composers are used to paying orchestrators ±$90 per page of finished score. This is a general guideline, however, as I&#8217;ve paid less than that and more at times, depending on who the orchestrator was and what the demand was for that orchestrator&#8217;s particular brand of orchestration. You can see how this will add up when you consider that a page of score is typically four measures long for a full group of players. However, for our little 20-piece string section, we can probably have the orchestrator get most of it on two or three pages for each instrument group. This however, has little or no bearing on how much they will charge. Just because they can squeeze everything on one page doesn&#8217;t mean their page rate now goes down (another common misconception). Communication here is key, so be clear and get all of the facts when you hire your orchestrator. They will save your ass in most cases, so paying them what they are worth is something that you just need to be damned happy about.</p>
<p><em>Conductor</em><br />
I&#8217;m going to assume, since this is a little string date, that you are going to conduct your string players yourself. You may choose not to do this, either because your director will be there and you are nervous leaving them alone in the booth, or because you simply aren&#8217;t an experienced conductor. Either is fine and you shouldn&#8217;t be ashamed of those reasons for staying in the booth and hiring this role out to someone who can handle it for you. On the other hand, I heartily recommend you conducting your scores at least every once in a while. It is good practice, and it also just makes for a different kind of session. There is nothing quite like conducting players to a piece of music you have written. Often, you can evoke more emotion out of a group that you are conducting yourself, simply because the players see and feel your emotion behind your own music.</p>
<p>Many orchestrators also conduct. SCOREcast&#8217;s Brian Satterwhite recently orchestrated on a score that I wrote. As our recording dates approached, it became clear that I needed Brian to also conduct so that I could stay focused on the sound of the score with my director and manage the sessions from within the booth.</p>
<p><strong>Soft Expenses </strong><br />
Our &#8220;soft expenses&#8221; are going to be things that would be great to have, but are not absolutely necessary. I usually try and include these things when I budget out a job, but that&#8217;s just me. You can do what you want&#8230; I&#8217;ve just found that putting these things in the budget allows me to keep everything related to the project in my business accounting and separate from my personal accounting. With this method, I keep the little things that add up over time from going on a personal credit card for convenience sake. It&#8217;s not so convenient on April 15th when my accountant shows me that I accidentally paid for my team&#8217;s plane tickets to the premiere in San Francisco with my personal Visa card!<br />
<em></em></p>
<p><em>Studio Upgrades</em><br />
I&#8217;ve included this here to illustrate a point more than anything: If I had a nickel for all of the times I&#8217;ve been told by an aspiring composer, &#8220;As soon as I get my first payment from them, I&#8217;m going to upgrade my studio so I&#8217;m ready to roll!&#8221;&#8230; well&#8230; I&#8217;d be a very rich man. &#8220;Getting your first gig&#8221; is NOT the time to make sure you are technologically ready to start scoring films. You need to have that all ironed out ahead of time. Here&#8217;s why: If you are prepared for this gig, and you have done your homework early instead of waiting until you have the gig to do it, this entire category of expenses becomes pure profit. Said another way&#8230; That&#8217;s cold hard cash straight into your bank account! It&#8217;s a harsh awakening to start out a project having to hand over a major portion of your potential profits to a place like Guitar Center. Blech! That&#8217;s a soul-sucking event if there ever was one! Tackle the due diligence of getting your rig up to snuff before you sign a project. Trust me&#8230; you&#8217;d rather hit the ground running with a rig that works than have your head in manuals for the first two weeks of your scoring schedule.</p>
<p><em>Filmmaker Meetings/Meals/Gas/Auto</em><br />
I know what you are thinking&#8230; &#8220;Deane&#8230; seriously? Really?&#8221;. Yes. I. Do. I ABSOLUTELY figure in my meetings at Starbucks or dinner with my clients, as well as the automotive expenses to make them all happen. Why not? If not for those meetings, I would be totally satisfied to eat at home with my family like any other night of my life. This is a necessary expense that I incur in order to take care of my clients, so yes&#8230; I take it out of the budget.</p>
<p><em>Studio Lease/Power/Materials</em><br />
These three things are expenditures that I will incur to keep the lights on in my studio while I work on this project. All three come right out of the budget. Some of the best advice I have ever heard was from my high school economics teacher, Ron Sather. He said, &#8220;Your family budget should never absorb any of your business budget liabilities.&#8221; If you have your studio in your home, I hope to all that&#8217;s holy that you are taking a tax deduction on the square footage of your studio space. The IRS allows for that and you should be taking advantage. Additionally, do not put your power, space, and materials expenses (CD cases, printer paper, pens/pencils, ink, USB cables, etc.) on the shoulders of your family or personal budget. Everything should be kept separate so that at tax time you are able to get the maximum deduction, saving you boatloads of dough.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaways</strong><br />
I hope this has been helpful. I know it is sort of hard to envision a fake budget when there really is no hard data to go on, but I&#8217;m sure you get my point. If there is anything that I think is an important takeaway from what I&#8217;ve presented here, it&#8217;s this: The reward of scoring films is mostly an emotional/spiritual/psychological one. Sometimes, there is not much money in the craft and if you really boil down the expenses, it can be a bit disconcerting. But remember: Even the top 12 guys that are scoring 80% of the tent-pole studio features in Hollywood right now&#8230; when you add up their expenditures and their work hours, their ROI is not what you might think it is. Jerry Goldsmith once said, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t like it for the love of it, you&#8217;ll hate it for the hurt of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>If it is true that financial pressure is the #1 cause of broken families in America, you can only imagine what it can do to you as a businessperson. Get yourself together and do some hardcore, pencil-sharpening work on your budget outlines for your projects before you turn them in. It is so worth all of the footwork, and this gig will be a hell of a lot more profitable for you if you do.</p>
<p><strong>What Do You Think?</strong><br />
I realize that I left out a TON of information in this article, and honestly, this topic is ginormous—I could talk about it with you for three days and we still wouldn&#8217;t cover it all. I&#8217;m committed to being on the COMMENTS this week like never before to answer any questions anyone might have about budgets&#8230; and here is my pledge: NOTHING IS OFF LIMITS. Ask away. If I can&#8217;t give you an answer, I&#8217;ll find someone who can. Let&#8217;s talk about this budgeting thing and see if we can&#8217;t wrap our heads around it a little bit more together!﻿</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sig-sanders2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-767" title="sig-sanders" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sig-sanders2.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>This weekend&#8217;s post ties together a couple of the topics we&#8217;ve touched on during first year here at SCOREcast (has it really been almost a year… we ought to do something to celebrate! Hmm…): delivery and studio organization. The question, then:</p>
<p><strong>Is a gig ever really over?</strong> Sometimes it&#8217;s clear when you&#8217;re finished (especially if things go, how you say, <em>not</em> so well). Other times, though, it seems that these ghosts of gigs past come back to haunt us over and over. More on all of this after the jump.<span id="more-296"></span></p>
<p>Something that happens more often than you&#8217;d think around here is this: I&#8217;ll get a suspiciously friendly phone call from a filmmaker I haven&#8217;t spoken to in a while. In the midst of catching up, I&#8217;ll hear that he has some Exciting News! (oboy.)</p>
<p>…Their two-year-old (or three-year-old, or six-year-old, or older) project has just been picked up by a distributor. Or they&#8217;re re-editing it for a festival. Or they just want to spruce it up or &#8220;dot all the i&#8217;s&#8221; before moving on to something new.</p>
<p>And, of course, there are a few teeeensy little technical details that need to be ironed out, the pace of technology being what it is and what-not.</p>
<p>Here it comes: Can I, their Amazing Composer, take a quick second and look through my files and send along:<br />
A) the cue sheet<br />
B) the Composer Agreement (funny how filmmakers and production companies seem to lose these!)<br />
C) a complete set of audio files/stems of the score<br />
D) a couple of revised versions of cues that &#8220;we never really nailed,&#8221; or maybe even…<br />
E) a new version of the score, mixed in 5.1 instead of stereo? (Don&#8217;t laugh about that last one. It&#8217;s happened.)</p>
<p>Well, some of this is just a good laugh on a weekday morning. There&#8217;s no way you&#8217;re gonna volunteer for this kind of duty. But it costs them nothing to see if they can squeeze a little extra work and hassle out of you for free, so they&#8217;re giving it a shot.</p>
<p>But short of that, there&#8217;s a wide range of requests that we might legitimately consider to be part of the ongoing commitment we take on when we sign our composer agreements. We should, for example, keep all of our paperwork, filed away so that we can access it whenever it&#8217;s needed. This kind of paperwork should <em>never</em> be thrown away.</p>
<p>Likewise, it shouldn&#8217;t be too time-consuming to re-deliver the score (unless your internet connection is sloooow). If they want a new <em>physical</em> version mailed to them, my opinion is that they should cover the costs of materials and postage. And they should volunteer to pay for that (but they usually don&#8217;t).</p>
<p>By the way, a similar syndrome can manifest itself before <em>any</em> time has elapsed, and I had a phone call about this from a colleague just today. Here&#8217;s how this one goes: You&#8217;re ready to submit a set of library cues to (insert name of Big Library Music Company, or maybe even Cable Network Executive, here).</p>
<p>Not only are you getting no money up front for this ingenious piece of entrepreneurship, but you get a call from the recipient asking either A) if they can keep the hard drive(s) on which you submitted the material (at which point you&#8217;re paying for the privilege of giving your music away—!) or B) if you don&#8217;t mind creating an online-searchable database of those cues… you know, &#8220;so you can be competitive with the other companies submitting cues. We don&#8217;t really want to waste time with a library if it&#8217;s not searchable online.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, those are nearly the exact words my colleague heard over the phone not 12 hours ago. As the executive was holding music placement for something like 100 cable episodes over his head. The beauty of this is that later in the conversation, the same exec uttered the phrase &#8220;I&#8217;m not comfortable with the idea of having some invoice from you hanging over my head.&#8221; (re: the hard drives, which I&#8217;m supposing the exec wanted the composer to offer up as a gift, free of obligation to use the music inside.)</p>
<p>That, to me, is equal parts painfully obscene and beautifully surreal.</p>
<p>Again, something this gratuitous is worthy of derisive laugher and not much else. But other requests sound so easy, so not-a-big-deal-just-this-once that you might get sucked in. Please, for the sake of the rest of us, consider what sort of standard operating procedure you&#8217;re committing to… and committing the rest of us to, by default.</p>
<p>Getting back to the larger point: you should have a system in place to deliver old materials. That includes organizing your completed works in such a way that they&#8217;re accessible and current in format (Jaz drives ain&#8217;t gonna cut it!). You should also take a little time when you&#8217;re not under the pressure of deadlines, to decide exactly what your own boundaries are with respect to this stuff. There are some gray areas here, which you&#8217;ll need to define on your own.</p>
<p>For example: should you be required to re-mix? Probably not. But you might be willing to batch-convert the audio into a different format if you&#8217;re asked. Or you might not. Should you re-send paperwork? Sure. But should you be willing to chase down signatures if that original paperwork never got fully executed? That&#8217;s sort of up to you.</p>
<p>Those, plus dozens of scenarios and situations I&#8217;m forgetting or incapable of imagining. They&#8217;ll all happen over the course of your career. Get out in front of them now, while it&#8217;s (relatively) easy.</p>
<p>Whatever your personal &#8220;lines in the sand&#8221; are, you should take a little time and consider how you&#8217;re going to handle phone calls like the ones above. While you&#8217;re at it, make a note to tighten up your organizational system… never throw anything away… keep an eye on new formats and figure out a strategy for transferring your data on a regular basis as your old media become obsolete.</p>
<p>Because it never ends.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sig-fenoughty1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-632" title="sig-fenoughty" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sig-fenoughty1.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>In a recent <a href="../../../2009/07/how-to-work-on-multiple-projects-and.html">Scorecast article</a> I wrote that I&#8217;ve never turned composing work down that I honestly believe I have the time and the skills to work on.</div>
<div>That was about 2 months ago, right in the middle of practicing what I preached and jumping in the deep end with my organizational (=juggling) skills.</div>
<div>I was already working on several shows back-to-back with <a href="http://www.slunglow.org/">Slung Low</a>, the awesome experimental theatre company that consistently attempts to push the boundaries of theatre whilst still remaining faithful to the notion of a story, a narrative structure. Fun stuff, and pretty well paid, working with lovely people, playing at very prestigious theatre houses. Ticked all the boxes.</div>
<div>I was also booked in solidly every single weekend and most Fridays to play in a string trio for weddings. Summer&#8217;s the busiest time for gigs and these were mostly booked in a year in advance. They are quite hard work and tiring, some of them quite far away and involving a lot of time spent travelling, but it&#8217;s very well paid and the people are, again, really lovely to work with. So this ticks some of the boxes.</div>
<div>I was teaching violin two nights a week too. Not very much mind, only totalling about 4 or 5 hours. This is something I&#8217;ve done for around 7 years now so it was easy work, for ok-ish pay and most of the students worked reasonably hard. One or two boxes ticked, but not high on my list of vocational priorities. The students didn&#8217;t seem to mind when I cancelled lessons for 2 to 3 weeks at a time to fit around composing, so I reasoned with myself that it was win-win.</div>
<div>But then&#8230; da da daaaah! A feature film comes along. A horror, low-but-doable-budget, produced and shot locally. A drama as well. I hadn&#8217;t done one of those before in feature-length form, a massive box to tick! The pay was very good, the story was fun, the director was a sound chap and we were definitely on the same wavelength when it came to the films and music we liked.  Box ticking all round!</div>
<div>So I took on all this work, and I was hideously well-organised. I even delegated a few small elements of sound design and recording to specialists and other people wanting to get credits and a foot-on-the-ladder of working in film.</div>
<div>But I forgot to factor in any time off. At all. From July through to the beginning of August I worked solidly every day from 9 in the morning til at least 7 at night. Some mornings I started at 7am to fit in all of the composition alongside the playing, teaching and admin tasks.</div>
<div>Truth be told, I&#8217;ve never really had to factor it in time off before this year, it just sort of works itself out. There&#8217;ll a few days here and there between small projects where I can catch up on household chores, shop, kick back and read, go for walks, visit friends. So why would I need to schedule it in now?</div>
<div>I&#8217;m also a bit of a productivity freak. I like to think that my mind and body is essentially a machine: if I eat and drink right, all activities in moderation, keep my vulcan-logical-focussed head on, I can accomplish pretty much any task I&#8217;ve set myself. I don&#8217;t have kids so don&#8217;t need to worry about their needs, just me and my boyfriend (who&#8217;s a writer who keeps the same sort of freelance schedule as me, and is fantastically supportive and helpful when I&#8217;m busy busy busy).</div>
<div>But I think I may have pushed it too far. The first sign was where I actually got pretty sick of writing music and started to have fantasies about a 9 til 5, 5 days a week office job. You know. Weekends off, and all that sort of ridiculousness. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></div>
<div>Actually that was a pretty glaring sign that something was up.</div>
<div>I still got the work done. I enjoyed it to a degree when I reminded myself how cool my job was. But it was a conscious effort &#8211; not a natural feeling that made me want to jump out of bed as soon as I woke up &#8211; to keep that in mind.</div>
<div>The work that I created was actually some of the coolest stuff I&#8217;ve written, but I only see that now looking back on it. At the time I, at moments, became so disenchanted that I couldn&#8217;t hear whether or not it was right for the cue, never mind good music.</div>
<div>My first day off after this session of busy busy busy was utter bliss. I took the opportunity to think about how my summer was spent. I&#8217;d written more music in a short amount of time than I ever had before. I&#8217;d several impressive credits to add to the resume. My bank balance looked happier and happier.</div>
<div>But I was absolutely shattered. Bushwacked. Dead-on-my-feet. And I&#8217;d developed some hideous RSI in my right hand from click click clicking that mouse all day long.</div>
<div>Something not quite right here.</div>
<div>A long hard look at my work commitments compared with my life priorities saw a few glaring clashes. Everything I do must lead to me writing music for a living. It&#8217;s the only job I&#8217;m ever completely happy and confident in. It&#8217;s the only career I can ever imagine doing in the long haul.</div>
<div>Which led in turn to a few tricky decisions. The first one was to quit teaching.</div>
<div>Though this wasn&#8217;t, surprisingly, as difficult as I first imagined it would be. Every student was happy for me, and also pleased that I&#8217;d found them alternative tuition that would be more consistent than they&#8217;d been getting all year from me. The teachers that I passed them onto all love teaching and it&#8217;s very much a vocation for them. All very amicable &#8211; score!</div>
<div>As has been said on here many times, film music scoring is a collaborative business, and if you&#8217;re going to make it, you&#8217;ll be doing it with the help of many people behind the scenes. I&#8217;m slowly but surely assembling a team of skilled freelance sound recordists, editors and designers &#8211; that really enjoy their work, and that the credits are useful to &#8211; that I can trust to take on those tasks when I&#8217;ve gotta get my head down on the score.</div>
<div>I&#8217;m also looking into making relationships with orchestrators, bigger recording facilities and contractors along with specialist instrumentalists, so that when it gets hectic again that team is ready in place and ready to go!</div>
<div>There are a couple of other decisions that I&#8217;ll have to deal with eventually, but I&#8217;m going to take them very gradually&#8230; for the sake of my own nerves if anything. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></div>
<div>I&#8217;m also attempting an experiment: to schedule 1 day off a week for recovery, fun and &#8216;sharpening the saw&#8217;. Even that&#8217;s tricky at the moment, and I&#8217;m just about managing 1 day every 2 or 3 weeks at this rate. But it&#8217;s still a step in the right direction and it&#8217;s really making a difference.</div>
<div>It&#8217;s not easy also because this default work habit is so utterly ingrained in every fibre of my being. I&#8217;m still scoring two more awesome shows with Slung Low and playing with the trio. I think there are some other people that I work with on a regular basis who are quite surprised by this paradigm shift in my priorities, and I&#8217;m sensing that it may pee off a few of my colleagues. I can understand their point of view!</div>
<div>But as the one living in my skin I will apologise and, like I attempted with my violin students, hope to make the transition to a new worklife balance as easy and smooth as possible for everyone involved&#8230;</div>
<div>And hopefully, this way, when another one of these fantastic opportunities comes a-knocking, I&#8217;ll have a system and a schedule in place that is free and flexible enough to fit it in comfortably and realistically, not bulging out at the seams.</div>
<div>Or am I being naively unrealistic?</div>
<div>Is what I am trying to achieve beyond the grasp of the jobbing composer simply by the nature of the beast?</div>
<div>Crikey. Hope not. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/08/sig-sanders3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-653" title="sig-sanders" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/08/sig-sanders3.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>As a rule I&#8217;m not a fan of <strong>cold-water </strong>opinion columns. You know the kind: &#8220;Here&#8217;s the hard, bitter truth about [insert choice of profession here].&#8221;</p>
<p>The way I see it, more cold water (cold <em>ink</em>?) is simply unnecessary. You know the long hours required to improve, to get your name out there, to advance in this career. You&#8217;re already aware that the odds of making a decent living as a composer are comparable to the odds of becoming a pro athlete. You know that fame and glamour are overrated; besides, they&#8217;re all but non-existent in our little corner of the music world. And none of that is why you write music anyway. You do it because you have to. There&#8217;s no choice in the matter.</p>
<div>On the other hand, it&#8217;s important to know the terrain. And there I think I can help—although it <em>is</em> going to feel a little… hypothermic… for a while. So let&#8217;s just jump in and get used to it. Then we can start talking about how to swim.</p>
<p>In the year 2009, the value of most television music is <strong>zero</strong> (<em>brrr</em>… chilly). That is to say, if you&#8217;re just starting out (or even if you&#8217;re established!) the kinds of gigs where you can get music placed immediately and actually used on TV no longer pay money up front. You&#8217;ll likely be creating and submitting music library cues—thus, not even writing to picture!—and there will be no front-end compensation for your time, energy, love or gear investment.</p>
<p>I know, because in the last week I&#8217;ve been offered precisely this gig—twice. One e-mail was from a producer on a Top 10 network television show. You&#8217;d know the name if I said it.</p>
<p>This producer actually had the audacity to write: &#8220;Unfortunately we cannot pay any up front money but if we end up using your music in the show you would receive royalties on the back end.&#8221; His reluctance to insert commas makes the sentence read as though he&#8217;s trying to get it all out in one breath—as though if he took the time to breathe, the sheer ridiculousness of what he&#8217;s asking would dawn on him and he&#8217;d delete his request in shame.</p>
<p>Except there&#8217;s no shame here. These offers are being made with a straight face… and to much more experienced and accomplished composers than Yours Truly. So I didn&#8217;t take it personally. I simply referred both these correspondents to a colleague of mine. I&#8217;ve partnered with this particular colleague on a music library project, and every once in a while (when things are slow around our studios) we&#8217;ll kick out a couple of tracks. Over the last several months we&#8217;ve accumulated a pretty decent library as a result… all solid stuff, all completely owned by us and available to license again and again and again.</p>
<p>So, when that lowball network TV offer came in, it required zero energy to deliver to this producer (who is a potential New Contact—crappy deal offer aside, that has value down the road!) the kind of music he needed. High-quality, high-volume, no commitment. My colleague has agreed to handle all the contract stuff and the technical aspects of delivery, and I&#8217;ve agreed that he&#8217;ll get a little more of whatever money the library brings in.</p>
<p>Sad to say the two of us are getting a <em>lot</em> of these kinds of e-mails lately. We&#8217;ve been asked to submit our library to <em>nine shows</em> in the last month alone—and that, my friends, constitutes a <em>trend</em>.</p>
<p>If what I&#8217;ve just described could be seen as a frontal assault on our revenue stream, get ready for more bad news: our rear is also under attack (I know, I know… mixing metaphors: water and warfare. You can handle it). Two cable networks <em>that I know of</em> are attempting to negotiate composer contracts that take away 50% of writer&#8217;s share royalties (presumably assigning them to an entity representing the network, so that the score for their shows are even more of a net money-maker for them). They&#8217;re trying this primarily with less-established composers at present; if they succeed, however, it&#8217;s a safe bet that they&#8217;ll consider this Standard Operating Procedure in future contract negotiations.</p>
<p>Scary stuff. Seriously. Even scarier when you consider that they could take out an ad on Craigslist tomorrow and get hundreds of demo packages from hungry, hopeful composers. If we&#8217;re talking cold water here, this scenario is a scene straight out of <em>Titanic</em>. Post-iceberg.</p>
<div>So how can you survive the squeeze? And what does all of this bad news portend for the future of music in television?</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are a few bright spots. We&#8217;ve talked before (in the comments) about the handful of television shows that still allow for a live orchestra; the fact that those shows are perennial Emmy front-listers bodes well for perceptive producers and network executives. It may be true that, to get on the playing field in the TV music game, you only need to be about a &#8220;five&#8221; on a scale of ten, but the quality difference becomes obvious when it&#8217;s time to hand out little gold statues.</p>
<p>The next bright spot: the proliferation of channels out there. Five hundred channels, and they all need music. In most cases they&#8217;re not willing to pay much, but the opportunities to get at least some experience in the medium has never been greater. If the Industry still contains even a teensy little particle of meritocracy (and I think it does), the sheer volume of music required means that great new composers have a legitimate chance to rise… make connections… get noticed. And move upward and onward to the gigs they deserve.</p>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s important to note that producers and execs for <em>scripted</em> television, particularly in the realm of premium television channels such as HBO, Showtime and others, still care enough to fight for proper composer compensation—and even niceties like reasonable composer schedules. Those producers care about quality, and are still dedicated to the idea that the composer is a key member of the creative team. It&#8217;s a breath of fresh air to take meetings with these people.</p>
<p>But if you really want to &#8220;beat the game&#8221; of shrinking budgets and schedules and command the kind of respect that you&#8217;re due as a composer, here&#8217;s the most important technique I know. Make your network more than just a means to an end. Make your connections your friends. Make &#8217;em your <em>soulmates</em>. Make a real, personal bond with the people who will be hiring you. Do it as part of your long-term strategy… hell, do it as part of making your life better.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why: humans (and, believe it or not, most Hollywood players are, in fact, human—at least on some level) don&#8217;t screw over their friends. They take care of their in-group. Be part of that group.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a great line in an episode of <em>The West Wing</em> (just looked it up: it&#8217;s &#8220;The Black Vera Wang&#8221;) that&#8217;s stuck with me ever since I watched it for the first time: &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk to me like I&#8217;m other people.&#8221; I think that has some resonance here.</p>
<p>Many years ago, I wrote a fan letter to a TV composer. One of the things I asked him—after raving in obsessive detail about his scores—was whether he thought it was possible for someone like me, from the middle of nowhere, to make the trek out to Hollywood and get active in the business. Moreover, I wanted to know whether, with a bit of luck and as much hard work as required, I could expect to make a decent living at this career.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m from a small, solidly middle-class family with no friends or family in the Industry whatsoever. No safety net, no one to serve as a &#8220;rabbi&#8221; and introduce me around. I needed to know whether it was even possible to contemplate before diving in. Would the water simply be too cold—and me without a wetsuit?</p>
<p>The composer replied: &#8220;I think you&#8217;re just the kind of obsessed dreamer who actually has a shot. Eventually it comes down to some luck, but if you pay dues long enough, and if you&#8217;re fairly good, you&#8217;ll find work. And in TV all you need is one hit that goes five seasons and then into syndication. After that you can retire if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to tell you it&#8217;s all still true today, but that last part isn&#8217;t even close. Not anymore. Too much of the cost of creating the music (maintaining a world-class synth rig, mixing, paying for musicians, etc.) has been passed on to us as an ongoing expense, and the squeeze at both front- and back-end has made this career less of a dream and more just something to do for a living.</p>
<p>But like I said: we do it because we have to. That alone should warm up the water… at least a little. Or maybe we composers are just preternaturally fond of the cold.</p>

There&#8217;s nothing for a while, then three projects come along at once.</p>
<p>In the last six months I have been inundated with composing and sound design work for film and theatre and I am constantly thanking my lucky stars. This is exactly what I wanted when I started out many years ago.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<div style="float: right; margin: auto 0px 30px 30px;"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5360077328352690530" style="float: right; margin: 0pt 10px 30px 0pt;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R_A7kO7XEmo/SmLR7mUWQWI/AAAAAAAAACA/02xwteqKs4Y/s320/graphicscore.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">Stay sane in the midst of chaos!</div>
</div>
<p>Just kidding &#8211; of course it is, but on a day-to-day basis it can be a little bit of a challenge to keep the many, many minutes of music flowing, pouring out your heart and soul on demand, whilst maintaining a vague level of sanity.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really, truly and utterly important not to take on too much work. The amount that will make all of your creative efforts suffer and, inevitably, life miserable (plus you&#8217;ll likely get a rep and your success&#8217;ll be pretty short-lived).</p>
<p>But short of that, I&#8217;ve never turned composing work down that I honestly believe I have the time and the skills to work on. This strategy hasn&#8217;t failed me yet <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2>Variety</h2>
<p>The variety of having multiple composing projects on the go is fantastic, and I really do enjoy it. In a way, having several very different works in progress keeps the interest going and staves off staleness. If you do hit a brick wall and are seriously not in the right mindset for one project there&#8217;s always the option of switching around your schedule to work on another.</p>
<h2>Figure out how best you work&#8230;</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re built this way, you can always &#8216;flit&#8217; between tasks, as suggested as a way of working in <a href="../../../2009/01/lee-sanders.html" target="_blank">Lee Sanders&#8217;</a> post <a href="../../../2009/04/so-im-trying-out-this-blog-for-very.html" target="_blank">&#8216;To Flit or Not to Flit&#8217;</a>.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;m a lot more like <a href="../../../2009/05/joe-trapanese.html" target="_blank"> Joe Trapenese</a> in his comment below the aforementioned post &#8211; <span style="font-style: italic;">compartmentalized.</span> I&#8217;m a firm believer that, once the task for the day has been chosen, then being completely immersed in that project and that project alone gets the best music out there.</p>
<p>Getting the music out there on time, to schedule, up to standard, requires focus. 100% concentration on the project at hand. I&#8217;ve found that, without that focus, the work suffers. Turn twitter and email off. If you really need to churn out the notes, turn off your mobile phone (sorry, US readers, cellphone!). Ignore the landline phone, turn off the ringer if you can. Stick a note on your door, &#8216;no interruptions on pain of death!&#8217; And so on, and so on.</p>
<h2>Organize Your Time</h2>
<p>Be ruthlessly organized. Take a little time to plot your schedule realistically. Because I know I work compartmentally, I group specific projects into days, or better still into weeks.</p>
<p>What time of day are you most productive? Are you an <a href="http://www.heather-fenoughty.com/blog/2009/03/20/early-bird-or-night-owl" target="_blank">early bird or a night owl</a>? Schedule your creative and admin tasks accordingly.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prioritize</span><br />
What tasks have you to do that are important (seriously, though, what&#8217;s more important than writing music? ok, ok, family, exercise, blah blah blah <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> )? What&#8217;s urgent? What&#8217;s neither (then why is it on the list? Come on, you gotta write five minutes of music today!)?</p>
<p><a href="http://onstartups.com/home/tabid/3339/bid/8853/Startup-Conversations-With-Myself-What-Should-I-Work-On.aspx" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s a useful post by a chap who&#8217;s struggling with prioritising his tasks</a>. Though it&#8217;s geared towards more general Startup Entrepeneur types, there&#8217;s a lot of relevant points for us busy composers.</p>
<p>You can be seriously anal with this sort of organization if that floats your boat. Back in uni, one of my lecturers recommended that you decide specifically which cues you&#8217;ll compose on which day during your schedule right after the spotting session. You work on that cue on that day until it&#8217;s finished, no matter how long it takes. Conversely, as a reward for finishing a cue earlier than expected, instead of carrying on with the next scheduled cue early, stop work for the day.</p>
<p>Personally, I like to set myself a specific duration of music which has to be written by the end of the working day rather than specific cues. Which allows me the freedom to do a sort of flitting, I suppose, between similar cues, without being completely restricted.</p>
<h2>Task switching</h2>
<p>One thing I&#8217;ve discovered is that it&#8217;s really tricky to switch between composing projects quickly during the same day. Mike Carey, fabulous novel and comic author of various titles for Hellblazer amongst others says that, ideally, sticking to one project-per-day is the ideal formula, and from experience this year I would have to agree. <a href="http://mikeandpeter.com/2009/07/a-whole-lot-of-marvel-stuff%E2%80%A6/comment-page-1/#comment-189" target="_blank">Read his comment here.</a></p>
<p>While it takes maybe 15 minutes or so to get into that &#8216;flow&#8217; state of pure concentration when starting the first composing task of the day, it can take anywhere up to an hour or more to get my head into gear if I have to switch between projects during that same day; the tunes in my head are still from the first project. And that&#8217;s a couple of hours we can ill-afford to waste if there&#8217;s a way around it, by careful planning and blocking of time to ensure the project-per-day rule.</p>
<h2>&#8216;Gateway&#8217; Activity</h2>
<p>But if you&#8217;re really stuffed for time, Mike Carey suggests creating an intentional &#8216;gateway&#8217; activity to switch between projects: re-reading (or listening) to previous completed project-specific work, listening to a piece of music that puts you in the right moodstate, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Heck &#8211; go for a walk or take a nap and really delineate the time between the two projects definitively. This is great, practical, common-sense stuff that really does work.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve recently found leaving a cue deliberately half-finished for the next time I start to work on that project is rather a sneaky way of getting the brain into gear without having to start from that initially difficult &#8216;blank-page&#8217; scenario. I&#8217;ll write a note in a marker on the timeline to myself &#8211; &#8216;fix timing here&#8217;, &#8216;check instrumentation&#8217;, etc. Because that cue appeared to take less time to write than it would have if it had been started from scratch in one sitting, it&#8217;ll have a positive feedback affect and seems to create momentum to push me into the next cue a little bit more easily than had I not gone through this process.</p>
<h2>Get a Head Start</h2>
<p>As much as possible, be involved in the project as early as possible.</p>
<p>This is easier said than done as often, as composers, we have no say in how late in the day we&#8217;re approached to work on a film or other media project. I&#8217;m a firm believer that the subconscious is a much more useful creativity tool than it&#8217;s given credit for, and that the longer I can give it the task to come up with themes and sounds and palettes and tones for a given project the better, without necessarily actually writing a note until final cut.</p>
<p>Which segues nicely onto a sticky subject&#8230; composing to picture before it is locked off.</p>
<p>Love it or hate it, this is generally the reality now: a necessity in these days of dwindling time-scales for post-production sound. All I can say is that, whilst this is a less than ideal scenario, it&#8217;s something to accept, to get used to and try to work to your advantage.</p>
<p>Keep the cues as fluid as possible, simplify your orchestration so that you can keep all the cues in one arrangement file for as long as possible before the computer starts to grind to a halt, and you have to save cues to separate files, and keep in touch with the editor and director to see which edits are likely to remain into the locked cut.</p>
<h2>Delegate</h2>
<p>Spread the love! Dish out the lower-level tasks such as basic sound design, recording (even the cleaning) etc., to someone that costs less for you to pay in terms of money than it would cost for you in time. <a style="font-weight: normal;" href="../../../2009/07/you-need-help-or-do-you-part-i.html" target="_blank">Deane Ogden&#8217;s post here</a> gives way more useful information on this than ever I could!</p>
<h2>In Conclusion&#8230;</h2>
<p>I realise that getting the work through the door is often a tricky enough prospect without worrying about how to juggle several projects at once. However, once you&#8217;re in that situation it&#8217;ll be very useful to have a couple of strategies in place to stay in control&#8230; and still enjoy the process!</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t forget to turn your phone, email and Tweetdeck back on when your done. There may be another project lined up just waiting for you to accept it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: inherit; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;">
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sig-ogden1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-672" title="sig-ogden" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sig-ogden1.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>On the heels of a killer column post from SCOREcast co-host Lee Sanders on Wednesday about &#8220;<a href="../../../2009/07/surviving-crunch.html">Surviving the Crunch</a>&#8220;, James Olszewski asked a very pertinent question:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote style="font-family: inherit;">
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: small;">What do you recommend to develop a passable roadmap on a compressed timeline?&#8230; I&#8217;d like to get a peek at what one of these roadmaps looks like (even if it&#8217;s just scribbles and random notes). Being the &#8220;planner&#8221; I am, I&#8217;m already thinking of some sort of template. Maybe something that takes you progressively from random notes to roadmap to spotting to cue sheet&#8230;. Does anything like that already exist?</span></p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">This is a great question, and one that could be met with as many different answers as there are composers that exercise this practice. In this post, I&#8217;m going to show you a handful of the things that I do in my work that help me achieve a cohesive plan when taking on a new set of visuals to score. Before I do that, though, let&#8217;s define a set of assumed parameters so that we can make sure we are all on the same page.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">I&#8217;m assuming that:</span></div>
<ol style="font-family: inherit;">
<li><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>You are *not* working with a <a class="zem_slink" title="Music editor (filmmaking)" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_editor_%28filmmaking%29">music editor</a>.</strong> A music editor, according to <a class="zem_slink" title="Fred Karlin" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Karlin">Fred Karlin</a>,  is the &#8220;person responsible for all physical details regarding the syncronization of the score with the picture.&#8221; In short, this person is usually involved from the outset of post-production and may be intimately involved with placing temp music into the film, recording and notating the spotting notes at a spotting session between you and the director, and finally, placing and syncronizing the recorded, mixed, and finalized score stems into the film itself for dubbing. Many of the duties handled by an independent film composer (one who is essentially doing it *all* on his/her own) would otherwise be handled by the music editor, thus taking some of the load off the shoulders of the composer and allowing him/her to focus solely on writing and recording the score.
<p></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>You don&#8217;t have a ton of time to write the score.</strong> It&#8217;s becoming pretty typical with any film, but almost certainly with an independent film, we as composers do not have a lot of time to do our jobs when the locked cut is finally handed over. There have even been times for me when I was already on the scoring stage on an indie film and here comes Mr. Director with a new cut that nobody but him and the editor knew about until&#8230; now.
<p></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>You don&#8217;t have a ton of money in the music budget.</strong> Duh! Helllooooo! Money in the post-production budget for music on an independent film? What in the hell is that?
<p></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>You have adequately immersed yourself in the material.</strong> As a competent composer, you have to develop the discipline of <em>getting under</em> the material so that you have a solid understanding of the story&#8217;s arc at a core level. Try for a second to understand the difference between &#8220;scoring <em>through</em> a film&#8221; versus simply &#8220;scoring a film&#8221;. There is a huge difference, and a lot of the difference comes from your ability to get the material into your headspace either through the script, the concept drawings or storyboards, or the locked cut. Bottom line: You must have enough of a love of the characters in your story to warrant you being trusted with them for this period of time. If you don&#8217;t care, your music will tattle on you — I promise!<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">So, assuming all of those — or at least one or two of them — are in place, here are some things I do when I am roadmapping a score to insure that I don&#8217;t get too far ahead of myself before realizing that I should have taken &#8220;that left toyn at Albuquerque.&#8221;</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>ORGANIZE YOUR LOGISTICS</strong><br />
Let&#8217;s first define what we are hired to do: <strong><em>Write music</em></strong>. That&#8217;s it. Nothing more, nothing less. We are the music people. However, we all know that there are way more things involved in scoring for a feature than just simply writing the music, don&#8217;t we? There are probably hundreds of little tiny nagging tasks that must be done daily in our studios in order than we might concentrate fully on writing score. I&#8217;m talking about phone calls, emails, notes, mailings, <a class="zem_slink" title="File Transfer Protocol" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">FTP</a> deliveries, invoicing, etc. Those all fall into what I would consider only one single set of administrative duties.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">The other set consists of things that are directly related to the main task of writing the music: Spotting the film; organizing spotting notes; keeping track of reel splits; scheduling live sessions; notating edit changes; interfacing with music editors, recording engineers, and mixers; and, last but certainly not least, keeping track of how much music you have left to write and how much time you have to write it in.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><em><strong>Cue Log Manager and Cue Chronicle</strong></em><br />
Luckily, there are a couple of killer software programs that can handle that entire last paragraph for you. The first one is a little number called <em><strong>Cue Log Manager (CLM)</strong></em>. CLM is a <a class="zem_slink" title="FileMaker" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileMaker">Filemaker Pro</a> database application that allows you to keep track of a film score, television score, or game score project from spotting to delivery. It was developed by Dino Herrmann and Daniel Hamuy, the team behind the popular &#8220;Powerkeys&#8221; DAW add-on.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: inherit; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"><a style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm12M4soB1I/AAAAAAAAAeE/NTPT2blbtBA/s1600-h/Picture+17.png"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm12M4soB1I/AAAAAAAAAeE/NTPT2blbtBA/s320/Picture+17.png" border="0" alt="" /></a></span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">I use CLM everyday in my studio and I like it for its clean layout, easy to understand functionality, and ability (through Filemaker) to put on a shared server and run with all of my workstations in my studio, enabling them to access to the most up-to-date info on where we are on projects. CLM features a simple layout which includes several &#8220;screensets&#8221; to work from, beginning with the Project Database. </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">The Project Database is an                  overall view of your project which enables you to track the status                  of each cue in the project. You can see if each cue has been composed,                  approved, orchestrated, recorded or which musician already recorded                  in each cue. </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">You can label your cues by usage, description, genre or style                  fields to help identify them within the project, and you can also </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">track                  multiple ensembles (orchestra, band, jazz trio, etc), as well as oversee </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">a detail view of what cues will be recorded                  in which session. The database will automatically calculate                  how many minutes of music need to be recorded per session, providing for you all of the information necessary to then organize the session more efficiently. CLM also allows                  for multiple sessions per day, as well as a great &#8220;Change                  Session Date&#8221; script that makes changing the date and time                  of a session and its related cues a snap.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><em>Cue Log Manager</em> also acts as a &#8220;Virtual Music Editor&#8221;, giving you the ability to </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">dynamically create Spotting Notes, Summary Sheets                  and Cue Sheets for your project as it evolves. The <em>spotting notes</em> feature displays start times, stop times,                  length, usage and a short description of each cue as well as length                  totals; the <em>summary sheet</em> option provides a quick overview of all                  the cues in a project and their length and usage; and the <em>cue list</em> page shows a list of each cue in a project with                  all the composer and publisher information as well as length and                  usage, serving as a worksheet for Performing                  Royalty Organizations (such as ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC) cue sheets.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><em>Cue Log Manager</em> is available for Apple computers running Filemaker Pro 8 or 9 in at least Mac OS 10.3.9. It retails online at the <a href="http://www.powerkeys.com/cuelogmanager.html">Powerkeys website</a> for $89 US.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><em><strong>Cue Chronicle</strong></em>, invented by Hollywood ProTools recordist Vincent Cirilli, is also worth taking a look at. <em>Cue Chronicle</em> differs greatly from Cue Log Manager in that it is offerred both as a Filemaker database and also as a standalone runtime application. It is also offers two unique and smart ways to license the application, which I&#8217;ll explain in a minute.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: inherit; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"><a style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm18IQ4vNkI/AAAAAAAAAeM/s0BjOd3lcT8/s1600-h/clistv3.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm18IQ4vNkI/AAAAAAAAAeM/s0BjOd3lcT8/s320/clistv3.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">Built certainly more with larger format studio scoring sessions in mind, </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><em>Cue Chronicle (CC)</em> is extensively more user definable than Cue Log Manager because of the way that Vinnie has created it. CC&#8217;s database is hugely modular which enables the entire app to function like a &#8220;central nervous system&#8221; for your scoring projects, including whole workspaces devoted soley to indivudual aspects of a scoring project like <em>crew</em>, <em>rigs</em>, <em>drives</em>, <em>reels</em>, <em>contacts</em>, and <em>notes</em>. The vast toolbox of checklists and itemizable charts include important variables such as version tracking, revision tracking, timing changes, takes, tracksheets for recording, and orchestral breakdown with a deep section allowing you to list and keep track of your instrumentation per cue. Everything is color-coded to make it easy to see and simple to monitor at quick glance, and with many fields user-definable, <em>Cue Chronicle</em> makes it pretty difficult to run out of ways to sort content.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">While Cue Log Manager utilizes a simple challenge and response licensing scheme, <em>Cue Chronicle</em> gives you a choice to tether your license to a particular machine in your studio OR tether the license to a USB memory stick enabling you to travel with the license and software from studio to studio, stage to stage. Pretty handy.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><em>Cue Chronicle</em> is available from <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/vcirilli/CueChronicle/index.html">Vincent Cirrilli&#8217;s website</a> and is downloadable for $295 US. It runs on Apple PPC or Intel computers running OS 10.4 and higher, and the optional Filemaker Pro v8 (v9 recommended).<br />

<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>FINDING YOUR &#8220;SPOT&#8221;</strong><br />
When I was just getting started, the biggest problem I had with scoring a film from beginning to end was knowing where the best places were to put music. I was never quite sure early on if I was placing music in the film where the music should *really* be placed, or if I was just sort of guessing as best I could with no real idea of what I was doing. It took me awhile to get really great at spotting. The big problem for me was that I had a very difficult time seeing the entire score as a representative whole from top to bottom. When I would work, I would start writing whichever cue was calling me at the time, not really paying much attention to what I was doing in terms of continuity and sequence. At the end of writing the score, I would invariably end up forgetting something in the thrid or the fourth reel and then having to go back and write what I should have remembered to do while I was there the first time! It was very hard for me to see the overall &#8220;big picture&#8221; when I was needing to be so tunnel-visioned into what I was doing.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">If you have issues with not knowing whether or not you are covering everything you need to cover in your scores, or if you are having trouble spotting things on your own, let me offer this as a tip that might help get you thinking about how spotting can help you, and not scare you. You might have seen directors use this method that I am going to describe, but I learned it from an editor that I once worked with that has been using the method of storyboarding on <em><strong>Post-It Notes</strong></em> for the vast majority of his career.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">The idea of the <em>Post-It Note Score Storyboard</em> is to take a section of a wall in your writing room (as big a section as you can part with) and use it sort of as a big huge &#8220;map&#8221; for the storyline, characters, and arc of the film in relation to the musical cues that you will write to coalese with those points on your &#8220;map&#8221;. If you&#8217;ve ever watched or seen a director storyboard a camera shot, then you already know what I am talking about. Its not so much about storyboarding the musicality of a cue as much as it is about storyboarding the cue itself in the timeline of the film&#8217;s story arc.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">Start by taking a stack of standard canary yellow Post-It Notes and writing on each note a single event in the film that you feel is pivotal. &#8220;KISS&#8221; would be the key here: Keep It Simple! On one note you might write the words, &#8220;First Day/Harry Gets Up&#8221;. Another might say, &#8220;Car Won&#8217;t Start&#8221;. Yet another might say, &#8220;Julianne Misses Her Bus&#8221;. Be <em>specific</em> and be <em>generous</em> — you can always get rid of the events that you won&#8217;t write cues for, but once you have evrything up in the timeline, it will be hard to add events without moving all of the subsequent events down the line to compensate.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: inherit; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"><a style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm2HISzz2rI/AAAAAAAAAec/blm8YqBMJoU/s1600-h/warroom09.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm2HISzz2rI/AAAAAAAAAec/blm8YqBMJoU/s200/warroom09.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">Arrange these canary yellow &#8220;timeline&#8221; notes on the wall, left to right, in the sequence in which they occur as the film plays out. After you are finished, you should have a visual representation of the film&#8217;s timeline made up of yellow Post-It Notes.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">After you have the whole film represented with the canary yellow notes, take another stack of Post-Its that is a decidely different color from the yellow ones you just used to timeline the film. Maybe these are going to be Hot Pink. Designate these Hot Pink notes as the &#8220;cues&#8221; of your score. Take yet <em>another</em> set of a different color (green, orange, blue, purple&#8230; whatever floats your boat!) and make that your &#8220;Theme&#8221; color. Take a third set of a different color still and make these your &#8220;Motif&#8221; notes. You get the picture.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">Then, loosely decide (because I promise, you&#8217;ll change your mind about twenty million times!) where to put the hot pink CUE notes on the yellow timeline. Once that set has been exhausted, grab your THEME color and place those over the CUE notes where you think a main theme or character theme would be nice. After that, take you MOTIF color and place some of those over the THEME notes where you think your <em>Main Motif</em> might work nicley and communicate what&#8217;s happening in a scene. Pretty soon, after a lot of going back and forth, sticking and unsticking, moving and shuffling, you&#8217;ll have a fairly decent jumping-off point in which to begin scoring your new feature.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">Use this method to really experiment and try stuff you don&#8217;t think you should try! Often, those are the happiest of accidents and sometimes end up being the catalysts by which inspiration is born&#8230; and Oscars are awarded!</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">These are only a couple of ideas I have to get you thinking about your workflow and how maybe you can either make it more efficient (Cue Log Manager or Cue Chronicle) or dance outside the fire a bit with regards to how you plan your scores (Post-It Note spotting). I&#8217;d like to hear your ideas for mixing up your workflow in your studios and writing rooms&#8230;.</span></div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having worked along side composers like <a class="zem_slink" title="Hans Zimmer" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001877/" rel="imdb">Hans Zimmer</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="Graeme Revell" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006251/" rel="imdb">Graeme Revell</a>, and more recently <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0413011/">Steve Jablonski</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0340003/">Rupert Gregson-Williams</a>, and SCOREcast founder <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1676420/">Deane Ogden</a>, I&#8217;ve gleaned much by watching how the big boys do it. One thing I&#8217;ve noticed about the really successful composers — They are all <span style="font-style: italic;">healthy</span>. Hans Zimmer rarely gets sick. If he does, it is the kind of sick that is over in a day, and I&#8217;ve never seen it cost him anything in terms of down time. Same with my current composer, SCOREcast founder Deane Ogden. When Deane first hired me, one of the first things he told me was to &#8220;stay healthy. We are no good to each other if we are on our backs.&#8221;</p>
<p>How do you stay healthy in the studio? It is possible, and most of it has to do with what we are talking about this month: Workflow. Even though you are sitting for the majority of it, life in the studio can be back-breaking work. Any environment where you are spending 14+ hours a day needs to be set up in a way that accomodates a relaxing workflow&#8230; one that helps, not hinders.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent an incredible amount of carefully thought out time and energy planning and conceptualizing my studio layout for one reason: I don&#8217;t want to get hurt. I have worked in some very nice situations in this town as a scoring assistant, witnessing first-hand the most comfortable studios that money can buy along with some of the most poorly laid out studios one could imagine. I know guys that have horrible back problems that stem from sitting in cheap chairs for days. I have seen many composers have to start wearing glasses because of the activity of assailing their eyesight with poorly color-calibrated monitors while trying to get music written. Orchestrator Susie Benchasil said in a SCOREcast <a href="../../../2009/05/scorecast-no19-shownotes.html">interview</a> once that she knows a lot of people in the business that have issues of poor circulation due to simply not moving their legs enough and sitting on their posteriors for days at a time with little to no physical activity happening. Composing, it seems, can be hazardous to your health, so it&#8217;s no surprise that any composer worth his or her salt will tell you that <span style="font-style: italic;">health</span> is of optimum concern in the studio. In fact, at my old stomping grounds of Remote Control, a mandate was handed down by the Lion King himself that every composer use the same brand of desk. Hans believed that a particular desk from a particular company kept back fatigue to a minimum, so everyone was supplied with one, whether they liked it or not.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time watching how pro composers do things when I get invited into their &#8220;inner sanctums&#8221;. That is a rare treat and I never want to squander the opportunity. Since not having to re-invent the wheel is priceless knowledge to have, I&#8217;ll attempt to outline a few of the things that I&#8217;ve picked up along the way. It might take me a few posts to get in everything that I want to, but I&#8217;ll get it done. We&#8217;ll call this the first in a series for this month from me.</p>
<h1>Musical Chairs</h1>
<p>In our studio, Deane and I listen to a lot of podcasts. When we are wiring, assembling demos, or some other menial task that doesn&#8217;t require us speaking to each other for lengths at a time, we listen to what others are doing in various fields and try to apply those new ideas to our own craft, if applicable. We recently heard <a class="zem_slink" title="Stephen King" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King" rel="wikipedia">Stephen King</a> say that he likens &#8220;writing in your studio to &#8216;creative sleep&#8217;.&#8221; What he meant by that is this: Everything in your bedroom is engineered to help you fall asleep so you can dream. It&#8217;s dark, the doors are locked, and the temperature is right. The pillows are the perfect softness, and comforter is just the right thickness, and the bed doesn&#8217;t have any lumps in it. Your studio should be the same way. When you close the door to your writing space, you should now be completely free of any discomforts so that you may &#8220;dream&#8221; the right score for the film.</p>
<p>The cornerstone to making this happen is the chair you are sitting in. You are in your chair for up to 14 hours a day, so you need to have one that is not good, but <span style="font-style: italic;">great</span>. Your task chair is not something you want to be cheap about, believe me. It is one of those things where you are either going to pay now, or pay later. But you <span style="font-style: italic;">will</span> pay. (Preferably in the form of dollars to a place that sells chairs and not dollars to a chiropractor!)</p>
<p>Your chair should be first of all, sturdy. These chairs that you see at places like Staples and Office Depot — those aren&#8217;t going to work. In the office furniture business, there is a lingo&#8230; much like what we have as composers. There are chairs that are specifically designed for &#8220;tasking&#8221;, and this is a paraphrase, but it basically means &#8220;jobs that are done while hunched over a workstation desk&#8221;. That&#8217;s us! When searching for the right chair for your studio, you want to be looking specifically for a &#8220;task chair&#8221;.</p>
<p>My advice would be to look at two &#8220;task chair&#8221; companies: Steel Case and Herman Miller.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/global">Herman Miller</a> is what Deane and Lee both use in their studios. At Deane&#8217;s place, we have a couple of Herman Miller <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/Products/Aeron-Chairs">Aeron Chairs</a>. These chairs are the bomb.</p>
<div class="zemanta-img zemanta-action-dragged" style="display: block; float: right; margin: 1em; width: 310px;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Aeron_chair_JN.jpg"><img style="display: block;" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ec/Aeron_chair_JN.jpg/300px-Aeron_chair_JN.jpg" alt="Aeron chair" width="300" height="321" /></a>Image via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Aeron_chair_JN.jpg">Wikipedia</a></div>
<p>They are a little expensive, but again, you cannot skimp on this part of your studio. Remember what I said: You&#8217;ll either pay the price now or pay the price later. Your choice. Aeron Chairs are completely adjustable and come in several different sizes. They also have one of the best warrantes in the business and Herman Millr is a trusted name in seating and has been for decades. This is not some fly-by-night mom-and-pop that will be gone tomorrow. HM chairs are everywhere — even <a class="zem_slink" title="Donald Trump" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump" rel="wikipedia">Donald Trump</a> sits in one!</p>
<p>Herman Miller also makes a chair called the <a href="http://www.ultimatebackstore.com/product-exec/product_id/351/pn/Celle_Chair_-_Quick_Ship">Celle Chair</a>. Celle Chairs are less expensive than the Aeron Chair, but provide many of the same features such as adjustable lumbar support and adjustable armrests. The major difference between the two is that the Celle lacks the <span style="font-style: italic;">total</span> adjustability that the Aeron Chair is famous for, but if you don&#8217;t need that or you are fairly average sized, the Celle will work great for you. Plus, it is considerably less money — about $400 for a brand new Celle Chair.</p>
<p>I get Deane&#8217;s HM chairs from a company in Chicago called The Ultimate Back Store. These guys often have great deals on HM products and sometimes even have floor models they&#8217;ll sell for less, but still have the same warranty as a brand new one. They also will ship the chair for free and have service centers that will come to your studio and fix the chair should anything ever break or go wrong. (When does THAT happen ever?)</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Herman Miller Task Chairs</span><br />
Fully adjustable, comes in various sizes to fit your body type, 12-year &#8220;no-fault&#8221; warranty<br />
Price range: $400 USD (Celle) -$700 USD (Aeron)<br />
<a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/global">Herman Miller.com</a><br />
<a href="http://www.ultimatebackstore.com/">The Ultimate Back Store</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.steelcase.com/">Steel Case</a> is also another company that makes amazing task chairs. Their <a href="http://www.steelcase.com/na/leap_products.aspx?f=11852">Leap Chair</a> is a favorite at several studios I&#8217;ve worked in like Capitol Records and the Power Station in New York (which is wh<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fZp_xxfyktg/SlTTHGpP-OI/AAAAAAAAABo/E4AFclokJRw/s1600-h/steelcase.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5356137975846533346" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 203px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 203px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fZp_xxfyktg/SlTTHGpP-OI/AAAAAAAAABo/E4AFclokJRw/s320/steelcase.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>ere I first sat in one). They are a little more expensive than the Herman Miller Aeron Chair, coming in at around $850, but they are well worth the money and come with a full lifetime warranty.</p>
<p>Steel Case also makes a handful of other models that sport several other configurations to accomodate both your price range and feature set requirements. I would suggest checking out their company website to see what they have to offer. The Ultimate Back Store also carries Steel Case, and as the Herman Miller stuff, they regularly offer floor models for sale at heavy discounts. The best thing to do with UBS is call them and talk to a human being. They are great to deal with.</p>
<p>Steel Case is a great alternative to Herman Miller on many levels, especially price.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Steel Case Task Chairs</span><br />
Fully to semi-adjustable, comes in various sizes to fit your body type, limited lifetime warranty<br />
Price range: $300 USD (Uno) &#8211; $900 USD (Leap)<br />

<p>So, obviously there a hundred different ways to go with a task chair, and these are only two of my favorites. Of course your studio has certain requirements that we don&#8217;t have in Deane&#8217;s studio — every space is different. Maybe you turn to the side to play your keyboard controller or perhaps it is centered under your desk in front of you. Maybe you use an outboard mixing console, so you need to be able to &#8220;Alex Keaton&#8221; your way across the room and roll to where your outboard rig is set up.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, your chair is the epicenter of your whirlwind. It has to be great, not just <span style="font-style: italic;">good</span>. It will be the one piece of gear that sustains you over time and keeps you from pain.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/sig-sanders2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-694" title="sig-sanders" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/06/sig-sanders2.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>A beginning is a delicate time… or so I&#8217;ve heard. So I want to begin my column here on SCOREcast with what I&#8217;m going to try to cover—which is nearly everything—and a few words about my plan of attack.</p>
<p>I like to work &#8220;big to small.&#8221; In other words, I try to start with the overarching concept, and then work out the details as I go. That way, if I&#8217;ve omitted anything, you have the larger context, and can figure out the details yourself. If you&#8217;re cool with that, read on…</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s Big Picture has to do with self-assessment, and it&#8217;s a metaphor from (American) football: coaches talk about their teams&#8217; performance in terms of <span style="font-style: italic;">phases of the game</span>. In football, the three phases are offense, defense and special teams (like kicking field goals or returning punts).</p>
<p>A coach might say: &#8220;We dominated the offensive phase of the game today. But we got beat on special teams, and those twelve field goals (!) they scored really hurt us.&#8221; What he&#8217;s saying is that his team had a critical <span style="font-style: italic;">imbalance</span>—one facet of their performance wasn&#8217;t up to standard. And the team&#8217;s overall game suffered as a result.</p>
<p>Football teams that excel in one phase of the game can win individual contests; they might even beat a particular opponent regularly (they &#8220;match up well&#8221; against a certain defense, e.g.). Teams that are strong in every phase of the game, though… those teams have the potential to become legend.</p>
<p>So it is with us as composers. We&#8217;re talking about diversity this month, and I think a good way to approach this topic is to look at our own diversity. What are we great at? Where do our skills fall down? How can we target our efforts to improve?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Here&#8217;s a little quiz:</span> rate yourself from one to five in each area. A one indicates little or no experience; a five is world-class mastery. Be honest—no one&#8217;s looking at this but you. I&#8217;ve picked areas that I&#8217;ve found to be important in my own career; your mileage may vary, but I doubt it&#8217;ll vary by much.</p>
<p>Some of the &#8220;phases of the game&#8221; I&#8217;m including below are crucial; others are merely <span style="font-style: italic;">important</span> from time to time or if you&#8217;re wanting to break into a certain area of the biz. The quiz is primarily aimed at composers, though many of the topics apply to anyone in our crazy little corner of the music world.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve taken the quiz, rate yourself. You&#8217;ve created a snapshot of your skill set—and now you can analyze that data. What does the graph of your skill set look like? How would you like it to look in six months… a year… five years? What&#8217;s the best way to get there?</p>
<p>You may decide to play to your strengths by beefing up the phases in which you&#8217;re already strong… or shore up those phases where you aren&#8217;t. That&#8217;s up to you. I hope this tool will be valuable, though, no matter where you find yourself in your career.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Music composiiton: Plain ol&#8217; tonal harmony</span><br />
1. Piano sound pretty! Sometimes…<br />
2. I have a basic understanding of scales and simple common practice period harmonization.<br />
3. I can perform a Roman-numeral analysis of, say, a Bach chorale.<br />
4. Secondary dominants, predominant chords and chromaticism are familiar territory to me.<br />
5. Tonality is my playground—to be used or transcended at will.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Music composition: Advanced harmony/modern techniques</span><br />
1. Um, why are all those ugly notes in there?<br />
2. I&#8217;ve studied a few serial and atonal works, and can &#8220;think in octatonic&#8221; or other scale forms.<br />
3. Alternate tunings and notations; minimalism; musique concrete… I&#8217;m cool with all that.<br />
4. I&#8217;m just as comfortable writing outside the tonal system as I am working within it.<br />
5. The full range of sonic expression is at my fingertips. I&#8217;m involved in creating what comes next.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Music composition: Contemporary</span><br />
1. Who is this Diddy of which you speak?<br />
2. I can crank out a lead sheet.<br />

5. Whatever a client needs, I can deliver—regardless of style.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Orchestration</span><br />
1. Hey, the big instruments play lower! Handy to remember, huh?<br />
2. I know the instrumental families and have a pretty good grasp of ranges.<br />
3. I understand balance and blend, and know the idiomatic tendencies of most standard instruments.<br />
4. Orchestration is an integral, instinctual part of my process from the moment I conceive a musical idea.<br />
5. I could teach Ravel a thing or two.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Conducting</span><br />
1. Floor, wall, wall, ceiling… but what if the cue is in 3/4?<br />
2. I know basic conducting patterns and recording session protocol.<br />
3. I&#8217;m comfortable at the podium, conducting for a variety of ensembles and/or styles.<br />
4. My skills and experience allow me to interpret a performance—not just survive it—regardless of the musical terrain.<br />
5. I am a professional conductor.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mixing</span><br />

4. My mixes are an expression of my musical opinion and personality, executed with the same control as the writing itself.<br />
5. I&#8217;m a full-time professional mixer.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Performance</span><br />

5. I&#8217;m a full-time professional musician.</p>

1. I haven&#8217;t really started thinking about my own studio. I have a computer, but no other gear.<br />
2. I can use my computer to record sound. Not that it&#8217;s sound someone would pay actual money for (yet…).<br />
3. I have a functioning home studio, but I&#8217;d like to expand in order to get a better sound.<br />
4. My home/project studio is more than simply adequate—it&#8217;s a resource, and sometimes an inspiration.<br />
5. Those guys at Remote Control… they&#8217;re cool and all, but they need more gear.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gear: Library</span><br />
1. You mean people sell sounds? That you can buy? Weird!<br />
2. I have a basic set of samples, but nothing fancy or exotic.<br />

4. I can call up pretty much any sound I need, in nearly any style I&#8217;d be asked to write.<br />
5. If it&#8217;s out there, I own it. If it&#8217;s not out there yet, I&#8217;m probably beta-testing it.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gear: Expertise</span><br />
1. I know where the ON switch is, but I&#8217;m a little afraid to start pushing buttons.<br />
2. Where&#8217;s that manual again? I&#8217;m digging in, but have a lot to learn.<br />
3. I can run my gear with no problem, but some of the power-user commands are a mystery.<br />
4. I have my own macros/custom key bindings for sequencing, and each piece of gear is optimized for my work flow.<br />
5. I build my own electronic gear and/or work as a developer for a manufacturer.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Film Music History</span><br />
1. Buncha old guys wrote some tunes. What&#8217;s the big deal?<br />
2. I know the basic history of the art form, and a few of the &#8220;big names.&#8221;<br />
3. I&#8217;ve listened to numerous scores from across the decades, and have a working knowledge of film music history.<br />
4. I&#8217;ve written (term papers count) about multiple film composers, studied scores old and new, and can identify style and approximate historical period from a &#8220;needle-drop.&#8221;<br />
5. Bring it on, Tony Thomas… I am a veritable Film Music History encyclopedia.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Film History</span><br />
1. Nouvelle vague… emphasis on the vague.<br />

3. I&#8217;ve studied the basics of the history of cinema around the world.<br />
4. I&#8217;ve done in-depth research and/or read widely in the field. I might even own some Rohmer-era issues of Cahiers du cinéma.<br />
5. I can pontificate for hours about the relative merits of, say, Huang Jianxin versus Wong Kar-wai.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Film Terminology</span><br />
1. Words of the day: Director, camera, movie.<br />
2. Dutch angle, cinematographer, pickups.<br />
3. Slug line, walla, cigarette burns.<br />

5. Abby Singer, diegesis, zoopraxis.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Organization</span><br />

2. I have reasonably good interpersonal skills.<br />
3. People say I&#8217;m a good hang… and it doesn&#8217;t mean they want to hang me.<br />

5. It&#8217;s like there&#8217;s an aura around me. I am an &#8220;it&#8221; machine.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Team-Building</span><br />
1. Pee Wee Herman said it best: &#8220;I&#8217;m a loner, Dottie. A rebel.&#8221;<br />
