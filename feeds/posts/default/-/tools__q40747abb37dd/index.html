Inside, you’re instantly presented with the sheets to which you have access rights, and you start working.  It’s pretty intuitive.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLet’s think about the implications of being “in the cloud”.  In the past, if you wanted to use personal computers to construct a distributed collaboratorium involving several individuals, you had to make sure they all had the same software on their computers.  If the collaborators were independent contractors, each would have had to purchase and install his or her own copy of any software needed.  You would have had to ensure that each collaborator owned a sufficiently compatible computer with adequate horsepower.  And then there could be a steep learning curve.  All of these factors would have been expense issues and coordination nightmares – which would have served as a barriers to ever getting the team together and off the ground.  The idea of instant, effortless, low-cost, Internet-enabled collaboration would have been little more than a wistful dream.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut with cloud-based collaboration using \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSmartSheet\u003c/span\u003e, most of these barriers evaporate.  All each collaborator needs is a low-cost laptop or netbook computer capable of running a modern web browser (and it doesn’t have to be the same browser on each individual’s computer).  Mobile device fans can even connect via their smartphones when on the move.  It’s literally true that if you’ve thought through your collaboration and project tracking methodology and have instrumented it in terms of a set of \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esmart sheet\u003c/span\u003e templates, you can choose team members, invite them into your collaboratorium (by means I’ll explain below), and tie them together within a matter of hours or maybe even minutes, with very little learning curve and \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ezero \u003c/span\u003eincremental buy-in cost on the part of invitees.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNotice that these benefits are \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ein addition to\u003c/span\u003e the most basic advantage of \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eany \u003c/span\u003escheme for collaborating over the web:  namely, that the members of your team can be distributed geographically – even across the globe – or, can be in the same room.  This means new flexibility in how you think about team formation and professional relationships.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eThe Benefit Of Sourcing Documents From The Cloud\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLet’s return for a moment to the fact that sharing project documents over the web is central to the way collaboration and project tracking are instrumented when using \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSmartSheet\u003c/span\u003e.  But how does storing these documents in the cloud and sourcing them to team members from the cloud improve sharing?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSharing documents might not seem like such a big deal at first, especially for computer-based documents.  You think,\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003e of course I’m going to share my documents with my team members, just like I always have\u003c/span\u003e.  And then you think:  \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eany time I revise a document, I’ll just send a copy of the updated document file to each team member, right?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere’s a potential problem with this thinking.  If a separate copy of a document resides on each team member’s computer, and the document is subject to change (especially if it can be changed frequently or by more than one person), the possibility arises that different team members can find themselves inadvertently working with \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003edifferent versions\u003c/span\u003e of the document.  In other words, team members can get out of sync with one another.  What could make this happen?  \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eScore changes, \u003c/span\u003eof course!  In today’s film music world, late changes – even up to the last minute – are an increasing risk.  Why?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWell, in the pre-digital age, a much less automated post-production technology meant that late-stage changes to picture or dialog caused unacceptable disruption that could delay final release, with adverse financial impact.  To avoid such disruptions, it used to be that \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003epicture lock\u003c/span\u003e was put into effect far earlier than it is now, relative to the targeted release date.  The lengthy time allowed for post-production let the start of film music work be postponed until picture lock, and thus composers could usually rely on working against stable picture.  But today, computers and digital technologies have drastically accelerated post-production, such that directors can (and often do) keep tweaking their films until much closer to the scheduled release date than before.  In contrast, the process of composing and producing film music \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ehasn’t \u003c/span\u003eaccelerated to the same degree.  The result is that music development is increasingly exposed to late dramatic and timing changes that require cues to be re-worked.  Cue revisions mean that documents supporting the music development process are being changed.  And, as I’ve pointed out, one of the ways a rush of changes can lead to chaos sand lost time is by causing inconsistencies to emerge between the versions of documents that different team members have.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut with \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSmartSheet \u003c/span\u003eand similar cloud-based document-sharing technologies, the idea is that team members \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003edon’t\u003c/span\u003e send copies of documents, revised or otherwise, to one another.  Instead, a \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esingle copy\u003c/span\u003e of each document (a \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esmart sheet\u003c/span\u003e) is stored in the cloud.  All team members work with that single copy – which reflects the latest revision status – within the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSmartSheet \u003c/span\u003eon-line environment.  In this way, the emergence of conflicting document versions is avoided – and with it, the associated chaos.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eEven better – although \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSmartSheet \u003c/span\u003ealways shows you (or any team member) the latest version of a document, it also shows you at a glance \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ewhat’s recently changed\u003c/span\u003e – information that could easily be overlooked with conventional documents.

However, many or most film music enterprises are probably small enough that there need be only one sheet creator.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo, it all starts with an entrepreneurially-motivated individual – most likely the composer, who is typically at the head of his or her film music enterprise.  That person opens one of several types of paid accounts with \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esmartsheet.com\u003c/span\u003e.  There is a monthly (or annual) fee (as little as $8.50 a month for the most basic account), which entitles the payer to be a sheet creator and provides an \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eallotment of sheets\u003c/span\u003e.

Call it what you like – the sentiment is the same. We’re all participating in the rise of a global, ubiquitous platform for computation and collaboration that is reshaping nearly every aspect of human affairs. While the old Web was about Web site, clicks, and “eyeballs,” the new Web is about communities, participation, and peering. As users and computing power multiply, and easy-to-use tools proliferate, the Internet is evolving into a global, living, networked computer that anyone can program. Even the simple act of participating in an online community makes a contribution to the new digital commons….” (Tapscott, 19)\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOne of the greatest advancements in the Internet since it opened up to the public back in the 90s is the evolution from the publish-and-read Web to the collaborative Web – I call it “Web 2.0”. SCOREcast Online fits squarely into the spirit of Web 2.0. We are a community of composers and other music-for-media professionals engaging this site not only because of our love of the art and we want to read some cool stuff, but also to participate with one another – to network and work together on actual, real-world projects. We never would have been able to do this if not for Web 2.0 and the “proliferation of collaboration tools”. Nowhere, I believe, in the music-for-media composing community is the Web 2.0 benefit felt more keenly than in those that are just getting started, and/or those living outside Los Angeles, CA.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs one of these composers, (I wouldn’t consider myself “just starting out” for much longer, but I do live outside of LA) I have my list of favorite tools to collaborate with my fellow musical colleagues.

I love that word. The list below is not necessarily in any particular order, but I’m instead leaving it in the order I originally thought of the list. So if nothing else, you could say this list is in order of “top of my mind” for collaboration with filmmakers, composers, and the like. I will say though that, I’ve not had a chance to use some of these tools, but in my research over time, these are the ones that looked the most promising. I’ll note whether I’ve used each tool below; for those I haven’t used yet, I leave it to you to speak up in the COMMENTS section to rant or rave.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDropbox \u003c/strong\u003e(\u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.getdropbox.com/\"\u003ehttp://www.getdropbox.com/\u003c/a\u003e) – Dropbox is just plain cool and is my current #1 favorite collaboration utility. Say you’re working with another composer on a project. You finish your part of the cue, mix it down to a .wav file, and you want to get it to your partner asap. With Dropbox, all you have to do is drag the file over to a special “Dropbox” folder in your “My Documents” folder (or wherever else you choose). As soon as you drop the file there, Dropbox takes over in the background and copies it to whoever else is connected to your Dropbox. Translation- in practically real-time, your partner notices a new file is appearing magically in his Dropbox folder on his computer- your new .wav file. Maybe he grabs it and makes changes, copying it back to his Dropbox. The app notices the change and copies the file back to you, notifying you of the change. Faster and more transparent than email, less trouble than FTP – it just works. The first 2GB of storage space is free, with more storage available for a fee.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFacebook\u003c/strong\u003e (\u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.facebook.com/\"\u003ehttp://www.facebook.com/\u003c/a\u003e) – Facebook is maybe the most ubiquitous of the Web 2.0 services, so I won’t dwell on it. If you’re one of the 37 or so people left on the planet not on Facebook, it is simply a platform to stay in touch with people: your friends, family, colleagues, bandmates, anyone. You connect as “friends” with people, which makes it possible to see things they post- messages on their wall, notes (sort of like blog posts), pictures, etc. Facebook is useful for collaboration largely because it’s very easy to find people and engage them.

Yes, Skype is a chat client, but its power is actually in its ability to host voice calls over the Internet (Voice over IP, or “VOIP”). So with a headset (or headphones and a mic), Skype lets you call any other Skype user, anywhere in the world, for any length of time, free of charge. Skype also offers Skype-to-phone service for a monthly fee, allowing you to use Skype as your main telephone (although there are disclaimers about reliability and “do not use for 911 services”). Skype also allows conference calls- also free of charge if everyone is on Skype. In fact, this is how the SCOREcast Round Table sessions are often accomplished- over Skype, with some sort of recording software (I prefer Freecorder [www.freecorder.com]) recording the conversation. In fact, with a little creativity, you can set up Skype to “send” your entire system’s sound to the other party. I’ve used a setup like this to work in real-time with the Director I work with on a documentary. He was in California, I’m in Texas- but it was as if he was sitting in the seat beside me. The only thing that would have made our Skype sessions even more productive would have been if he’d been able to see my screen as we worked together.

In my day job we use Microsoft Live Meeting, which is a huge, robust, enterprise-scale collaboration product, including desktop sharing. The concept behind all these is whatever you see on your screen, the party on the other side sees the same thing. These products would have been very useful near the end of my documentary project when we were fine-tuning placement of cues in the film, but there are a number of other uses for services such as these- just think about it. You could have a bassoon player in New York eyeball or play for you music straight from your Sibelius. Or you could let a sound design guru take over your desktop to make some trippy tweaks in your copy of Omnisphere, then you could test out the cue with the new settings, as he listens.

Well, I’d argue that before you can schedule and plan major scoring projects for real clients, you need how you’re going to do the job.  Before you commit yourself to a deadline with financial consequences, you’d better have in place a well-practiced, ready-to-go \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eworkflow \u003c/span\u003ecapable of progressing from concept to deliverable product.

But the needed workflow is based in part on having access to and mastery of an adequate set of \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003etools\u003c/span\u003e.  You can't very well figure out how you're going to work without knowing what your tools are going to be.  Which tools are most appropriate will depend on your training, artistic preferences and aims, and financial resources.  For many of us, in this digital age, those tools include a computer or computers, digital audio workstation (DAW) software, virtual instrument (VI) libraries, at least basic audio gear, and perhaps musical instruments (such as a MIDI keyboard) for getting our musical ideas into the computer and/or software programs that hopefully streamline various composing and production tasks.  Some individuals have the chops to get the job done \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ewithout \u003c/span\u003eall of these technological crutches, and I admire them greatly – but in this article, I’m addressing those who want or need to go the technology route.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAmong the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003etechnorati\u003c/span\u003e, many will explore and prototype their cues and songs using \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eMIDI\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003emockup\u003c/span\u003e, and some will even use MIDI as their means of final production.  With this aim comes a bewildering array of questions.  How much computer will I need?  What type of computer, how fast, how much RAM, how much disk, what operating system, what software, what libraries?  How many bits, what sample rate?  On and on.  So much to learn, so much to decide.  And I am down in the trenches grappling with these issues, every day.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs a writer for SCOREcast Online, it continues to be one of my objectives to make this process just a little less daunting by sharing a substantial amount of detail about what I’m finding as my particular musico-technical journey progresses.  Keep in mind that I’m among those deeply interested in MIDI and expect it to play a key role in my workflow.  At this stage of my development, I have a couple of key goals:  1) I want to learn about composing and orchestrating for traditional orchestra;  and  2) I want to be able to play back my \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003efull orchestra\u003c/span\u003e MIDI mockups, in \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ereal time\u003c/span\u003e, on a\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003e single computer\u003c/span\u003e, as I compose.

I’m also not trying to match the interpretation that any particular orchestra, conductor, or engineer may have made of Stravinsky’s work.  I don’t expect to fool an expert listener into thinking he or she is hearing a real orchestra, but I do want the result to be good enough that perhaps the vast majority of lay listeners would accept it as being worth listening to.  I also want it to succeed as a carrier of mood and emotion.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eam \u003c/span\u003eliterally taking Stravinsky’s score (actually, the Dover edition of the full score) and using my MIDI skills and technology assets to produce a MIDI sequence from it, with great care given to the many nuances written into the score and many other nuances that are the result of my own musical interpretation.  The intensive, extended practice steadily improves both my sequencing and my ear.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eExperts will probably find in my MIDI work plenty of things to complain about, with justification.  They will be expecting to hear what they’re accustomed to hearing, based on their knowledge and experience of real orchestras.  In some passages, the MIDI mockup will come very close to “real”, while in other cases I think it’s fair to say that the result will include some elements that sound unfamiliar or aberrant when judged from the perspective of real orchestra.  Yet even these problematic elements can function well and have appeal in their own right.  I think most listeners are far less critical than the experts and can find much to enjoy in this technologically-produced music.  Does it sound like what Stravinsky had in mind?  I don’t know.  Would he roll over in his grave?  Honestly, I doubt it … though he might raise his eyebrows a bit.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBy immersing myself in bringing the score to life, I’m discovering (or re-discovering) plenty about how one can create interesting and compositionally useful sounds using the instruments of traditional orchestra – or, more accurately, the instruments of my particular virtual orchestra.  The process also forces me to learn a great deal about reading scores.  In addition, I find that I encounter – and eventually overcome – one technological hurdle after another.  This is making me increasingly expert at applying all of my tools and, ultimately, is contributing much to the workflow I need to develop.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eSome Early Results\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTo give you an idea what this stuff sounds like, I’ve provided links to two examples.

Of course, you can figure these things out for yourself, but learning the hard way (by trial and error) can make an already expensive proposition even more expensive.  So, here we go.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eThe Computer.  \u003c/span\u003eAfter earlier disappointments with lesser computers – including one specifically designed for music-making – I concluded that half-measures just weren’t going to cut it, and that if I was going to be serious about working with full orchestra, I needed something more powerful.  With what I had, I could neither fit all the VIs of an orchestra at one time, nor run them fast enough to avoid the dreaded pops and clicks (or worse – crashes) that occurred when the CPU or disk couldn’t keep up with the demand for their services.  In addition, it became painfully clear that I was going to need more storage capacity for the better-quality libraries of sample-based VIs (sample disk), for project data including lots of large audio, video, MIDI, and other media (project disk), and for system and application files (system disk) – preferably all on separate drives for performance reasons.  And the motherboard(s) needed to be capable of the very high data throughput implied by fast computing, massive disk I/O, and audio streaming.  Those were just the primary concerns.  There were also many other practical issues related to being able to operate in a more reliable manner, such as being able to make backups of huge amounts of data.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt appeared there were basically two choices:  either a network of synchronized computers (say, a bunch of PCs, Macs, or Muse Receptors) running collaborating software applications, or a bigger, badder single computer.  From years of experience as an engineer, I judged that the multi-machine approach was almost guaranteed to bring its own crop of operational and reliability headaches.  Moreover, it wasn’t likely to be any cheaper than a single, large machine – and maybe more expensive.  Thus, I went with the single, big machine option.  I thought this would enable me to work more or less the same way I had before, when my objectives were much more modest than full orchestra – only now everything would scale up by a large factor.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBigger and badder -- but \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ehow\u003c/span\u003e?  Well, at the time I was considering all of this (about 18 months ago), I was expecting that most or all of my virtual orchestra would be sample-based VIs, like those I could get from \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eEastWest \u003c/span\u003eor \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eVienna\u003c/span\u003e.  I knew that in order to have samples ready to play at the moment they’re needed, sample players (such as EastWest’s \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ePlay \u003c/span\u003eengine or Native Instruments’ \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eKontakt\u003c/span\u003e) need to load some portion of the samples – those that represent the front ends of any notes that might be played – into RAM ahead of time.  While those samples are being played during real-time rendition of a musical composition, the sample player is reading the follow-on samples into RAM from disk.  In theory, if you had a sufficiently fast disk, you could get away without pre-loading any samples into RAM and read them all from disk when needed.  Then you might be able to get by with a relatively small amount of RAM.  But disk systems fast enough for this either don’t exist or would be prohibitively expensive; so, in general, a practical trade-off is made, involving both a lot of RAM, fast disk, and various system optimizations that avoid bottlenecks that could interfere with moving large blocks of data quickly from disk to RAM.  (The said optimizations are much of what you’re presumably paying for when you buy a computer that’s claimed to be specially tuned for digital audio application.)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut – since I didn’t know exactly \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ehow much \u003c/span\u003eof each computing resource was going to be needed, I could by no means be sure I’d need less than 4 Gbytes of RAM.  This amount of RAM is the great dividing line between 32-bit computers and 64-bit computers.  In other words, if your DAW application will use more than 4 Gbytes when all of the needed VIs are loaded, you’ll need a 64-bit computer, because a 32-bit computer can’t address more than 4 Gbytes of RAM (without using tricks that you’d really rather not rely upon).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo I took the plunge for a 64-bit computer, and decided to aim for 16 Gbytes of RAM.  How did I pick 16 Gbytes?  Well, there were three factors.  First, I had been reading that one needed at least 8 Gbytes of RAM to work with a full orchestra, so I took that as a lower limit, even though I couldn’t justify this figure at the time.  Second, the pricing of RAM was such that cost per Gbyte took a sharp upward turn above 16 Gbytes, while the cost to go from 8 Gbytes to 16 Gbytes was not prohibitive.  The third factor was my knowledge that, within limits, one could compensate for having less RAM by having a faster disk.  (Some sample players, such as Kontakt, have a software option that lets you adjust the amount of sample data the player will pre-load into RAM – which is the principal issue affecting total RAM usage.)  My strategy was to configure a very fast dedicated disk drive for my samples – this way, I figured that if a slower disk would force me above 16 Gbytes of RAM, maybe a much faster disk was insurance that 16 Gbytes would be adequate.  As I’ll discuss later, this seems to have proven correct, based on my \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eRite Of Spring\u003c/span\u003e experiences.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe fast sample disk was achieved by adding a RAID controller card to my computer and using four Western Digital \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eRaptor \u003c/span\u003e150-Gbyte drives, combined into a single RAID-0 array with a total formatted capacity of 558 Gbytes.  Even without creating the RAID array, these drives are very fast, turning at 10K RPM and having an access time about half that of more ordinary disks.  This solution was a bit pricey, but it gave me a lot of confidence that disk speed would not be the weak link in my system.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMy computer’s internal system drive, together with the four Raptors, made for a total of 5 internal drives.  I couldn’t put any more than this number inside the box, so I knew that any additional disk, such as for project data storage, additional sample library storage, and backup meant I’d need to use external disk drives.  My initial plan was to use \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eFirewire \u003c/span\u003edrives for all of these purposes, but for reasons that I never fully uncovered, this arrangement never worked reliably or at the performance level I needed for serious productivity.  After about six very painful months of struggling with these problems, I ended up using a bunch of external drives interfaced to the unused SATA ports of my motherboard and RAID controller card.  Two of these physical drives are combined into a single, 930-Gbyte logical drive configured as a RAID-0 array – this drive is used for additional, lower-priority sample libraries that don’t fit on the internal Raptor array.  A third, fixed 465-Gbyte drive stores project data.  A removable fourth drive, also with 465 Gbytes of formatted capacity, is loaded into a drive bay whenever I need to make backups of system or project data.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs I’ve said, the computer’s motherboard needs to be capable of meeting the data throughput demands imposed by having to move massive amounts of sample data from disk to RAM during playback, and, during recording of audio tracks, from RAM to disk as well.  For this purpose, I went with a Windows-compatible computer built around a server-class motherboard (\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eTyan\u003c/span\u003e 5396) that hosts two quad-core \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eIntel Xeon \u003c/span\u003eCPUs, for a total of 8 CPU cores.  These CPUs, the chipset that supports them, and the motherboard design work synergistically to achieve very fast data bus and cache operation, essential to avoid data bottlenecks.  By the way, taking advantage of the multi-CPU architecture requires DAW, VI, and driver software to be written explicitly with this in mind.  Fortunately this has, in fact, been occurring. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhy did I choose a Windows machine and not a Mac?  Well, for one thing, I had been using Windows for the previous 12 years, was comfortable with it, and was using other Windows machines with which I wanted to remain compatible.  I also felt that the Windows world offered more options, and I knew that much of the software I was interested in using was supported on both Mac and PC if I ever decided to move to a Mac.  Finally, at the time, I perceived that Microsoft’s operating systems had somewhat of an edge in supporting 64-bit computing with large amounts of RAM.  So far I haven’t regretted my decision.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe CPU cores operate at a clock speed of 2.67 GHz.  Why did I choose that speed, which is not the fastest available?   Again, a judgment call based on tradeoffs.  First, the cost of higher-speed CPUs increases more rapidly than the extra benefit they deliver – i.e., you get more bang for the buck at middle-level speeds.  Second, a faster CPU may require the other system components (e.g., RAM) to be faster as well – increasing the cost impact.  Third, higher clock rates can mean higher power dissipation, such that your computer runs hotter – and that reduces reliability.  So, I stuck my finger in the wind and chose the middle ground.  My choice has turned out to be adequate.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe motherboard also has quite a few slots for PCI expansion cards.  Experience has shown that having enough of these slots is crucial – I’m using all the slots I have, and would use more if I had them.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOne last detail:  I chose an \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eRME 9652 \u003c/span\u003ecard as my computer’s audio interface.  This choice was made because RME was early in providing a driver that supports 64-bit operation.  The 9652 also has three ADAT input and 3 ADAT output ports, collectively capable of moving up to 24 channels of audio at 48 KHz sample rate.  This is how I move digital audio streams between my computer and my outboard gear, including my A/D-D/A converter.  Most of the time, I use no more than 4 of the 24 audio channels for the type of work I’ve chosen to do – i.e., I’m not trying to create a full-blown recording studio, per se, but rather an environment for MIDI-enabled composing.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eThe Software. \u003c/span\u003e Once I determined that a 64-bit computer was the way I’d go, I was in dangerous territory, because to use such a machine in a way that takes full advantage of RAM above the 4- Gbyte boundary, you have to have software that runs in 64-bit mode.  This includes your operating system, your DAW software, your drivers (such as the driver for your digital audio card and any other piece of hardware integrated into your computer), and as many of your VIs as possible.  At the time I was figuring all of this out (18 months ago), there wasn’t much available that worked in 64-bit mode, and it was unclear how long it would be before the situation improved significantly.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe first decision to be made was which 64-bit operating system to use.  Should it be \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eWindows\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eXP\u003c/span\u003e, with which I was familiar, or \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eWindows Vista\u003c/span\u003e, which implemented more leading-edge technology but about which I’d heard lots of bad press and had even had my own negative experiences?  I was advised to go with \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eVista Ultimate 64-bit\u003c/span\u003e, as XP was seen as a dead-end product and software vendors were designing their products to work under Vista.  Once again, I decided to take a calculated risk – in this case, that things would work out best over time if I went with Vista.  I made this decision, as well as my choice of computer hardware configuration, in combination with the availability of a convincing level of technical support from the computer’s vendor, \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ePC Audio Labs\u003c/span\u003e.  I’ve paid extra for that support, but I figured my shot at business success was conditioned upon having a computer that worked well and had minimum downtime, and the extra cost seemed worth it.  Experience has proven me right.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI decided to use Steinberg’s \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eCubase \u003c/span\u003eas my DAW, for the following reasons:  1) I was familiar with Cubase, liked the way it worked, and didn’t want to be tied to dedicated hardware as would have been the case had I chosen a product such as \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eProTools\u003c/span\u003e;  2) I knew Cubase was a relatively mature product but that a 64-bit product was under development;  and 3) I felt that Steinberg’s pioneering role as developer of the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eVST \u003c/span\u003e(\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eV\u003c/span\u003eirtual \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eS\u003c/span\u003etudio \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eT\u003c/span\u003eechnology) plug-in standard meant that most VI vendors would be sure their plug-ins worked with Cubase.  At the time of my decision, Steinberg was offering only a “preview version” of their 64-bit software (which was later to be introduced on a fully-supported basis with the release of Cubase 5).  This preview version was said to be for those brave souls who needed to be at the bleeding edge of technology.  I figured that while Steinberg was readying a fully-supported 64-bit version, I’d be coming up the learning curve on a lot of other things.  This conjecture proved to be true, and the timing worked out about right.  I’m now running 64-bit Cubase 5.1.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs for virtual instruments from which I can build a complete orchestra, I’m currently using a combination of products from different vendors.  You hear this combination in the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eRite Of Spring\u003c/span\u003e examples.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs I described back in July, I’m using WIVIs for all of my woodwinds and brass.  Since July, I’ve only grown happier with the WIVI approach.  I expect my use of WIVIs will expand over the next year or two as new instruments are introduced and existing ones are improved.  One of the biggest positive impacts of the WIVIs is that they use very little RAM, because they’re based on modeling rather than sampling.  In principle, they also use little CPU.  However, current WIVIs operate only in 32-bit mode, whereas I have a 64-bit environment.  I’m able to use them through the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eVST Bridge\u003c/span\u003e feature of Cubase.  This works by creating a software wrapper around any 32-bit VST plug-in instance;  the wrapper makes the VST instance appear to Cubase as if it’s a 64-bit plug-in, and makes Cubase appear to the VST instance as if it’s a 32-bit DAW.  That’s great except that VST Bridge adds a surprisingly large amount to the total CPU workload, and the amount added is roughly proportional to the number of 32-bit plug-in instances.  If you have a large number of WIVIs, this can easily add up to the single largest component of CPU usage.  Although I find I can live with the actual amount of CPU load I have in the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eRite Of Spring\u003c/span\u003e, I’ve decided to reduce the load by taking advantage of the ability of a WIVI plug-in instance to incorporate more than one virtual instrument.  I’ve used this technique to reduce the number of WIVI plug-ins by a factor of about 5, relative to the number I’d have if I put only one instrument in each plug-in instance.  That has brought my \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eRite Of Spring\u003c/span\u003e CPU usage down to about 60% of what it previously was.  More about these numbers later.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFor strings, I’m using \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eAudiobro\u003c/span\u003e’s recently-introduced \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eLA Scoring Strings\u003c/span\u003e (LASS) library.  This is a sample-based library and, depending on how you use it, is quite capable of filling 16 Gbytes of RAM – which is what I have.  It’s a good thing my WIVIs don’t use much RAM!  My standard LASS setup deliberately creates a great deal of flexibility so that I usually have at my disposal what I need without having to pause in the middle of composing to add something that’s not there.  The downside of this strategy is that it requires a lot of RAM.  If I use LASS’s 24-bit samples, the amount of RAM used is uncomfortably close to 16 Gbytes.  Thus, for most of my work, I use the 16-bit samples, which cuts several Gbytes from my RAM usage (the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eRite Of Spring\u003c/span\u003e MP3s were made using LASS’s 16-bit samples).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLASS samples are hosted by \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eKontakt 3.5\u003c/span\u003e, which is a recently-introduced, 64-bit version of the Kontakt sampler.  I’ve been extremely pleased with how well Kontakt 3.5 has worked with the rest of my 64-bit environment – almost flawlessly.  I use the full version of the Kontakt 3.5 sampler, but you can also use the Kontakt 3.5 player that’s supplied by Audiobro, along with LASS.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLASS, by the way, is a fantastic string library and one of the best acquisitions I’ve made.  Besides the quality of the sound, I especially like the way LASS lets me handle divisi string parts by combining ensembles of different sizes.  Still, I’ve only scratched the surface of what LASS can do.  But as LASS’s many positive attributes are not the main focus of this article, I’ll leave further discussion of those to another day.  There are a few shortcomings.  For example, the initial LASS version includes no col legno samples, which are required by \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eThe Rite Of Spring\u003c/span\u003e.  For those, I used samples from the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSonic Implants String Collection\u003c/span\u003e, with good result.  In another case, the tail end of one of the Rite Of Spring examples required samples of cello played \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003emarcatissimo\u003c/span\u003e, which LASS didn’t have (there was also a problem of range).  I solved that problem satisfactorily with samples from EWQLSO.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo far, I’ve needed only four percussion instruments in \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eThe Rite Of Spring\u003c/span\u003e.  I addressed all of those needs with samples from EWQLSO, delivered by EastWest’s 64-bit Play engine.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn addition to all of the instruments I’ve described, there are currently 15 reverb instances, one of which is a convolution reverb, and a few equalizers.  There’s plenty of CPU headroom available for doing more of this type of processing if and when it becomes my focus – say, to improve the mix.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eBottom Lines\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn my \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eRite Of Spring\u003c/span\u003e project, I currently have a total of 281 virtual instruments loaded.  The lion’s share of these (217) are string instruments from the LASS library.  This seemingly large imbalance can be explained by the fact that the LASS instruments are sample-based and have separate samples (which I’m counting as separate instruments) for the various articulations that are supported.  On the wind side, in contrast, all of the instruments are WIVIs, which, by nature, don’t have multiple articulations.  Instead, you get different sounds by varying the many model parameters but chiefly by the way you apply the MIDI breath control (CC2).  In any case, it’s never the case that all 281 instruments are playing at the same time.  The total is probably closer to something in the range from 50 to 75 instruments playing simultaneously.  The number of simultaneous \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003evoices \u003c/span\u003eplaying, however, can be several times this figure.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThese 281 instruments are using about 12.5 Gbytes of RAM.  Given the 3.5 Gbytes left over, I’m happy to report that with everything loaded, the system shows no sluggishness of interactive response;  thus, it’s very easy to work on \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eThe Rite Of Spring\u003c/span\u003e in Cubase.  So far, it hasn’t been necessary to conserve RAM by resorting to any \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003etrack freezing\u003c/span\u003e or, in the case of samples hosted by Kontakt 3 (such as the LASS samples), \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esample purging\u003c/span\u003e.  These factors are important, because they translate directly into increased productivity. The main adverse consequence of having so much sample data in RAM is that it takes a long time to load and unload projects.  Loading typically takes about 8 to 10 minutes, and unloading between 1 and 2 minutes.  These long times create a disincentive to switching projects – I’ve compensated for this by attempting to have everything I need in the loaded project.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCubase includes a disk activity monitor that seems to suggest that even when the full orchestra is playing the most intensive passages I’ve so far encountered in \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eThe Rite Of Spring\u003c/span\u003e, the main sample drive – the one built using the four Raptors in a RAID-0 array –  isn’t breaking a sweat.  It doesn’t even register on the meter, except at the start of playing.  I’ve never heard a pop that’s characteristic of a disk (or CPU or motherboard) that can’t keep up.  This suggests that I might be able to reduce the amount of RAM I’m using by reducing the value of the RAM pre-load size parameter in Kontakt 3.5.  This would demand more from the disk, but the disk seems to have a lot more to give.  We’ll see.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCPU load and its distribution across the 8 CPU cores can be effectively monitored using the Performance tab of the Task Manager built into Windows Vista.  This monitor shows that during playback of The Rite Of Spring, CPU usage is distributed fairly uniformly among the 8 cores, peaks in the 30% to 35% range in the most intensive passages, and runs from 20% to 25% in less-demanding passages.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAll of these observations add up to the overall conclusion that the system is easily meeting its performance objectives with comfortable margin when handling full-orchestra, real-time playback of complex orchestration.  Given all the blood, sweat, and tears that have gone into getting this far, that’s welcome news indeed.  And if you’ve ever wondered whether these big systems really work – you have your answer.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCould I have gotten by with less?  Perhaps.  But I think that, one way or another, lesser solutions would have exacted painful costs in terms of productivity and/or compromises in the types of material I could attempt to compose.  My goal has been to minimize those costs whenever possible, and it looks like I’ve succeeded.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eDespite all the things I’ve said in this rather long-winded article, there are many topics I’ve omitted.  So if I’ve raised any burning questions in your mind, either technical or artistic, please make a comment and I’ll try to fill the gaps.  Meanwhile, I hope I’ve provided you with one possible roadmap to a system that just might be able to support your dream workflow.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cdiv class\u003d\"zemanta-pixie\" style\u003d\"height: 15px; margin-top: 10px;\"\u003e\u003ca class\u003d\"zemanta-pixie-a\" href\u003d\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/9d1081f1-f241-4dd7-a491-942f0df7c28f/\" title\u003d\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\"\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" class\u003d\"zemanta-pixie-img\" src\u003d\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id\u003d9d1081f1-f241-4dd7-a491-942f0df7c28f\" style\u003d\"border: medium none; float: right;\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"zem-script more-related pretty-attribution\"\u003e\u003cscript defer\u003d\"defer\" src\u003d\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type\u003d\"text/javascript\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class\u003d\"blogger-post-footer\"\u003e\u003cimg width\u003d'1' height\u003d'1' src\u003d'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2957472132698657339-992258179077564482?l\u003dwww.scorecastonline.com' alt\u003d'' /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"},"link":[{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2957472132698657339/posts/default/992258179077564482"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2957472132698657339/posts/default/992258179077564482"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"../../../../../2009/09/how-big-how-fast-and-just-plain-how.html","title":"How Big, How Fast, and Just Plain How"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Jim Well"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"}}],"media$thumbnail":{"xmlns$media":"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/","url":"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_vV7U0jxn89Q/SqdvuGXvMaI/AAAAAAAAAC4/GNusqY4bHVg/s72-c/well-insideoutside.png","height":"72","width":"72"}}]}});
