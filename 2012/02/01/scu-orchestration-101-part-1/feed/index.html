					<description><![CDATA[Dear Ruth,
According to your comment on Stellita&#039;s work, I am very much intrigued to hear your musical creations and capabilities of music production, probably you have a vast knowledge on this subject. So please enlighten all of us with a couple of links to your musical creations.
Thank you in advance]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Ruth, 
Thank you for taking the time to read my articles and listen to my work. 
Allow me to clarify something here in case it is the cause of your frustration. By writing these articles I am not claiming that I am teaching anyone or anything. I am simply presenting information in a way that will allow fellow composers to have quick access to important concepts. Make no mistake, it is as much a learning process for me as for anyone else reading these articles. I still have a long way to go until I can claim that I KNOW but that does not mean that I cannot try to help others find information more clearly organized. I am a geek at heart and every step of the way I am trying to find ways to organize information so that I will learn and remember more easily. That is exactly what I am presenting here.
Again, thank you for your time and comments. I wish you all the very best in finding those teachers that will inspire you to learn from them. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Someone once told me, many years ago, only to listen to those that can do what they teach. I read your articles and found them interesting enough to be curious as to your own work. Your musical creations are actually very poor. Like a capable hobbyist. But nothing more. I listened to your soundcloud offerings and was very disappointed at what you have done. Amateurish to say the least. It concerns me that you write such lengthy and seemingly knowledgable articles when it is obvious that you really should not be. Not,at least, until you reach a much higher standard. No point in trying to teach when you can not &#039;do&#039;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks!  Looking forward to more.

&quot;One of the most important ‘rules’ of orchestration is variety and 
surprise. Keep your listeners alert by giving them little surprises 
every few bars. A good rule of thumb is to change the orchestration or 
small bits of it every few phrases or at every new section.&quot;

Great advice --  too bad it doesn&#039;t work for every cue or every director.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@031de5627e2e0960b8a55c1b67b552e9:disqus I think that assigning parts to instruments or instrument families definitely falls into orchestration - even with jazz.  To me, arranging has more to do with the song structure - e.g. whether or not you have an intro and how the piece is laid out - AABABCB - stuff like that.  Whether the sax or trumpet has the melody on section B2 would fall into orchestration.

Just my $.02,
Marc]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent! Looking forward to this. One question: I always thought of Arranging as arranging any song--yours or someone else&#039;s. Orchestration is a more specific form of arranging for orchestra only. For example, if I&#039;ve written a jazz piece and I&#039;m writing an arrangement for live musicians to play, you wouldn&#039;t call that orchestration, would you? So I think &quot;arranging&quot; has a broader definition than what you described above.]]></description>
