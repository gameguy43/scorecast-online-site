The articles this month have been particularly vibrant and thought-provoking. One subject that deserves additional mention is the idea of \"the day gig\". It's fairly easy to understand why it doesn't get top billing. It's not the most glamorous subject compared to our core interest, and quite frankly most composers rightfully shy away from telling anyone about a day job for fear that it might be interpreted as \"not being serious\" about film composing. It's a traditional dirty little secret, but it bears some scrutiny because it can be such an important part of sustaining the effort to \"make it\" as a full-time film composer.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca name\u003d'more'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-size:100%;\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-family:arial;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-family:arial;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd even though I’ve been in Los Angeles for several years and have worked on my share of projects, I still need the steady income of a regular job to make ends meet. I’m also not afraid to say that I've made many mistakes on that front along the way. The main misstep was thinking that if I had just \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eany \u003c/span\u003ejob that paid \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ethis \u003c/span\u003eor \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ethat \u003c/span\u003eamount of money then I'd be able to leverage the after-hours time (and money) to make the rest \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ehappen \u003c/span\u003eby force of will. And if you read SCO articles on a regular basis you'd gather that this is at best only partly true. In fact there's enough wrong with that line of thinking that it can simply be discarded. This is a lesson that I've learned the hard way. \u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-family:arial;\"\u003eAnd therein lies the rub - there is \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eno easy way\u003c/span\u003e in this business – the concept of \"a well-worn path to success\" simply doesn't exist in nature. That's because (among a million other variables) everyone comes to the marketplace with different background and experience - as well as unique talent, aspirations and ambitions. That also means that there's no sure-fire skill set, tool set or any other kind of \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eset\u003c/span\u003e that automatically translates to success. This somewhat echoes Randy Knaub's great article from earlier this month – but it bears repeating – it’s a mental trap to think \"if I only had *this* [insert name of gear/software/contact/meeting/audition/job here]\". I’ve been guilty of that on all fronts, not the least of which is the job front – and since I just landed a really great day gig I thought I’d take a moment to share some perspective.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-family:arial;\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTime \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eis \u003c/span\u003emoney – but the inverse is \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003enot \u003c/span\u003etrue\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-family:arial;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMoney can’t buy you love, and it can’t buy you \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003etime \u003c/span\u003eeither. The biggest mistake I’ve made in previous day jobs was to underestimate the time outside of “core business hours” that a job can demand. This varies from the simple logistics of an extended commute to the more complicated situation of a corporate culture that expects salaried employees to give up their personal lives for the company. This seems kind of obvious as I’m writing it, but it can be a slippery slope for a well-paying job turn into life-swallowing drudgery. In at least one case, an employer (part of a major film studio) actually hid that little nugget from prospective employees until they were hired on – and then were pulled aside for “the talk” from one of the supervisors shortly after joining. Not cool.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-family:arial;\"\u003eIn another case, there were “social” and “volunteer” events that an employer expected everyone to participate in.  And while it can be fun to socialize and goof off with co-workers to build professional bonds and friendships – it’s another thing to get the stink eye from the boss on Monday morning because you didn’t participate in a paintball competition with co-workers over the weekend. My point is that you have to guard your studio time like it’s pure gold, because, well – it \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"\u003eis \u003c/span\u003epure gold. Whether you’re writing music for your big break or simply sharpening the saw, it is time you’ll never get back. And like directors and film producers, many employers will try to get as much of that as they can whether or not they pay for it.

It doesn’t matter if it’s the influence from a family member, significant other, or friend – or even arm’s-length interaction with a boss or co-worker – we are influenced by people we meet every day. As composers we’re prone to think of ourselves as particularly strong-willed and resistant to unwanted influence. But at the end of the day we’re all human beings. Given that a day job can force us to spend a significant portion (and sometimes a majority) of our waking hours with a relatively arbitrary social group, it can take some time to understand how that steers us personally. And generally speaking just because a relationship is toxic doesn’t mean it started out on a bad note. It’s like the cliché of being in a popular rock band where it’s all fun and games until it all goes sideways as the drummer goes into rehab the same weekend that the lead guitarist finds his girlfriend in the bass player’s bed. While not as dramatic, a toxic vibe at the day gig can sometimes mean too many after-hours happy hours that lead to poor performance at work and in the studio. It can also stem from a negative or frustrating work environment that you “take home” to stew on and mentally starve yourself of precious time to prep your demo reel or set up that next industry meeting. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-family:arial;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd while it’s too much to ask for a gig that requires \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eno \u003c/span\u003eeffort, the next best thing is to have a job that keeps you busy and engaged. Time flies when you’re having fun, and in this case, time flies when you’re working hard. It’s even better when the day gig taxes the part of the brain that’s unrelated to producing music. At one time I thought that I’d enjoy a day job that was closer to the film or audio business, and I was dead wrong. Even though my current day job is with a firm that does music production, I’m not in a studio during the day. So when I get home my place seems “fresh”, which is partly psychological but it helps to feel like “revving up” for a session. And aside from the self-hypnosis there is the actual physical advantage of not having burned ears from dealing with fixing other people’s projects all day.  I’m still adjusting to my new routine, but I like it. Sometimes it means clearing my head by going to the gym after work, which seems counter-intuitive to exert yourself even further – but it works for me. \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eBe your own expert on this.\u003c/span\u003e Like many of the most important activities in life, if it doesn’t feel good you’re probably doing it wrong. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-family:arial;\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe first (and last) three rules\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-family:arial;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLocation. Location. Location. It cannot be said, typed or otherwise communicated enough. Fortune smiles on the prepared, but it gives a big sloppy wet kiss to the composer in the room that can deliver.

Again, this is a lesson that I have learned in stages, and to varying degrees of effectiveness. When I first moved to Los Angeles, I lived in Westwood but commuted to Culver City for work. The lesson I learned is that it doesn’t do you any good to be near industry events if you’re returning home too late (or too tired) to participate. When I found another job on the edge of Los Angeles County I thought it would be easy to maintain active contacts and continue working on projects. Again, I was wrong – dead wrong (a recurring theme for this article). When I relocated to Studio City, things changed noticeably for the better – and now that I’m working a day gig in Hollywood “proper”, I literally see what I’ve been missing. The difference between being in Hollywood and being in the Valley is, in a word, dramatic. It’s just a few miles’ difference, but the change is unmistakable. I’ll explain by example: \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-family:arial;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI met with a producer (who has become a good friend) in a Hollywood restaurant after work one day last week. It was the first time in several weeks that we’ve been able to find a time and place to get together and catch up. She told me of an LOI (letter of intent) just signed with a film company and was setting up to do a short film as a proof-of-concept for the larger project she’s developing. She also dropped a few names of the actors that were going to be in it, which was all exciting to hear. One of the phrases that popped out was “and you’ll be doing the music for it” which caused me to do a double-take. She \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003edidn\u003c/span\u003e’t say that they’d be holding auditions – she didn’t ask me to submit a demo – she said I was\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003e the one\u003c/span\u003e. This is called “the catbird seat”, which for me is a bit of an odd place to be. And of course – I tried to talk her out of it. I know. I feel like a moron as I type this, but it’s true. But hear me out... when actors of a certain caliber are bandied about, the assumption is that the principals are going to find an equally “sized” composer name (or one of their proxies/ghosts) to do the music. It has happened to me more than once, and I thought that this would be no exception. But when it comes down to moments like these - \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"\u003egeneralizations don't matter.\u003c/span\u003e This is *her* project, and well, it was *her* decision. So as a good friend she did the rational thing and started yelling at me, which caught a bit more attention than when she was dropping names. She was incredulous, and had every right to be. After I backtracked and we laughed it off, a person sitting at an adjoining table leaned in and said they’d never seen a composer try to “un-audition” for a gig. I responded with “it’s a gift” as I handed over one of my business cards. That night I got an email that he wanted to license a track from my online demo reel. I didn’t recognize the person’s name but I did recognize the company he works for. And, no – I didn’t try to talk him out of it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-family:arial;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis anecdote directly relates to my day gig in this way: the meeting took place in a restaurant that’s in the bottom floor of the building I now work in. It’s wonderful to have an office on the 18th floor with a clear view of the Hollywood sign and the Griffith Observatory, but the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"\u003ereal \u003c/span\u003evalue of that location is what happens on the street level. Maybe it has more to do with the “permissive” environment, for the lack of a better word. In that part of Hollywood it’s not uncommon to strike up a random conversation with someone while in line for the morning shot of java, only to turn around and recognize that person behind you as a character you see on television every week. (I thought his voice sounded familiar…) Never underestimate the power of being in the right place – because if you can stick around long enough the right time will come along. That’s why aspiring actors prefer to wait tables or sling lattes in Hollywood rather than make several times the salary in an office “outside the beltway”. One step off the beaten path is as good as being a world away.

Part strategic network, part support group, our times together are always amazing and I've never not come away with either some juicy info on a cool new compositional technique or a great new way to implement some sort of hardware or software tool. Composers often get pegged for some of our antisocial behavior, but when these 20 or so composers get together, the discussion and conversation flow can be endless, and these social gatherings often drag into the wee hours of the next morning.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAt the latest of these dinners this last weekend, I became engaged in a conversation about this month's topic of \"Getting the Gig\". It seems several of my composer pals are also heavy-duty SCOREcast readers and have been chomping at the bit to take me to task on some of our opined viewpoints on the subject.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca name\u003d'more'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs I listened intently to their complaints about the 1) over-saturated composing market, and 2) the downward spiral of the quality of film music today, I realized something about our theme of the month; Something that, quite possibly, could be a flaw in how we presented it this month; Something I never thought about, oddly, until I was sitting there listening to my composer friends struggle through what should have been a simple conversation about a very simple subject.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI realized this:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe \"gigs\" don't exist.\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNow, stay with me here... because, as usual, I don't mean that in the way that everyone else likes to mean it lately. I'm still an optimist. I don't believe that others can control my destiny, and I do not, for a single minute, believe that the world or the universe dictates what you are capable of with your skill set, your intellect, and your willingness to dig in hard and achieve. I refuse the popular notion that our industry — our craft and profession — is going to hell-in-a-handbasket, the sky is falling, and the world as we know it is coming to an end. (And dammit if Hans Zimmer and his merry band of monkeys aren't to blame!)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo, with that... here is what I mean...\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs composers, we are always searching for our next film gig. I know in my own career I get nervous as hell when I'm wrapping up a show and I don't have the next one lined up and ready to jump right into. For me, there is no greater stress than wondering where the next thing is going to come from, and my preference is always to have \"one to show and one to go\", as they say.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut honestly, \"gigs\", as we've all come to know them, do not exist anymore.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNow, there are \"gigs\" as in webisodes, short films, student thesis projects, commercials, or industrials.... those types of gigs. Some of them are healthy to take on and some of them are almost a \"pay-to-play\" situation, in which you'll have to decide on your own if they are healthy for you or not. But, with the rise of technology in film scoring, yes... it \u003ci\u003eis\u003c/i\u003e easy for just about anybody to edit together a great score from loops, samples, and other digital assets that have helped to shape industry trends over the last ten years. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAny of us, if we are being honest at all, have to understand that \"looped music\" has become as much an aesthetic as custom score has always become over the last hundred years. Whether we like it or not, there is a certain group of filmmakers who are \"just fine\" with a score edited together from loops and samples, and they will take it for some or \u003ci\u003eno\u003c/i\u003e money (if we are being real) in trade for the promise of backend money (if we are feeling lucky). That last sentence contained a lot of \"ifs\", didn't it?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\"Gigs\" — if we still define them as \u003ci\u003e\"jobs where we get to compose music the old fashioned way, and then get to realize that music through the recording of live instrumentation\"\u003c/i\u003e — are a very rare gift only given when a certain type of filmmaker recognizes the value that such a process lends to the overall quality of their project.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTherefore, I want to inject a new phrase into the vernacular — something that is both true and accurate, and alive and well in our craft, yet, also overlooked and maybe undervalued.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe gigs don't exist.

We need to stop looking for gigs as \"potential jobs\", and start treating \u003ci\u003epeople\u003c/i\u003e as \"potential partners\".\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003ePeople\u003c/i\u003e, in ANY arena in life, are what matter. I've been lucky in my career to make lifelong friends out of most of my clients. In fact, I can think of only one person that I've worked for that I don't speak to regularly either through emails or by telephone — only one director that I don't see socially at least once a year.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThat is because \"gigs\", in the way that we all like to think of them, are essentially worthless. But relationships... Ahhhh! They are absolutely worth every minute you spend cultivating them.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAsk Williams where he thinks he would be without Spielberg. Ottman without Singer. Burwell without Coens. Zimmer without Bruckheimer.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eRelationships are key, and they should not be regarded as casual, disposable assets — especially in favor of singular \"gigs\". Gigs are static events: they happen, and then they are over. But people... people are perpetual \u003ci\u003eorganisms\u003c/i\u003e, and in our case, organisms of the creative kind. What do we know of creativity? We know, because of our own \u003ci\u003ecomposer\u003c/i\u003e relationship with it, that it never rests. It is a an evolving, continuously germinating, living, breathing animal that never rests and is never satisfied. People, then, are essentially a \"fountain of youth\" for creative flow and opportunity, whereas \"gigs\" are simply \u003ci\u003egotten\u003c/i\u003e... and subsequently, \u003ci\u003eforgotten\u003c/i\u003e.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBefore I start sounding too much like Jerry Maguire, let me present a qualifier for what I am suggesting: Should you adopt this philosophy that I am proposing, you have to do it with a genuine heart. You cannot \"love people\" because you \"love what they might give you\". Pardon the expression, but that is a bullshit way to be. That is \"false\" in every sense, cheap in every way, and deceit at it's ugliest manifestation. We've all experienced the feeling of only being valued because of what we can provide the other person. It is a gross feeling, and one that leaves you used and abused on a number of levels. No. It as to come from a genuine place.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHere's the thing: If you cannot it within yourself to value those you desire to work with as people and not as objects that can provide you with sustenance, you are in the wrong place and you will never be truly successful. Mark my words. You will never attain a place of respect and honor in this small community we all work in and you will never become the composer you want to be, at the level you want to be composing at. Karma, as it is said, is a beotch!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere will be those who read this and say that, \"I don't have to like everyone I work with.\" That's right, you don't. Even I don't like everyone I've ever worked with, either. But I still value them as people who knew \u003ci\u003ewhat\u003c/i\u003e they wanted, \u003ci\u003ewhen\u003c/i\u003e they wanted it, and trusted \u003ci\u003eME\u003c/i\u003e to deliver it to them. That is a big responsibility and one that can never be taken as lightly as just saying, \"Yeah... that was a pretty good \u003ci\u003egig\u003c/i\u003e.\"\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThink about the gigs you've enjoyed the most in your career. Were they fun because the music was easy but the people were jerks? Or were they fun because the people were a blast and the challenge was difficult? I'm betting on the latter.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eForget \"gigs\". Gigs are going to be great, and gigs are going to suck. Gigs will come, and gigs will go. Gigs will work out, and entire scores will be thrown out. Such is the terrain of the composing journey. It is what it is.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe thing you DO have control over is how you seek out and treat the people that you will work with. Sometimes... and I've said this before... but sometimes people will place more value on how good of a hang you are than they will how great your music is. In fact, that happens a lot in this game. Learn to understand and \"be\" with that, rather than \"being\" with the thought that you \"just need a good film to write for\".\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhat we all really need is strong cinematic partners that have the same goals and aspirations as we do. Believe me, they are out there. I have several. I love them all. I cherish them first as people, secondly as friends, thirdly as collaborators.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe gigs really don't exist.

In your excitement, you talk through the particulars and get all of the information that you can... except for the \u003ci\u003emoney\u003c/i\u003e part. The conversation continues until, finally, there is nothing left to talk about EXCEPT for the money part, and now you are in that awkward position of doing the \u003ci\u003easking\u003c/i\u003e... since nobody is freely \u003ci\u003eoffering\u003c/i\u003e.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca name\u003d'more'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWe've all heard the old saying in our profession, usually in the context of speaking to someone about a possible project: \"Fast, cheap, or good. Pick two!\"\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTo be honest, I'm not sure where this adage came from. The first time I remember hearing it was in high school when someone wanted to hire a friend of mine to paint their house. After they haggled back and forth for what seemed like 45 minutes, my buddy finally said, \"Listen man! You can't have everything when you don't have any money. Fast, cheap, or good... you can only have two!\"\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhen I was starting out on the road to composing for film, I quickly realized the value of that statement. It seemed every time I turned around, my employers wanted all THREE. Their schedule was short, their money was tight, and their expectations were high. As it turns out, \"Fast, Cheap, AND Good\" is an impossible impossible standard to meet. So, picking two is very important. Over the years, the philosophy behind this ideal has served me well. I've used it too many times to count in order to help preserve my margins and stay competitive as a composer. It has taken some time, but I've had to really train myself to not be afraid of the money conversation with a producer, although I try to leave such dealings to my manager as often as I can.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHowever, there is a time and a place for everything, and what I'm about to say might be viewed as controversial, but I believe it needs to be discussed: \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003ci\u003eNot every composer is worth paying.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhat I mean by this is that a lot of people I know who are just getting started get going with the wrong idea... That simply because they have chosen composing for film and TV as a career choice, a producer should be paying them a certain rate based on the baseline value of a minute of music. Not true at all.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI'll illustrate what I mean with a personal story. \u003cbr /\u003eI know a fellow who is an incredible musician and wants to be a film composer. He is a gifted pianist and has more degrees on his wall than I would know what to do with. A while back, a gig that I was working on required me bringing in some help to finish up some source material at the last minute. I called this guy to see if he would be interested in jumping onboard. The production, although not gigantic, was sizable enough that I had about $2,500 left over to spend on source music. All I needed was three minutes of techno music to use for scenes set at a rave, and licensing a few tracks wouldn't do the job — the music had to written for the scene. My friend, who was really hustling to find some projects to get him started, was the perfect candidate for this and it would, I thought to myself, afford him a few immediate perks — a strong film credit, some quick cash, and a stepping stone into some larger projects. For someone who'd never done anything, it was the perfect opportunity. Honestly, it would have been a walk in the park for anybody.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs I approached him with the plan and laid out what I needed for the gig, I told him what the budget was. His response? \"I don't get out of bed for less than $5,000.\"\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAfter I wiped the shock off my face, I responded. \"With all due respect, pal, you have never scored a single frame. What do you mean you \"don't get out of bed for less than $5,000\"? Nobody's ever asked you to GET OUT OF BED, PERIOD!\"\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI cannot tell you how many times I've seen a composer price themselves out of the game. You see, it's not that this guy wasn't able to give me music that sounded like $5,000 music. He was. His talent wasn't the issue. His worth was the issue. The fact of the matter is that he wasn't worth $5,000. His resume wasn't a 5k resume. Hell... it wasn't even a 2.5k resume — he'd never done anything! He had nothing under his belt, no prior portfolio of work by which to show me he had worth as a composer, and therefore no guarantee, based on track record, that he could do the job that someone who was truly worth $5,000 could.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn short, his \u003ci\u003eworth\u003c/i\u003e didn't line up with his \u003ci\u003ewishes\u003c/i\u003e.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt is a hard truth, but you have to be a realist about \u003ci\u003e\u003cu\u003ewhere you are at\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/i\u003e in your career vs. \u003ci\u003e\u003cu\u003ewhere you want to be\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/i\u003e with it. They aren't the same, and your perceived value as a marketable composer in the community will reflect the former, not the latter. Getting the gig is all about timing, reputation, and perceived value. It really has little to do with talent. You might not even be a great composer, but for whatever reason you have done some projects and have proven that you can get the job done. Therefore, your perceived value is higher than the guy who hasn't.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eYou have to work your way up. I face it constantly at the level that I am at. I'm light years from where I was when I first started in the gig, but I'm also light years from where I want to be. While I'll never be comfortable or content with where I am in my career, I am aware of what level I am perceived at by most producers and am working to get myself to the next terrace. Based on that rational, I don't expect to be handed \u003ci\u003eStar Wars: Episode 7\u003c/i\u003e tomorrow, but I'll treat my current gig as equal to that opportunity and knock the ever-loving hell out of it!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo... Fast, Cheap, or Good? They say to pick \"two\". But I say... pick \u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eGOOD\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e. You really might be as great as you think you are, yet you are underpaid. It's a common tale. But your perceived value as a composer is what is keeping you from the next level, NOT the economy of film music. No excuses.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eToo many composers use the economy of film music as a reason to write poorly. In fact, I personally believe that some of the confusion surrounding this proposed composers' union in LA is born of that same attitude. Far too many composers don't understand where they stand in the food chain (or don't want to understand), and they think that having a union is going to help them magically transcend their perceived value. It won't. Please hear me... I'm NOT saying that the union is a bad idea. Not at all, in fact. What I'm saying is that the \u003ci\u003eidea\u003c/i\u003e that a union will help you get more gigs as a mediocre composer is just plain silly. You'll simply be a composer who's not very good in a union with composers that are. At that point, it just sucks to be \u003ci\u003eyou\u003c/i\u003e. So sorry.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhat's the bottom line? Make everything you do the best you've done. That is the way to the top. There are no shortcuts, there are no magic spells, there are no perfect answers. The only thing you have on your side is your word, your talent, and your perceived value in the marketplace. You have absolute power over all three of those things, but the third one will take the most work. Yes, your perceived value can be bolstered by you holding hard and fast to the baseline value of your music, but don't overestimate or naively inflate that number. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf your perceived value is \"0\" (you've never worked a paying gig), then you should be taking every gig and working every angle. That is the minimum requirement, anymore, to getting started it in this gig. You do not have the time or luxury for delusions of grandeur. Your ass can't be choosy. You need to work and you need to work \u003ci\u003enow\u003c/i\u003e.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eKnow where you are. Accept it, come to terms with it, do your best, and push hard for the next terrace. You never know.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOh, and by the way... Whatever happened with my little $2,500 source music debacle? I used a friend of a friend for the gig who was excited to just be working on something that was going to be seen. We worked great together. So great in fact... that he now composes with me on a show for primetime television.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHe just bought a house in Hancock Park.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eYou never know.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e_____________\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-size: small;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eSCOREcast founder \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eDEANE OGDEN\u003c/span\u003e is an award-winning composer who has written the music to over twenty feature films including THE SENSEI, DREAMS ON SPEC, IN THE EYES OF A KILLER, and THE WAY HOME.
