On the surface, the look and feel of a \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esmart sheet\u003c/span\u003e is similar to that of a conventional spreadsheet document – with rows and columns of \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ecells\u003c/span\u003e, and user interface functionality that makes it easy for you to enter, view, and manipulate your data in whatever way your particular collaboration methodology might require.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs a composer using \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSmartSheet\u003c/span\u003e, you might think of designing a set of \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esmart sheets\u003c/span\u003e that work like the documents you (and everyone else in the film music business) are already familiar with, such as spotting notes, timing breakdown, orchestral breakdown, recording session plan, track log, and so on.

Why not use these capabilities to organizing a re-usable infrastructure that supports collaboration between the many people who collaborate on a film music project, including the composer, music editor, film director, assistants, orchestrators, orchestra contractors, recording engineers, conductors, musicians, accountants, and so on?

Inside, you’re instantly presented with the sheets to which you have access rights, and you start working.  It’s pretty intuitive.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLet’s think about the implications of being “in the cloud”.  In the past, if you wanted to use personal computers to construct a distributed collaboratorium involving several individuals, you had to make sure they all had the same software on their computers.  If the collaborators were independent contractors, each would have had to purchase and install his or her own copy of any software needed.  You would have had to ensure that each collaborator owned a sufficiently compatible computer with adequate horsepower.  And then there could be a steep learning curve.  All of these factors would have been expense issues and coordination nightmares – which would have served as a barriers to ever getting the team together and off the ground.  The idea of instant, effortless, low-cost, Internet-enabled collaboration would have been little more than a wistful dream.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut with cloud-based collaboration using \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSmartSheet\u003c/span\u003e, most of these barriers evaporate.  All each collaborator needs is a low-cost laptop or netbook computer capable of running a modern web browser (and it doesn’t have to be the same browser on each individual’s computer).  Mobile device fans can even connect via their smartphones when on the move.  It’s literally true that if you’ve thought through your collaboration and project tracking methodology and have instrumented it in terms of a set of \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esmart sheet\u003c/span\u003e templates, you can choose team members, invite them into your collaboratorium (by means I’ll explain below), and tie them together within a matter of hours or maybe even minutes, with very little learning curve and \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ezero \u003c/span\u003eincremental buy-in cost on the part of invitees.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNotice that these benefits are \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ein addition to\u003c/span\u003e the most basic advantage of \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eany \u003c/span\u003escheme for collaborating over the web:  namely, that the members of your team can be distributed geographically – even across the globe – or, can be in the same room.  This means new flexibility in how you think about team formation and professional relationships.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eThe Benefit Of Sourcing Documents From The Cloud\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLet’s return for a moment to the fact that sharing project documents over the web is central to the way collaboration and project tracking are instrumented when using \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSmartSheet\u003c/span\u003e.  But how does storing these documents in the cloud and sourcing them to team members from the cloud improve sharing?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSharing documents might not seem like such a big deal at first, especially for computer-based documents.  You think,\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003e of course I’m going to share my documents with my team members, just like I always have\u003c/span\u003e.  And then you think:  \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eany time I revise a document, I’ll just send a copy of the updated document file to each team member, right?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere’s a potential problem with this thinking.  If a separate copy of a document resides on each team member’s computer, and the document is subject to change (especially if it can be changed frequently or by more than one person), the possibility arises that different team members can find themselves inadvertently working with \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003edifferent versions\u003c/span\u003e of the document.  In other words, team members can get out of sync with one another.  What could make this happen?  \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eScore changes, \u003c/span\u003eof course!  In today’s film music world, late changes – even up to the last minute – are an increasing risk.  Why?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWell, in the pre-digital age, a much less automated post-production technology meant that late-stage changes to picture or dialog caused unacceptable disruption that could delay final release, with adverse financial impact.  To avoid such disruptions, it used to be that \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003epicture lock\u003c/span\u003e was put into effect far earlier than it is now, relative to the targeted release date.  The lengthy time allowed for post-production let the start of film music work be postponed until picture lock, and thus composers could usually rely on working against stable picture.  But today, computers and digital technologies have drastically accelerated post-production, such that directors can (and often do) keep tweaking their films until much closer to the scheduled release date than before.  In contrast, the process of composing and producing film music \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ehasn’t \u003c/span\u003eaccelerated to the same degree.  The result is that music development is increasingly exposed to late dramatic and timing changes that require cues to be re-worked.  Cue revisions mean that documents supporting the music development process are being changed.  And, as I’ve pointed out, one of the ways a rush of changes can lead to chaos sand lost time is by causing inconsistencies to emerge between the versions of documents that different team members have.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut with \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSmartSheet \u003c/span\u003eand similar cloud-based document-sharing technologies, the idea is that team members \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003edon’t\u003c/span\u003e send copies of documents, revised or otherwise, to one another.  Instead, a \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esingle copy\u003c/span\u003e of each document (a \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esmart sheet\u003c/span\u003e) is stored in the cloud.  All team members work with that single copy – which reflects the latest revision status – within the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSmartSheet \u003c/span\u003eon-line environment.  In this way, the emergence of conflicting document versions is avoided – and with it, the associated chaos.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eEven better – although \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSmartSheet \u003c/span\u003ealways shows you (or any team member) the latest version of a document, it also shows you at a glance \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ewhat’s recently changed\u003c/span\u003e – information that could easily be overlooked with conventional documents.  In addition, SmartSheet transparently maintains a history of \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eall \u003c/span\u003echanges that have been made, as well as when and by whom they were made.  You can access this history for any given \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esmart sheet \u003c/span\u003ecell with a click of the mouse.

However, many or most film music enterprises are probably small enough that there need be only one sheet creator.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo, it all starts with an entrepreneurially-motivated individual – most likely the composer, who is typically at the head of his or her film music enterprise.  That person opens one of several types of paid accounts with \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esmartsheet.com\u003c/span\u003e.  There is a monthly (or annual) fee (as little as $8.50 a month for the most basic account), which entitles the payer to be a sheet creator and provides an \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eallotment of sheets\u003c/span\u003e.

The majority of competing orchestral virtual instrument products are based on direct instrument waveform sampling technology and often involve huge and relatively inflexible sample libraries.\u0026nbsp; In place of fixed samples, WIVIs utilize a highly-parameterized instrument waveform model based on a technique similar to additive synthesis.\u0026nbsp; Most of these parameters can be varied continuously via MIDI, allowing nuances of playing technique far beyond what is typically possible with samples.\u0026nbsp; In addition, WIVIs utilize various types of randomization that not only can mimic variations characteristic of real playing but also counteract \"phasing\" effects that otherwise occur when virtual instruments are combined into ensembles.\u0026nbsp; WIVI plugins (VST, RTAS, and AU) take very little RAM or disk space and, for this reason, help complex projects to load extremely quickly in a DAW.\u0026nbsp; They run happily in either 32- or 64-bit environments under either Windows or Mac operating systems.\u0026nbsp; WIVIs are set up using a unique and powerful visual user interface that excels in both parametric flexibility and the ability to configure ensembles.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCurrent WIVIs include many types of flutes, oboes, bassoons, clarinets, saxophones, and brass instruments (muted as well as unmuted) and are sold in bundles, working out to an average cost of about $25 per instrument.\u0026nbsp; A comprehensive set of WIVIs costs about $1500-$1600, street price.\u0026nbsp; Additional WIVIs are believed to be in development.\u0026nbsp; Strings, however, are notably missing from Wallander's offering and may or may not appear in the future.\u0026nbsp; Since I wrote about WIVIs in my July 15, 2009 SCOREcast column article, Wallander Instruments has released version 2.30, which makes many improvements to not only the WIVI interactive player but also to the sound and playability of all of the WIVI instruments.\u0026nbsp; Overall, I'm very enthusiastic about the expressiveness, creative possibilities, and sound quality WIVIs deliver and the degree to which they free me from many of the serious limitations of sample-based technology.\u0026nbsp;

LASS is at once notable for its beautiful, expressive sound and for what it does to simplify creation of convincing MIDI mockups of divisi string passages.\u0026nbsp; LASS approaches divisi by offering, in effect, 5 separately-recorded sample libraries rolled into one:\u0026nbsp; first chair (solo), two different 1/4 divisi sections, a 1/2 divisi section, and a full section -- for each of Violin 1, Violin 2, Viola, Cello, and Bass.\u0026nbsp; Samples from the different section types can be combined in any way desired, either to implement divisi or to create a full orchestra with maximum sonic diversity that maximizes the impression of realism.\u0026nbsp; LASS is also equipped with scripts (which run in the included Kontakt 3.5 playback engine environment) that make it relatively easy to orchestrate with samples of real legato, portamento, and glissando playing under MIDI control.\u0026nbsp; Additional scripts support trills, patterns of short articulations, tuning, and other features.\u0026nbsp; However, while LASS supports the string articulations one is most likely to need, some articulations, such as col legno, are not provided and may require you to combine LASS with another string library.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNot surprisingly, considering it is a sample library, LASS uses a lot of RAM.\u0026nbsp; To take full advantage of its features, one is likely to need a 64-bit computer with the ability to address between 8 and 16 Gbytes of RAM, and even then you have to put up with long project load times.\u0026nbsp; Audiobro advises that you may also need to utilize two multi-core computers if handling complex orchestrations, though I been successful running LASS on a single 8-core Windows PC.\u0026nbsp; If you have this level of compute power, you'll be amazed at what you can do.\u0026nbsp; If you don't, there are various ways of working with lesser resources, but with increasing degrees of compromise and/or inconvenience.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e_____________\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-size: x-small;\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eJIM WELL\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/span\u003eis the author of SCOREcast's \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eInside the Outside\u003c/span\u003e column.

But are \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ecreativity \u003c/span\u003eand \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ecreative process\u003c/span\u003e one and the same?  Perhaps, by thinking carefully about this question, you’ll better equip yourself to diagnose and remedy the coughs and sputters of your own creative engine.  Let’s find out.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs a commercially-oriented composer for media, I’d think of my creative process as the path I follow to transform my musical raw materials (inspiration, musical vocabulary, talent, experience, libraries, tools, and so on) into a ready-to-integrate, customized musical product (cue, score, song) meeting certain specifications (emotion, mood, style, timing) that center around my client’s desire to communicate a compelling message or story to an audience of media consumers.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCuriously, the term \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ecreative process\u003c/span\u003e is an oxymoron.  On the one hand, \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ecreative \u003c/span\u003econnotes something new, original, unique, unexpected, spontaneous, impulsive, brilliant, inspired, daring, vital, ethereal, and divine – seemingly out of nowhere.  In contrast, \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eprocess \u003c/span\u003esuggests orderly technique, a deliberately-organized series of steps aimed at transforming one thing into another, repeatably, reliably, and efficiently.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThus, in creative process, it’s possible to distinguish two forces at work:  \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ecreativity\u003c/span\u003e, and \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003etechnique\u003c/span\u003e.  They can be interpreted as contrary by nature, one spontaneous, the other predictable.  Yet, in creative process, they co-function in a synergistic, complementary manner.  Think \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eyin \u003c/span\u003eand \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eyang\u003c/span\u003e.  Creativity provides the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ewhat\u003c/span\u003e, technique provides the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ehow \u003c/span\u003eand \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ewhy\u003c/span\u003e.  One can’t do very well without the other.  Creativity unbridled by technique leads to aimlessness:  the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ejob \u003c/span\u003edoesn’t get done.  Technique without creativity leads to uninspired, dull work.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn its purest form, creativity is a sort of magic that somehow crystalizes meaningful \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eideas \u003c/span\u003efrom the murky mist, in which nothing in particular was previously distinguishable – perhaps like the coalescence of the planets, stars, and galaxies out of seemingly nothing at the dawn of the universe.  It is a blind god:  blissfully, capriciously, and enigmatically at play, unfettered by the limits of the concrete and the practical.  Its mantra is \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ewhat if\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ewhat if\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ewhat if\u003c/span\u003e … endlessly.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt’s hard to get at creativity directly.  Ironically, it’s much easier to talk about \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003etechniques \u003c/span\u003ethat can be used to encourage creativity to occur and separate what’s useful from what isn’t.  Thus, for example, creation can often be stimulated by open-minded exploration and discovery in the realm of the unknown.  In effect you keep asking, \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ewhat’s under that rock?\u003c/span\u003e   Rather than seeking the familiar, you’re deliberately thinking about places you \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ehaven’t\u003c/span\u003e looked before, committing yourself to look there, fearlessly.  Overturning each rock, you examine carefully and perhaps find a little world unto itself, home to wonders you’ve never before seen.  Studying it closely, you stumble upon something that inspires you as your mind follows a path not previously traversed.  Suddenly, something clicks.  Some connection is made, and something new bubbles to the surface of your thoughts.  \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eThat’s really cool\u003c/span\u003e, you think.

And now you have in your hand an \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eidea\u003c/span\u003e, which appears, for practical purposes, to be the product of creativity.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNotice that in explaining this view I haven’t described creativity itself, so much as \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eattitude \u003c/span\u003eand \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esystematically applied technique\u003c/span\u003e that increase the probability that creativity will happen and that you’ll notice when it does.

Just like the teaming microcosm under the rock, it’s full of dark, wet, ooky stuff – among which, now and then, an exciting gem waits to be found.  But you have to make yourself look.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn his recent SCOREcast Online article, \u003ca href\u003d\"../../../../../2009/11/list-film-composer-habits-for-any-list.html\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eA-List Film Composer Habits for Any-List Film Schedules\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, Jai Megan reveals that composing film overtures, performing ethnomusicological research, and mining sound libraries are three exploratory techniques that can stimulate fast-track creativity while, at the same time, helping to separate worthy ideas from chaff.

You have to burn substantial calories to bring ideas to the surface, where you can put them to use.  Think of this problem in terms of the exploration technique I described earlier:  you have to turn over the rocks if you want to find the gems that may be lying underneath.  You might have to turn over a lot of them to find anything of value, and you have to think hard about where you’ve already looked and where you haven’t.  And, to stimulate the creative spark, you have to discipline your mind to \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ethink \u003c/span\u003eabout what’s interesting and different about what you’re seeing beneath each rock.

You think you couldn’t bear this unfavorable comparison, so you avoid it by suppressing your own idea generation process.

So you reject too many of your own creative ideas.  Well, sometimes you may have to do that.  But if you do it too often, you’ll end up killing your own creativity.  You have to give sufficient voice to … you.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eNeeding a bigger vocabulary. \u003c/span\u003e  This is like having too few rocks to turn over.

Or, you may experience a seemingly endless gush of ideas that come at you so fast, you can’t capture one before another comes along to distract you.

How long should each transformation take?  Where are the bottlenecks in the process?  Where are opportunities to speed things up by adding more people?

A key source of chaos is the film director, who may not be great at communicating his or her musical vision up front.  If that’s the case, expect lots of changes and iterations before there is firm agreement on the film music.  Moreover, the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003etiming \u003c/span\u003eof each cue is a function of the timing of the picture, which means that if the director decides to make picture changes at the last minute, cues may have to be rewritten.  In the past, the tedium involved in film post-production meant that the picture had to be frozen far in advance of release and directors couldn’t make such last-minute changes.  But digital technologies have sped up post-production to such a degree that late changes to the picture are now common.  This can be extremely disruptive to the film music effort.  Bottom line:  you have to have thick skin, \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eand \u003c/span\u003eyour film music process management system must be robust enough to keep everything straight even in the face of disruption.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe more you think about the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003edetails \u003c/span\u003eof how various things get done, the more questions will arise.

In the process of negotiating that contract, you will have benefitted from knowing in advance who your potential collaborators are and how they will work together.  Ideally, you will even have been in contact with them during the negotiations, describing what needs to be done and to get quotes, time estimates, and availability data in return.  You will have applied this information to develop a rough schedule and budget for the film music, which you could then compare with the money the customer was offering and the deadline being imposed, to convince yourself that you could indeed handle the project with an acceptable level of risk.

Before you even started looking for projects, you and each of your network members have already hammered out the details of \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ehow \u003c/span\u003eyou’ll collaborate when a project materializes – based on your master plan for how your film music machine operates.

If you’re lucky (wise?) enough to live in Los Angeles or another major media production hub, chances are that most of the people you need are practically next-door neighbors.  That can be a significant advantage in terms of time, effort, and money.  If you’re outside of such a media mecca, don’t give up – you’ll have to make some important choices in formulating your plan.  Think systematically about each type of task, interaction, and communication that will need to occur in the process of scoring and producing your film music.  For each one, decide whether the relevant individuals need to be working in physical proximity;  or, conversely, whether collaboration at a distance is feasible and effective.  As a broad generalization, I think you’ll find that tasks related to \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003escoring \u003c/span\u003eare more amenable to distance collaboration;  in contrast, \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003elive production\u003c/span\u003e will require people to be in the same place.  Next, for tasks that require having your collaborators together physically, will you aim to use local resources, or will you (and others) travel?  Traveling to another city to record your score isn’t so unusual.  For example, listen to \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSCOREcast Podcast No. 6\u003c/span\u003e.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eLeveraging the Web for All It’s Worth\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eObviously, the more tasks you can accomplish by remote collaboration, the better, as long as doing so is efficient.  The web can provide the bare-bones medium through which you’ll communicate.  But you’ll need either to find and adapt appropriate \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ecollaboration tools\u003c/span\u003e, or build them yourself (or have someone build them for you).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eEarlier on, we talked about identifying the interactions that need to occur between collaborators (including, by the way, you and your customer) and defining in detail the protocols for all relevant information exchanges.  As I’m sure you know, the film music industry has, over the years, evolved various types of documents – originally on paper – as a means of mechanizing these communications.  I’m talking about key documents such as spotting notes, master cue list, cue breakdown notes, instrument breakdowns, recording session plan, track list, and so on.  Understanding these documents, which which people in the business are already familiar, is a great place to start.  In one way or another, you’ll want to develop the equivalent of these – but online.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere are big advantages to going online, beyond the obvious one of enabling remote collaboration.  You’re better off using online forms than relying on paper, even if your collaborators are working in the same location – because it’s easy for multiple versions of a given document to arise especially when there are a lot of changes (which there will be, for the reasons discussed earlier).  Then, when the schedule is tight and the pressure’s high, one person’s copy of a paper-based document will inevitably get out of sync with another’s, leading to chaos and lost time.  In contrast, you can design a system in which each collaborator accesses the documents he or she needs online (over the web), in a manner such that every individual’s document view is generated on-the-fly from a single, server-based document database which contains the latest data and can identify what’s changed.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThen, there are other types of exchange which also lend themselves to online interaction, given today’s digital technologies.  We’re talking about video clips of film scenes, time code data, sketch scores, MIDI mockups, part scores, conductor’s score, click tracks, recording templates, and so forth.  Toss in methods such as videoconferencing.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe details of how to implement a comprehensive system for gluing a film music team together using web technologies are beyond the scope of the present article.  But it’s fair to say that none of the things I’ve mentioned here are pie-in-the-sky dreams.  They’re well within the reach of a competent web developer using today’s technologies.  I’ll even go so far as to say that most – if not all – of what you need is available off the shelf.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eBottom Line\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf building and commanding your “machine” sounds daunting, maybe it is.  But the basic approach isn’t hard to understand.  First, clarify your vision.  Decide what you’re aiming for, in terms of the class of film music projects you want to be able to take on.  Realize that if your vision is at all ambitious, you’re going to need to create a system of people and processes to handle these projects in a commercially-viable way.  Conceive of your system-building goal as a big task to be accomplished.  Then, as with any big task, break it down into smaller tasks, and tackle them one by one.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eGo forth, divide, and conquer.\u003cdiv class\u003d\"blogger-post-footer\"\u003e\u003cimg width\u003d'1' height\u003d'1' src\u003d'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2957472132698657339-7480874264169164247?l\u003dwww.scorecastonline.com' alt\u003d'' /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"},"link":[{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2957472132698657339/posts/default/7480874264169164247"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2957472132698657339/posts/default/7480874264169164247"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"../../../../../2009/10/to-win-build-machine.html","title":"To Win, Build A Machine"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Jim Well"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"}}],"media$thumbnail":{"xmlns$media":"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/","url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_vV7U0jxn89Q/StVXyDGPcCI/AAAAAAAAADA/yNcP4rkM57g/s72-c/well-insideoutside.png","height":"72","width":"72"}},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2957472132698657339.post-992258179077564482"},"published":{"$t":"2009-09-09T04:00:00.000-07:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2009-09-09T08:00:01.497-07:00"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"computers"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Cubase"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"tools"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"software"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Vista"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"EWQLSO"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"WIVI"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Kontakt"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"systems"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"JW"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"sequencing"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"composing"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Rite of Spring"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"LASS"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"MIDI mockup"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"How Big, How Fast, and Just Plain How"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003ca href\u003d\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_vV7U0jxn89Q/SqdvuGXvMaI/AAAAAAAAAC4/GNusqY4bHVg/s1600-h/well-insideoutside.png\" onblur\u003d\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\"\" border\u003d\"0\" id\u003d\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5379391117692187042\" src\u003d\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_vV7U0jxn89Q/SqdvuGXvMaI/AAAAAAAAAC4/GNusqY4bHVg/s200/well-insideoutside.png\" style\u003d\"cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 136px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 136px;\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003eBack to the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSchool of Chops\u003c/span\u003e.

You can't very well figure out how you're going to work without knowing what your tools are going to be.

For many of us, in this digital age, those tools include a computer or computers, digital audio workstation (DAW) software, virtual instrument (VI) libraries, at least basic audio gear, and perhaps musical instruments (such as a MIDI keyboard) for getting our musical ideas into the computer and/or software programs that hopefully streamline various composing and production tasks.

I’m also not trying to match the interpretation that any particular orchestra, conductor, or engineer may have made of Stravinsky’s work.  I don’t expect to fool an expert listener into thinking he or she is hearing a real orchestra, but I do want the result to be good enough that perhaps the vast majority of lay listeners would accept it as being worth listening to.  I also want it to succeed as a carrier of mood and emotion.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eam \u003c/span\u003eliterally taking Stravinsky’s score (actually, the Dover edition of the full score) and using my MIDI skills and technology assets to produce a MIDI sequence from it, with great care given to the many nuances written into the score and many other nuances that are the result of my own musical interpretation.  The intensive, extended practice steadily improves both my sequencing and my ear.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eExperts will probably find in my MIDI work plenty of things to complain about, with justification.  They will be expecting to hear what they’re accustomed to hearing, based on their knowledge and experience of real orchestras.  In some passages, the MIDI mockup will come very close to “real”, while in other cases I think it’s fair to say that the result will include some elements that sound unfamiliar or aberrant when judged from the perspective of real orchestra.  Yet even these problematic elements can function well and have appeal in their own right.  I think most listeners are far less critical than the experts and can find much to enjoy in this technologically-produced music.  Does it sound like what Stravinsky had in mind?  I don’t know.  Would he roll over in his grave?  Honestly, I doubt it … though he might raise his eyebrows a bit.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBy immersing myself in bringing the score to life, I’m discovering (or re-discovering) plenty about how one can create interesting and compositionally useful sounds using the instruments of traditional orchestra – or, more accurately, the instruments of my particular virtual orchestra.  The process also forces me to learn a great deal about reading scores.  In addition, I find that I encounter – and eventually overcome – one technological hurdle after another.  This is making me increasingly expert at applying all of my tools and, ultimately, is contributing much to the workflow I need to develop.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eSome Early Results\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTo give you an idea what this stuff sounds like, I’ve provided links to two examples.

Of course, you can figure these things out for yourself, but learning the hard way (by trial and error) can make an already expensive proposition even more expensive.  So, here we go.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eThe Computer.  \u003c/span\u003eAfter earlier disappointments with lesser computers – including one specifically designed for music-making – I concluded that half-measures just weren’t going to cut it, and that if I was going to be serious about working with full orchestra, I needed something more powerful.  With what I had, I could neither fit all the VIs of an orchestra at one time, nor run them fast enough to avoid the dreaded pops and clicks (or worse – crashes) that occurred when the CPU or disk couldn’t keep up with the demand for their services.  In addition, it became painfully clear that I was going to need more storage capacity for the better-quality libraries of sample-based VIs (sample disk), for project data including lots of large audio, video, MIDI, and other media (project disk), and for system and application files (system disk) – preferably all on separate drives for performance reasons.  And the motherboard(s) needed to be capable of the very high data throughput implied by fast computing, massive disk I/O, and audio streaming.  Those were just the primary concerns.  There were also many other practical issues related to being able to operate in a more reliable manner, such as being able to make backups of huge amounts of data.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt appeared there were basically two choices:  either a network of synchronized computers (say, a bunch of PCs, Macs, or Muse Receptors) running collaborating software applications, or a bigger, badder single computer.  From years of experience as an engineer, I judged that the multi-machine approach was almost guaranteed to bring its own crop of operational and reliability headaches.  Moreover, it wasn’t likely to be any cheaper than a single, large machine – and maybe more expensive.  Thus, I went with the single, big machine option.  I thought this would enable me to work more or less the same way I had before, when my objectives were much more modest than full orchestra – only now everything would scale up by a large factor.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBigger and badder -- but \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ehow\u003c/span\u003e?  Well, at the time I was considering all of this (about 18 months ago), I was expecting that most or all of my virtual orchestra would be sample-based VIs, like those I could get from \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eEastWest \u003c/span\u003eor \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eVienna\u003c/span\u003e.  I knew that in order to have samples ready to play at the moment they’re needed, sample players (such as EastWest’s \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ePlay \u003c/span\u003eengine or Native Instruments’ \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eKontakt\u003c/span\u003e) need to load some portion of the samples – those that represent the front ends of any notes that might be played – into RAM ahead of time.  While those samples are being played during real-time rendition of a musical composition, the sample player is reading the follow-on samples into RAM from disk.  In theory, if you had a sufficiently fast disk, you could get away without pre-loading any samples into RAM and read them all from disk when needed.  Then you might be able to get by with a relatively small amount of RAM.  But disk systems fast enough for this either don’t exist or would be prohibitively expensive; so, in general, a practical trade-off is made, involving both a lot of RAM, fast disk, and various system optimizations that avoid bottlenecks that could interfere with moving large blocks of data quickly from disk to RAM.  (The said optimizations are much of what you’re presumably paying for when you buy a computer that’s claimed to be specially tuned for digital audio application.)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut – since I didn’t know exactly \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ehow much \u003c/span\u003eof each computing resource was going to be needed, I could by no means be sure I’d need less than 4 Gbytes of RAM.  This amount of RAM is the great dividing line between 32-bit computers and 64-bit computers.  In other words, if your DAW application will use more than 4 Gbytes when all of the needed VIs are loaded, you’ll need a 64-bit computer, because a 32-bit computer can’t address more than 4 Gbytes of RAM (without using tricks that you’d really rather not rely upon).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo I took the plunge for a 64-bit computer, and decided to aim for 16 Gbytes of RAM.  How did I pick 16 Gbytes?  Well, there were three factors.  First, I had been reading that one needed at least 8 Gbytes of RAM to work with a full orchestra, so I took that as a lower limit, even though I couldn’t justify this figure at the time.  Second, the pricing of RAM was such that cost per Gbyte took a sharp upward turn above 16 Gbytes, while the cost to go from 8 Gbytes to 16 Gbytes was not prohibitive.  The third factor was my knowledge that, within limits, one could compensate for having less RAM by having a faster disk.  (Some sample players, such as Kontakt, have a software option that lets you adjust the amount of sample data the player will pre-load into RAM – which is the principal issue affecting total RAM usage.)  My strategy was to configure a very fast dedicated disk drive for my samples – this way, I figured that if a slower disk would force me above 16 Gbytes of RAM, maybe a much faster disk was insurance that 16 Gbytes would be adequate.  As I’ll discuss later, this seems to have proven correct, based on my \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eRite Of Spring\u003c/span\u003e experiences.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe fast sample disk was achieved by adding a RAID controller card to my computer and using four Western Digital \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eRaptor \u003c/span\u003e150-Gbyte drives, combined into a single RAID-0 array with a total formatted capacity of 558 Gbytes.  Even without creating the RAID array, these drives are very fast, turning at 10K RPM and having an access time about half that of more ordinary disks.  This solution was a bit pricey, but it gave me a lot of confidence that disk speed would not be the weak link in my system.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMy computer’s internal system drive, together with the four Raptors, made for a total of 5 internal drives.  I couldn’t put any more than this number inside the box, so I knew that any additional disk, such as for project data storage, additional sample library storage, and backup meant I’d need to use external disk drives.  My initial plan was to use \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eFirewire \u003c/span\u003edrives for all of these purposes, but for reasons that I never fully uncovered, this arrangement never worked reliably or at the performance level I needed for serious productivity.  After about six very painful months of struggling with these problems, I ended up using a bunch of external drives interfaced to the unused SATA ports of my motherboard and RAID controller card.  Two of these physical drives are combined into a single, 930-Gbyte logical drive configured as a RAID-0 array – this drive is used for additional, lower-priority sample libraries that don’t fit on the internal Raptor array.  A third, fixed 465-Gbyte drive stores project data.  A removable fourth drive, also with 465 Gbytes of formatted capacity, is loaded into a drive bay whenever I need to make backups of system or project data.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs I’ve said, the computer’s motherboard needs to be capable of meeting the data throughput demands imposed by having to move massive amounts of sample data from disk to RAM during playback, and, during recording of audio tracks, from RAM to disk as well.  For this purpose, I went with a Windows-compatible computer built around a server-class motherboard (\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eTyan\u003c/span\u003e 5396) that hosts two quad-core \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eIntel Xeon \u003c/span\u003eCPUs, for a total of 8 CPU cores.  These CPUs, the chipset that supports them, and the motherboard design work synergistically to achieve very fast data bus and cache operation, essential to avoid data bottlenecks.  By the way, taking advantage of the multi-CPU architecture requires DAW, VI, and driver software to be written explicitly with this in mind.  Fortunately this has, in fact, been occurring. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhy did I choose a Windows machine and not a Mac?  Well, for one thing, I had been using Windows for the previous 12 years, was comfortable with it, and was using other Windows machines with which I wanted to remain compatible.  I also felt that the Windows world offered more options, and I knew that much of the software I was interested in using was supported on both Mac and PC if I ever decided to move to a Mac.  Finally, at the time, I perceived that Microsoft’s operating systems had somewhat of an edge in supporting 64-bit computing with large amounts of RAM.  So far I haven’t regretted my decision.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe CPU cores operate at a clock speed of 2.67 GHz.  Why did I choose that speed, which is not the fastest available?   Again, a judgment call based on tradeoffs.  First, the cost of higher-speed CPUs increases more rapidly than the extra benefit they deliver – i.e., you get more bang for the buck at middle-level speeds.  Second, a faster CPU may require the other system components (e.g., RAM) to be faster as well – increasing the cost impact.  Third, higher clock rates can mean higher power dissipation, such that your computer runs hotter – and that reduces reliability.  So, I stuck my finger in the wind and chose the middle ground.  My choice has turned out to be adequate.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe motherboard also has quite a few slots for PCI expansion cards.  Experience has shown that having enough of these slots is crucial – I’m using all the slots I have, and would use more if I had them.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOne last detail:  I chose an \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eRME 9652 \u003c/span\u003ecard as my computer’s audio interface.  This choice was made because RME was early in providing a driver that supports 64-bit operation.  The 9652 also has three ADAT input and 3 ADAT output ports, collectively capable of moving up to 24 channels of audio at 48 KHz sample rate.  This is how I move digital audio streams between my computer and my outboard gear, including my A/D-D/A converter.  Most of the time, I use no more than 4 of the 24 audio channels for the type of work I’ve chosen to do – i.e., I’m not trying to create a full-blown recording studio, per se, but rather an environment for MIDI-enabled composing.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eThe Software. \u003c/span\u003e Once I determined that a 64-bit computer was the way I’d go, I was in dangerous territory, because to use such a machine in a way that takes full advantage of RAM above the 4- Gbyte boundary, you have to have software that runs in 64-bit mode.  This includes your operating system, your DAW software, your drivers (such as the driver for your digital audio card and any other piece of hardware integrated into your computer), and as many of your VIs as possible.  At the time I was figuring all of this out (18 months ago), there wasn’t much available that worked in 64-bit mode, and it was unclear how long it would be before the situation improved significantly.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe first decision to be made was which 64-bit operating system to use.  Should it be \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eWindows\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eXP\u003c/span\u003e, with which I was familiar, or \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eWindows Vista\u003c/span\u003e, which implemented more leading-edge technology but about which I’d heard lots of bad press and had even had my own negative experiences?  I was advised to go with \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eVista Ultimate 64-bit\u003c/span\u003e, as XP was seen as a dead-end product and software vendors were designing their products to work under Vista.  Once again, I decided to take a calculated risk – in this case, that things would work out best over time if I went with Vista.  I made this decision, as well as my choice of computer hardware configuration, in combination with the availability of a convincing level of technical support from the computer’s vendor, \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ePC Audio Labs\u003c/span\u003e.  I’ve paid extra for that support, but I figured my shot at business success was conditioned upon having a computer that worked well and had minimum downtime, and the extra cost seemed worth it.  Experience has proven me right.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI decided to use Steinberg’s \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eCubase \u003c/span\u003eas my DAW, for the following reasons:  1) I was familiar with Cubase, liked the way it worked, and didn’t want to be tied to dedicated hardware as would have been the case had I chosen a product such as \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eProTools\u003c/span\u003e;  2) I knew Cubase was a relatively mature product but that a 64-bit product was under development;  and 3) I felt that Steinberg’s pioneering role as developer of the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eVST \u003c/span\u003e(\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eV\u003c/span\u003eirtual \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eS\u003c/span\u003etudio \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eT\u003c/span\u003eechnology) plug-in standard meant that most VI vendors would be sure their plug-ins worked with Cubase.  At the time of my decision, Steinberg was offering only a “preview version” of their 64-bit software (which was later to be introduced on a fully-supported basis with the release of Cubase 5).  This preview version was said to be for those brave souls who needed to be at the bleeding edge of technology.  I figured that while Steinberg was readying a fully-supported 64-bit version, I’d be coming up the learning curve on a lot of other things.  This conjecture proved to be true, and the timing worked out about right.  I’m now running 64-bit Cubase 5.1.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs for virtual instruments from which I can build a complete orchestra, I’m currently using a combination of products from different vendors.  You hear this combination in the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eRite Of Spring\u003c/span\u003e examples.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs I described back in July, I’m using WIVIs for all of my woodwinds and brass.  Since July, I’ve only grown happier with the WIVI approach.  I expect my use of WIVIs will expand over the next year or two as new instruments are introduced and existing ones are improved.  One of the biggest positive impacts of the WIVIs is that they use very little RAM, because they’re based on modeling rather than sampling.  In principle, they also use little CPU.  However, current WIVIs operate only in 32-bit mode, whereas I have a 64-bit environment.  I’m able to use them through the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eVST Bridge\u003c/span\u003e feature of Cubase.  This works by creating a software wrapper around any 32-bit VST plug-in instance;  the wrapper makes the VST instance appear to Cubase as if it’s a 64-bit plug-in, and makes Cubase appear to the VST instance as if it’s a 32-bit DAW.  That’s great except that VST Bridge adds a surprisingly large amount to the total CPU workload, and the amount added is roughly proportional to the number of 32-bit plug-in instances.  If you have a large number of WIVIs, this can easily add up to the single largest component of CPU usage.  Although I find I can live with the actual amount of CPU load I have in the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eRite Of Spring\u003c/span\u003e, I’ve decided to reduce the load by taking advantage of the ability of a WIVI plug-in instance to incorporate more than one virtual instrument.  I’ve used this technique to reduce the number of WIVI plug-ins by a factor of about 5, relative to the number I’d have if I put only one instrument in each plug-in instance.  That has brought my \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eRite Of Spring\u003c/span\u003e CPU usage down to about 60% of what it previously was.  More about these numbers later.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFor strings, I’m using \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eAudiobro\u003c/span\u003e’s recently-introduced \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eLA Scoring Strings\u003c/span\u003e (LASS) library.  This is a sample-based library and, depending on how you use it, is quite capable of filling 16 Gbytes of RAM – which is what I have.  It’s a good thing my WIVIs don’t use much RAM!  My standard LASS setup deliberately creates a great deal of flexibility so that I usually have at my disposal what I need without having to pause in the middle of composing to add something that’s not there.  The downside of this strategy is that it requires a lot of RAM.  If I use LASS’s 24-bit samples, the amount of RAM used is uncomfortably close to 16 Gbytes.  Thus, for most of my work, I use the 16-bit samples, which cuts several Gbytes from my RAM usage (the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eRite Of Spring\u003c/span\u003e MP3s were made using LASS’s 16-bit samples).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLASS samples are hosted by \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eKontakt 3.5\u003c/span\u003e, which is a recently-introduced, 64-bit version of the Kontakt sampler.  I’ve been extremely pleased with how well Kontakt 3.5 has worked with the rest of my 64-bit environment – almost flawlessly.  I use the full version of the Kontakt 3.5 sampler, but you can also use the Kontakt 3.5 player that’s supplied by Audiobro, along with LASS.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLASS, by the way, is a fantastic string library and one of the best acquisitions I’ve made.  Besides the quality of the sound, I especially like the way LASS lets me handle divisi string parts by combining ensembles of different sizes.  Still, I’ve only scratched the surface of what LASS can do.  But as LASS’s many positive attributes are not the main focus of this article, I’ll leave further discussion of those to another day.  There are a few shortcomings.  For example, the initial LASS version includes no col legno samples, which are required by \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eThe Rite Of Spring\u003c/span\u003e.  For those, I used samples from the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eSonic Implants String Collection\u003c/span\u003e, with good result.  In another case, the tail end of one of the Rite Of Spring examples required samples of cello played \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003emarcatissimo\u003c/span\u003e, which LASS didn’t have (there was also a problem of range).

The lion’s share of these (217) are string instruments from the LASS library.  This seemingly large imbalance can be explained by the fact that the LASS instruments are sample-based and have separate samples (which I’m counting as separate instruments) for the various articulations that are supported.  On the wind side, in contrast, all of the instruments are WIVIs, which, by nature, don’t have multiple articulations.  Instead, you get different sounds by varying the many model parameters but chiefly by the way you apply the MIDI breath control (CC2).  In any case, it’s never the case that all 281 instruments are playing at the same time.  The total is probably closer to something in the range from 50 to 75 instruments playing simultaneously.  The number of simultaneous \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003evoices \u003c/span\u003eplaying, however, can be several times this figure.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThese 281 instruments are using about 12.5 Gbytes of RAM.  Given the 3.5 Gbytes left over, I’m happy to report that with everything loaded, the system shows no sluggishness of interactive response;  thus, it’s very easy to work on \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eThe Rite Of Spring\u003c/span\u003e in Cubase.  So far, it hasn’t been necessary to conserve RAM by resorting to any \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003etrack freezing\u003c/span\u003e or, in the case of samples hosted by Kontakt 3 (such as the LASS samples), \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003esample purging\u003c/span\u003e.  These factors are important, because they translate directly into increased productivity. The main adverse consequence of having so much sample data in RAM is that it takes a long time to load and unload projects.  Loading typically takes about 8 to 10 minutes, and unloading between 1 and 2 minutes.  These long times create a disincentive to switching projects – I’ve compensated for this by attempting to have everything I need in the loaded project.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCubase includes a disk activity monitor that seems to suggest that even when the full orchestra is playing the most intensive passages I’ve so far encountered in \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eThe Rite Of Spring\u003c/span\u003e, the main sample drive – the one built using the four Raptors in a RAID-0 array –  isn’t breaking a sweat.  It doesn’t even register on the meter, except at the start of playing.  I’ve never heard a pop that’s characteristic of a disk (or CPU or motherboard) that can’t keep up.  This suggests that I might be able to reduce the amount of RAM I’m using by reducing the value of the RAM pre-load size parameter in Kontakt 3.5.  This would demand more from the disk, but the disk seems to have a lot more to give.  We’ll see.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCPU load and its distribution across the 8 CPU cores can be effectively monitored using the Performance tab of the Task Manager built into Windows Vista.  This monitor shows that during playback of The Rite Of Spring, CPU usage is distributed fairly uniformly among the 8 cores, peaks in the 30% to 35% range in the most intensive passages, and runs from 20% to 25% in less-demanding passages.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAll of these observations add up to the overall conclusion that the system is easily meeting its performance objectives with comfortable margin when handling full-orchestra, real-time playback of complex orchestration.  Given all the blood, sweat, and tears that have gone into getting this far, that’s welcome news indeed.  And if you’ve ever wondered whether these big systems really work – you have your answer.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCould I have gotten by with less?  Perhaps.  But I think that, one way or another, lesser solutions would have exacted painful costs in terms of productivity and/or compromises in the types of material I could attempt to compose.  My goal has been to minimize those costs whenever possible, and it looks like I’ve succeeded.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eDespite all the things I’ve said in this rather long-winded article, there are many topics I’ve omitted.  So if I’ve raised any burning questions in your mind, either technical or artistic, please make a comment and I’ll try to fill the gaps.

There’s a certain interplay between words and music, and it was difficult to settle on the words and rhythmic structure without having some idea of how they’d embed in music.  I also found it difficult to shake off stylistic influences from certain songs and artists I had long admired, so I tried not to fight them.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAfter I’d written a complete set of lyrics and started developing the melody and guitar accompaniment in detail, I found some lyrical changes were necessary to make the marriage of lyrics and music work well.

I figured I’d have a maximum of one day to sequence the guitar part, so I got busy.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWith folk-style finger picking in mind, I wanted the guitar playing to sound as realistic as possible. When sequencing, it’s easy to create a pattern that sounds cool but would be difficult or impossible for a real guitarist to play – and therefore, you’d be unlikely to hear such a pattern in real guitar work.  In real playing, each hand must carefully respect what the other is doing in order to produce a clean, continuous sound that avoids buzzing strings and dull thuds, even at chord changes.  A finger of the left hand (which forms chords) can change position only when doing so will not prematurely terminate a tone sounding on any affected string.  Conversely, a finger of the right hand can pluck a string only when a finger of the left hand isn’t about to move either onto or off of it.  (Exceptions are made for deliberate hammer-ons and pull-offs.)  The resulting choreography is a little like running underneath a herd of stampeding giraffes – it greatly constrains what the guitarist does, and thus puts a certain imprint on a picking and chording pattern that says:  \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ethis sounds real\u003c/span\u003e.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTo make sure my MIDI sequence had this imprint, I used my own playing as a guide.

But \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eBand-in-a-Box\u003c/span\u003e is a very complex product and, like \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eRealGuitar\u003c/span\u003e, functions in a way that makes recreating one’s personal playing style more work than I could deal with in a short amount of time.  So, fairly quickly, I concluded that the fastest way to get the result I needed was also the simplest and most direct:  simply entering all the notes by hand.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWith practice, notes can be hand-entered into a piano roll more quickly than you’d think.

Once again, I analyzed my own playing and found that an emphasis on certain notes was an essential part of the finger-picking style I was sequencing.  To first order, the style had an eighth-note rhythm, but often the stress pattern was \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncopation\"\u003esyncopated\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/span\u003ein one of several ways.  Subdividing a 4/4 measure into eight equal parts numbered from 1 to 8, I found, for example, that in one characteristic pattern, subdivisions 4 and 8 were stressed.  In another lick, the stress was on 1, 4, and 7.  And so on.  And then, there were additional variations reflecting the flow of the song and particularly leading into transitions.  And there was an instrumental break in the middle of the song, which required more emphasis.  So, yes, I went through and edited all the velocities by hand, taking into account all of these factors.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTiming nuances also affected the perception of realism.  For example, I noted that when I play in this particular style, there are times when I pluck two strings, \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003enominally \u003c/span\u003eat the same time.  Generally this is accomplished by a \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003epinching \u003c/span\u003emotion, in which my thumb plucks one of the lower-pitched strings while another finger moves in the opposite direction to pluck a higher string.  However, I usually put a slight \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003edelay \u003c/span\u003ebetween the two notes.  When sequencing, and especially if quantization is turned on, the tendency will be for these two notes to be precisely simultaneous – which doesn’t sound realistic.  You have to put in the delay.  Thus, I searched the song for instances that warranted making deliberate timing adjustments like these, and edited note start and end times accordingly.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI should point out that I had quantization turned \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eoff \u003c/span\u003ewhen entering most of the notes, relying only on the visual grid to guide me.  This practice introduces a certain amount of timing randomness that can help eliminate a machine-like sound.  And on top of my \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003edeliberate \u003c/span\u003evelocity and timing edits, I used \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eCubase \u003c/span\u003eto apply a small amount of randomness to both of these attributes.  But I don’t think that applying randomness, by itself, is a good strategy for obtaining a realistic feel.  It's still necessary to study the nuances of real playing and emulate those deliberately.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI did some tempo editing as well, though probably less than I should have.  \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eCubase\u003c/span\u003e, like most \u003ca href\u003d\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Workstation\"\u003eDAW\u003c/a\u003e applications, makes graphical editing of the tempo contour pretty easy.  I used this mostly in the last verse to provide dramatic rubato.  Although I wanted the tempo to be fairly steady for the most part, I could have improved the interpretation and humanization of the song by judiciously adding rubato in other places.  On the other hand, recording the guitar first meant that in my vocal, I would have had to be very careful to follow the guitar’s timing – the reverse of the leader-follower relationship I’d expect in a real performance.  Having a lot of tempo variation would have added unwanted complication in the face of a short time schedule.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn this particular project, guitar note timings and velocities were the primary things that needed tweaking to get a realistic sound.  However, there were some additional things I could have done that might have provided further improvement.  For example, like many guitar virtual instruments these days, \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eI’m A Blackbird Guitar\u003c/span\u003e offers string noises (those \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eeeek \u003c/span\u003esounds you get when sliding along a wrapped string) that can be deliberately invoked by the MIDI sequence.  However, inserting the right type of noise in the appropriate place requires much more careful study, for which I had no time.  There is also an ability to adjust the envelope of each note (attack/hold/delay/sustain/release), which could probably have improved the quality of each note pluck, had I had the time.  And so on.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBy the way, as a result of selecting an \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eEastWest \u003c/span\u003eguitar for this project, the guitar track had in it a substantial amount of ambience which is characteristic of all of \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eEastWest\u003c/span\u003e’s sample libraries.  I did not use the reverb built into \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eEastWest\u003c/span\u003e’s playback engine (\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003ePlay\u003c/span\u003e) add more to this ambience.  In fact, I might have preferred a dryer guitar, given that my voice was to be recorded dry.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eCapturing the Vocal\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOnce I had the guitar part nailed down in MIDI, I was ready to record my vocal.  This involved using \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eCubase \u003c/span\u003eto play back the guitar part while simultaneously recording my voice on a separate track, while I monitored the guitar by headphone.  I used a \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.rodemic.com/microphone.php?product\u003dK2\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eRode K2\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e vacuum tube condenser microphone with a cardioid pickup pattern, running the mike into an \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.avalondesign.com/vt737sp.html\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eAvalon Vt-737sp\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e channel strip primarily to provide soft compression and a little extra warmth.  For the most part, I set the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eVt-737sp\u003c/span\u003e according to \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eAvalon\u003c/span\u003e’s recommendations for vocals:  about 6dB of treble boost following the compressor, 4:1 compression, -5 dB threshold, attack and release each at 10 o’clock.  (It’s difficult to know exactly what the latter two settings amount to in terms of times.)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWorking at a sample rate of 44.1 KHz, I recorded five takes of the vocal, figuring that none was perfect but that I could pick the best version of each phrase and make a decent composite.  To do this, I lined up the five takes side by side in the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eCubase \u003c/span\u003emain window and went through the song a phrase at a time, each time choosing what I felt was the best take for that phrase.  For each phrase so found, I extracted a chunk of waveform from the relevant take and glued it into the composite I was creating.   This produced \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003emuch \u003c/span\u003ebetter results than if I had simply used any of the five raw takes without compositing – and didn’t require any entire take to be flawless.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNext I used \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.celemony.com/cms/index.php?id\u003dproducts_studio\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eMelodyne Studio\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e to correct my pitch, working manually on each note.  I’ve never been a great singer, and hadn’t sung at all for about four years before making this recording, so you can imagine my pitch control wasn’t so hot.  From a pitch standpoint, the corrected result was very good.  However, a noticeable degree of vocal \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eexpressiveness \u003c/span\u003ewas lost in the process of cleaning up the pitch.  I didn’t recognize the extent of this loss until several hours later, when I was able to make a global assessment of the pitch-corrected vocal.  With hindsight, if I had time to redo the correction, I’d strive for a better balance between pitch correction and preservation of expression.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003ePutting It All Together\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe last step was to mix the vocal and guitar part into single stereo track.  Before mixing, I processed the composite vocal through an instance of the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.celemony.com/cms/index.php?id\u003dproducts_studio\"\u003eTrackPlug\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/span\u003eplug-in from \u003ca href\u003d\"http://wavearts.com/\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eWaveArts\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.  The plug-in was set to roll off the frequencies above 7.6 kHz at -12 dB/octave and apply compression over and above what was done by the \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eVt-737sp\u003c/span\u003e.  The compression parameters at this stage were 4:1 ratio, -17 dB threshold, 0 dB gain, 2 ms attack and 100 ms release, Vintage mode, medium knee.  To balance the guitar with the voice, I dropped the level of the guitar track by 5.6 dB.  No other processing was applied to the guitar before mixing it with the vocal.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI applied reverb to the result of mixing.

In my opinion, this is a very good impulse response library.  Wanting a very close-miked sound, I mixed in only a very small amount of reverb, setting the wet level 26 dB below the dry level.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe last stage of processing was an instance of \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003eWaveArts\u003c/span\u003e’ \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-style: italic;\"\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://wavearts.com/products/plugins/finalplug/\"\u003eFinalPlug\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/span\u003eplug-in, which applies peak limiting and an adjustable degree of compression for volume maximization.
