Comprising of a group of composers\/producers, the Cinematique Instruments team is highly attuned to the needs of the modern composer and manages to continuously come up with unconventional yet highly usable libraries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">Their latest flagship product, <a href=\"http:\/\/cinematique-instruments.com\/page_ensemblia15.php\" target=\"_blank\">Ensemblia<\/a>, is a unique combination of traditional orchestral and rare modern instruments that is aiming to recreate the sound of the modern chamber orchestra and provide composers with an intuitive tool to create natural-sounding productions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">Ensemblia is a KONTAKT-based library that runs on the full version of both KONTAKT 4 and 5 and has recently been updated to version 1.5, adding tons of new features and new instruments. What\u2019s more, following the success of the original Ensemblia library, the Cinematique Instruments team is about to release two further variations, Metallique and Stringed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">So let\u2019s take a look at what this \u2018trio\u2019 can add to your arsenal!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>General Overview<\/h2>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The original library comes with a wealth of sonic colors, from classical orchestral and mallet instruments to odd synths and bowed guitars. But the real beauty of Ensemblia, where all sounds come truly alive, is in the clever Kontakt patch programming. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The entire library is organized in just two patches: Longs and Shorts. The large variety of presets available are accessed via the well thought-out user interface. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Longs<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Longs patch allows you to load up to 7 different instruments, each on a dedicated channel strip that gives you individual control over the volume, panning, reverb, and transposition. The magic, however, lies in the Voicing section where you can determine how each chord you play on the keyboard is distributed to the loaded instruments. For example, you can load all four orchestral strings, each on its individual slot, and instruct Ensemblia to assign the lowest note of your chords to the bass, the highest to the violin and the middle ones to the viola and cello.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As if this isn\u2019t clever enough, the &#8216;Longs&#8217; patch has been programmed in such a way so as to automatically recognize where to assign each new note you play, based on its distance from the previous notes. If, for example, you have a Csus4 chord and the F is assigned to the viola, when you move to a C triad, the E will automatically be played by the viola, too!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While you are free to mix and match the available instruments to your heart\u2019s delight, the CI team has provided a wealth of presets neatly organized into intuitive categories, to suit all tastes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2274\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Longs-Master.png\" alt=\"Longs-Master\" width=\"633\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Longs-Master.png 633w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Longs-Master-389x259.png 389w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Longs-Master-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Shorts<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Shorts patch is excellent for rhythmic figures and ostinato and works in the exact same way (7 instrument slots with individual controls) but it also features an \u201cArranger\u201d page that allows you to program the exact rhythm each instrument is playing. The presets provided are again well thought-out and neatly organized and can give you anything from dark and frantic to light and atmospheric. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In both patches, a comprehensive \u201cMixer\u201d section allows you to shape your sound to taste and make it as subtle or as overpowering as you wish!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2277\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Shorts-Master.png\" alt=\"Shorts-Master\" width=\"633\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Shorts-Master.png 633w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Shorts-Master-389x259.png 389w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Shorts-Master-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px\" \/><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Ensemblia &#8220;<span class=\"s1\"><b>Metallique&#8221;<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 4\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Based on the same principles as the original Ensemblia library, Ensemblia Metallique comprises of a large range of metallic mallet instruments (anything and everything from vibraphone to a salad bowl!), all accessible via a \u201cShorts\u201d patch which allows you to mix and match instruments, program your own rhythms and further shape your sound via the Mixer section.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2276\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Metallique.png\" alt=\"Metallique\" width=\"633\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Metallique.png 633w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Metallique-389x259.png 389w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Metallique-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Ensemblia &#8220;Stringed&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Stringed variation of Ensemblia brings together all the rare and odd string instruments the CI team has ever recorded: autoharp, monochord, kantele, lute, hammered dulcimer, zither and many more. Since these are mostly plucked instruments, Ensemblia Stringed comprises of just the \u201cShorts\u201d patch, but this is enough to satisfy even the most demanding tastes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2278\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Stringed.png\" alt=\"Stringed\" width=\"633\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Stringed.png 633w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Stringed-389x259.png 389w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Stringed-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 4\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>Final Observations<\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 5\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There is an unwritten rule-of-thumb that the smaller the ensemble you are composing\/orchestrating for the more careful you have to be when choosing voicings, voice leading, doublings, etc. This is one of the reasons why it is said that writing for a string quartet, for example, is much harder than writing for a full string orchestra. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The same is true for sample libraries \u2014 large and \u2018epic\u2019 ensembles are often easier to make sound realistic but small and intimate are harder. There are many libraries out there that do the \u2018big\u2019 sound incredibly well, but what happens when your cue demands a smaller, more intimate sound? <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is where Ensemblia\u00a0excels. It is a library that has clearly been designed with the modern composer in mind. It comes to fill a \u2018void\u2019 in the sample library market and it does so incredibly well. Ensemblia offers a large variety of sonic possibilities in an extremely well recorded and programmed package. Added with its beautiful interface, and you have an easy to find your way around the library and create the exact sound you are after. <\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>ENSEMBLIA<\/strong>\u00a0by <a href=\"http:\/\/cinematique-instruments.com\/page_ensemblia15.php\" target=\"_blank\">Cinematique Instruments<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>219 \u20ac\/ $245<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>METALLIQUE<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>115 \u20ac\/ $129<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>STRINGED<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>115 \u20ac\/ $129<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are many libraries out there that do the \u2018big\u2019 sound incredibly well, but what happens when your cue demands a smaller, more intimate sound?
