The result was <strong>Marble<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Marble is a KONTAKT-based library that runs on the full version of KONTAKT 5.3, comes with more than 800 presets, and is comprised of more than 2,500 samples.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>General Overview<\/h2>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At the core of <strong>Marble<\/strong> lie two parallel sound slots (called \u201cTracks\u201d) equipped with their respective 16-step sequencers. But there is a twist; each of these two sequencers is completely \u2018open\u2019 &#8212; in other words, you can tweak every single one of the twelve parameters provided for each sound slot, individually for each of the 16 steps of the sequencer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One of the greatest values of this library is its flexibility and tweakability. Cinematique Instruments essentially provide us with a complex yet extremely intuitive and simple-to-use \u2018system\u2019 that allows us to combine any of the sixty-four sound sources in as many ways as our minds can imagine, sequence them and tweak each step of the sequence individually and, finally, manipulate everything in real time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The beauty of Marble lies at a single rotating ring that controls an entire effects matrix and which can allow you to shape your sound in real time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>THE GUI<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One of the first things I immediately loved about this library is the deceptively simple GUI. It is nicely designed and very neatly organized in a way that makes it easy to navigate. Everything is exactly where you expect it to be and you can create your own complex evolving sounds at the click of a button while being blissfully unaware of the complex mechanics and programming lying \u2018behind the scenes\u2019. <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-2283 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/The-22MASTER22-tab-389x330.png\" alt=\"The %22MASTER%22 tab\" width=\"389\" height=\"330\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/The-22MASTER22-tab-389x330.png 389w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/The-22MASTER22-tab-300x254.png 300w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/The-22MASTER22-tab.png 629w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\" \/> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The entire <strong>Marble<\/strong> library is accessible via a single Kontakt-instrument patch that is organized into 4 tabs : <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1. The \u201cPRESETS\u201d tab allows you to choose any of the included 800 presets at the click of a button. Presets have been organized into categories and sub-categories that are sure to strike a cord with every modern composer, including Ambiences, Bass Lines, Sequences, Drum Beats, Rhythm Essentials and more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2. The \u201cTRACKS\u201d tab is where you can select a different sound source for each of the two \u201cTracks\u201d and set the values for each of the two \u2018open\u2019 step sequencers. You can customize parameters such as velocity, note length, pan, tuning, shape, filter, LFO stutter, reverb, delay, time shifting and playing direction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">3. The final sound\/combination of the two tracks then passes through a complex effect matrix which you can customize and control in Real-Time through the \u201cASSIGN\u201d tab. A 127-step sequencer allows you to easily assign parameter values for each of the onboard effects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">4. Finally, the \u201cMASTER\u201d tab is where you can tweak your sound with a simple turning of the Marble ring (which is connected to the effects matrix at the \u201cASSIGN\u201d tab), \u201cFreeze\u201d the sound if you wish to play along with the created sequence and set quantization and tempo parameters. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Malleability<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">One thing Cinematique Instruments seems to have down really well is all the built-in ways you can mold and fashion their original sample sources into your own unique<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2285\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/The-22TRACKS22-tab-389x329.png\" alt=\"The %22TRACKS%22 tab\" width=\"389\" height=\"329\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/The-22TRACKS22-tab-389x329.png 389w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/The-22TRACKS22-tab-300x254.png 300w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/The-22TRACKS22-tab.png 635w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\" \/> finished material sounds. With included sound sources such as drum kits, acoustic and electric basses, struck percussion, experimental\u00a0string FX, woodwinds,\u00a0classic synthesizers, skin percussions, glitch FX and electronic oddities galore, your possibilities are virtually endless.\u00a0After you tweak to your heart&#8217;s delight, you can run the finished shape through <strong>Marble&#8217;s<\/strong> deep FX matrix. This process houses an extensive effects rack module, which includes low and high pass filters, face-ripping distortions, multi-band compression, randomizers, reverbs and more. By simply applying any one or combination of these parameters to your creation, Marble takes on a completely different vibe and enables you to throw your own voicings behind typically traditional instrument sources, making them perfect for video game music, trailer music production, film and TV work, or experimental media applications.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And\u2026\u2026 all of this can happen in Real Time. If you are a live stage performer, this is a huge advantage that most sound libraries are slowly becoming hip to, but <strong>Marble<\/strong> gets exactly right directly out of the box. Every parameter is flexible on the fly and can be recorded with DAW automation for recall later on or real-time experimental performance \u2013 a major asset for the live player or experimental tweakhead composer.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 4\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 4\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h2>Final Observations<\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 5\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Marble<\/strong> is a well-designed library that has clearly been created with a lot of forethought into how modern composers like to work and create. The sounds providing the raw material are top quality and have been recorded to Cinematique Instruments\u2019 excellent standards. The \u2018open\u2019 16-step sequencers offer a myriad of sonic possibilities and the fact that the effects matrix offers Real-Time dynamic sound shaping is, in my opinion, this library\u2019s greatest asset. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Marble<\/strong> is extremely playable and a lot of thought has evidently gone into creating a playable instrument that responds well to both chords and melodic lines, allowing users the freedom to create their own unique soundscapes via a simple and intuitive interface. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Once again, Cinematique Instruments have created an excellent product that can easily find its way into any modern composer\u2019s arsenal.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>MARBLE<\/strong>\u00a0by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cinematique-instruments.com\/page_marble.php\" target=\"_blank\">Cinematique Instruments<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>240 \u20ac\/ $270<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For live and on-the-fly sound shaping that features well-recorded source material bundled with extensive effects options, Marble might be your new go-to tool.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":24,"featured_media":2285,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_is_tweetstorm":false},"categories":[1307],"tags":[1340,983,1277,1339,1336],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/The-22TRACKS22-tab.png","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/s202Ia-marble","_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2280"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/24"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2280"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2280\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2285"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2280"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2280"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2280"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
