				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe src="https://widget.spreaker.com/player?episode_id=8919298&#038;theme=light&#038;playlist=false&#038;playlist-continuous=false&#038;autoplay=false&#038;live-autoplay=false&#038;chapters-image=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Hot of the success of his score for <em>Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation</em>, composer <strong><a href="http://www.joekraemer.com/" target="_blank">Joe Kraemer</a></strong> sits in with Deane and Brian for the first SCOREcast episode of the year. The trio talk through how Joe approached writing music for one of the biggest franchises in cinematic history and then enjoy some composer banter over the latest piece of another big franchise you may have heard of… a little film called <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em>. But before all that, Deane has a conversation with Logic expert <strong><a href="http://dingdingmusic.com/DingDing/Buy.html" target="_blank">Edgar Rothermich</a></strong>, author of the <a href="http://dingdingmusic.com/DingDing/Manuals.html" target="_blank">GEM</a> series of Logic tutorial texts, about why both composers choose Logic as their DAW and Edgar&#8217;s philosophy of deeply understanding your composing tools.</p>

Last November, Deane and Brian took on the great James Horner… and got a ton of email for it. Not against taking on Horner, but in favor of their next autopsy victim being the legendary Alan Silvestri. 2015 marks the 30th anniversary of the release of BACK TO THE FUTURE and the boys devote their second Sacred Score Postmortem to a real-time rip-roaring ride through Silvestri&#8217;s breathtaking action/adventure masterpiece. Also, in a rare full-tilt rant, Brian says the F-word for the first time on the show. Well, there&#8217;s other important stuff, too… but… ahem… BRIAN SAYS THE F-WORD FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THE SHOW!!!!</p>

You also don&#8217;t jack around with sacred cow film scores… a memo that Deane and Brian clearly missed as they talk scene-by-scene through one of the most beloved film scores of all time, James Horner&#8217;s &#8220;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&#8221;. Also, David Saunders, SCOREcast&#8217;s Director of Global Community, stops by to announce the new SCOREcast: Amsterdam community.</p>

Deane and Brian return from a two month break to chat with acclaimed Hollywood composer and orchestrator Conrad Pope about his life in music, his long-standing working relationship with John Williams, and his experience on this summer&#8217;s monster hit, Godzilla. Conrad also offers his thoughts on the Los Angeles musicians union saga, his first ever film score job, <em>The Rocketeer</em>, and how MIDI can positively or negatively affect a film score. Deane and Brian also squeeze in a discussion on the very prickly subject of the value of your reputation as a private person versus your reputation as a professional entity.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In this second article about orchestrating for strings, Stellita Loukas looks at ways in which harmony can be orchestrated within the string section with or without doublings in other orchestral sections. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Hello everyone! I hope you are all well and deep into creative frenzy! Following my article on how to orchestrate the melody within the string section, in this article I would like to explain various ways in which we can give the harmony to the string section. While Mr.Korsakov and &#8220;Principles of Orchestration Online&#8221; have done a brilliant job of explaining these principles, I would like to present the material in a more concise and organized way. So, as is our customary ritual, grab a fresh cup of your preferred beverage and let&#8217;s get started!</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the nature of the string section and the fact that all four instrument families blend perfectly with each other, string harmony is one of the easiest to write. However, it is also one of the most important! As we mentioned in the last article, strings are the backbone of the orchestra. If you create a solid basis for the entire orchestra to &#8216;sit&#8217; on, then chances are your orchestration will sound much much better. The most important goal when writing string harmonies is to achieve an equal balance of the harmonic parts.</p>
<h1>A. Preparing to Orchestrate &#8211; Brush up your Part-Writing!</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you were looking for a chance to brush up your part-writing skills, now is the perfect time! However big and lush your string patches may sound, bad part-writing cannot be corrected neither in the orchestration nor in the mixing stage. So, the first step in successfully and effectively orchestrating your harmony in the string section is to have a nicely-crafted harmony to begin with. Make sure that each chord flows into the next as smoothly as possible and each instrument has a playable and interesting line.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keep in mind that the smaller the string ensemble you have available, the more exposed your part-writing will be. However surprising, it is true that it is much harder to make a string quartet sound good than a full string orchestra! So next time you are having a hard time concentrating in all those harmony rules we all had to ‘digest’ at some point, remember that!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next step is to take your 3-, 4- or X-part harmony and assign each line to a string family. Let me clarify here that when I refer to 3-part harmony I don’t necessarily mean triadic harmony (i.e. chords comprising of Root-3rd-5th) but any chord comprising of 3 parts. Also, ‘4-part harmony’ refers to any chord structure that comprises of four notes (R-3-5-7 or R-3-5-9 etc). Any 3-part structure can be turned into a 4-part structure with doubling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The standard and most straightforward approach to orchestrating any chord in the string section is to assign chord tones according to the range and role of the instrument. For example, the obvious choice for the top note(s) of the chord are the violins and for the bottom are the basses.  Another thing to always have in mind is that while close voicings sound well in higher registers, it is best for the lower notes to be spaced in larger intervals because close intervals between basses and cellos will sound very muddy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our very own Robin Hoffmann has written an excellent article on how to voice a chord according to the harmonic series. I suggest that you give it a <a href="http://www.robin-hoffmann.com/tutorials/articles/tutorial-the-harmonic-series/">read</a> as it will help you understand a lot about voicing chords for the string section. No matter what kind of harmony you are using, spacing the notes correctly is a make-or-break factor in successful string writing. Voicings are everything!</p>
<h1 style="text-align: justify;">B. Orchestrating the Harmony within the String Section</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">1. Harmony in 3 to 5 Parts</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Harmony in 3-5 parts is rather straightforward, in the sense that the string section allows us to write up to 5 parts without problems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we are faced with a harmony in 3-parts, we can either omit some string instruments (e.g. have only Violins-Violas-Celli) or we can always double some chord tones to create extra parts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 4-part harmony, when our chords are essentially triads, the common practice is to give the bassline to the cellos and double basses either in unison or in octaves. If the bassline is too busy, a common technique is to give the basses a simplified version of it. For example, if the cellos play a rather busy legato basslines, we can have the basses playing a simplified pizzicato bassline, giving our harmony parts a bit more ‘bounce’.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2. Harmony in more than 5 Parts</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is where things get interesting! When our harmony comprises of more than 5 parts, we have two choices; we can either divide each of the string families to derive extra parts or write so-called &#8216;multiple stops&#8217;.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">2.1 Divisi Strings</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Learning to write for divided (i.e. <em>divisi</em>) strings is a lifelong pursuit and requires a lot of practice and experience. There are, however, some general guidelines that can help us get started and this is what we are going to touch upon in this section. While here we are going to talk about <em>divisi a 2 </em>(i.e. dividing each section in 2 parts), these guidelines can be adapted and applied to any other configuration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each string section can be divided into 2, 3 or even 4 parts, depending on the size of the section. If our string ensemble is very limited in size, <em>divisi </em>writing will either be infeasible or impractical.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a general rule, the minimum number of players per harmony part should be between 3 and 4. Any less than that will result in an imbalanced tone colour. For example, violas should only be divided if there are 8 or more available and violins should be divided only if there are 6 or more.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">So, when SHOULD we use <em>divisi</em> strings?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Divided strings are usually used when we are after a thin sound. For the Big Hollywood sound, it is much better to use double stops.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Some Ideas for distributing <em>divisi </em>strings :</h4>
<p><a href="../../../?attachment_id=1551" rel="attachment wp-att-1551"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1551" title="Divisi_Formuli" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Divisi_Formuli-640x480.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Divisi_Formuli-640x480.jpg 640w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Divisi_Formuli-160x120.jpg 160w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Divisi_Formuli-389x291.jpg 389w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Divisi_Formuli.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3> 2.2 Double and Multiple Stops</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each string instrument can be turned into a polyphonic instrument if the player stops two or more notes at the same time. For any multiple stop to be feasible, each note must be located on a different string.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a general rule, all double stops including an open string are easy to play.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to be able to write successful multiple stops for strings, a thorough examination of playing positions of each instrument is required. The table below shows some of the easy and possible double stops in each instrument. The MIDI notes refer to the bottom note of the interval.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="../../../?attachment_id=1552" rel="attachment wp-att-1552"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1552" title="Double_Stops" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Double_Stops-640x480.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Double_Stops-640x480.jpg 640w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Double_Stops-160x120.jpg 160w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Double_Stops-389x291.jpg 389w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Double_Stops.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When writing multiple stops, bear the following in mind :</p>
<ul>
<li>Triple and quadruple stops can only be executed rapidly and slightly arpeggiated, due to the &#8216;curved&#8217; nature of the instruments&#8217; bridge.</li>
<li>When writing multiple stops, the two factors you should account for first and foremost are : resonance of chords and ease of execution.</li>
<li>Multiple stops are usually assigned to violins and violas and less often to cellos.</li>
<li>When asking a player to perform a multiple stop give them ample time to prepare their positions. For example, a fast run cannot end on a multiple stop because the players will not have time to prepare the multiple stop.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Special-Purpose Chords</h2>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">3.1 Short Accented Chords</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Short and sharp chords can be played using multiple stops for extra strength and accent. A very good example of this is the so-called &#8220;Tchaikovsky Chord&#8221;, explained at a later section of this article.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">3.2 Tutti Pizzicato Chords</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tutti chords are usually employed only if we are after a special effect and only for a short period of time. Continuous use of these chords lessens their impact and tires the listener!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pizzicato strings are usually used in the following manners :</p>
<ul>
<li>One or all string families playing pizzicato, accompanying a solo instrument;</li>
<li>As accents to emphasize important rhythmic moments of the melody of the composition;</li>
<li>Combined with sustained harmony; the basses are often divided in two sections, half playing the bassline pizzicato and the other half arco.</li>
<li>Pizzicato strings playing chords with multiple stops (for extra strength and accent);</li>
<li>To play driving rhythms; for an extra &#8216;driving&#8217; element, these pizzicato chords are usually combined with low brass;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">As I have found out recently, pizzicato strings blend beautifully with tuned percussion instruments such as marimbas when playing upbeat melodies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tutti pizzicato consists of the entire string section playing pizzicato, usually doubled by woodwinds and brass. Tutti pizzicato chords are occasionally reinforced by harp and piano.</p>
<h4>3.3 Sustained and Tremolo Chords</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sustained harmony needs a lot more attention on our part because it is much more prominent. A perfect balance of tone is the first and most important goal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Assuming that all string families are equal in power (i.e. comprise of a balanced number of players), the most frequent arrangement of chord tones is according to register, with the bassline doubled in unison or octaves :</p>
<ul>
<li>Melody (also called Soprano in part-writing) : 1st Violins</li>
<li>Harmony note 1 (also called Alto) : 2nd Violins</li>
<li>Harmony note 2 (also called Tenor) : Violas</li>
<li>Bassline : Cellos and Basses in unison or octaves</li>
</ul>
<p>When we want to add notes and reinforce the middle register it is preferable to double notes on the violins or violas. As a rule of thumb, the further apart those doublings are from the bass, the better. Of course, in order to create those doublings we will need to either write multiple stops or divide some string families. The best &#8216;candidates&#8217; for <em>divisi </em>writing in this case are the violas. Violas, being &#8216;hidden&#8217; in the middle of the string section in terms of register, are more easily &#8216;digested&#8217; by the ear when being divided.</p>
<p>Another thing you should be careful of is dividing the higher strings (violins and violas) when the lower ones play non-divisi. Such an arrangement results in a heavy sound and you should balance it in other sections of the orchestra.</p>
<p>Finally, in sustained or <em>forte</em> double stops performed tremolo, we are allowed to &#8216;bend&#8217; the part-writing rules in order to ensure ease of execution.</p>
<h1>C. Doubling the String Harmony in other Sections</h1>
<h2>1. Strings and Woodwinds</h2>
<p>The best candidates for doubling in strings and woodwinds are long sustained or tremolo chords (plenty of examples in the Star Wars suite!!). When we want to double string chords in woodwinds, we have the following choices :</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete doubling of chords according to register (Flutes with Violins, Oboes with Violas, Clarinets with Celli etc).</li>
<li>Flutes and Oboes with Violins <em>divisi</em></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Clarinets and Bassoons with Violas and Cellos <em>divisi</em></li>
</ul>
<p>While they sound &#8216;grande&#8217; and please our ears, full and exact doublings should be used only when we are after a particular effect and not for long periods of time.</p>
<p>A very common technique is to have a sustained harmony in the string section and double with woodwinds playing more rhythmic variations of the string lines for extra motion.</p>
<p>The best practice when combining strings and other sections to play the harmony is to make each section complete in itself before considering any doublings. Also, trying to give each section a different voice-leading (i.e. connection of chords) will ensure that we avoid parallels as much as possible. If parallels cannot be avoided, they should better reside in the inner parts of each section.</p>
<h2>2. Strings and Brass</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The combination of strings and brass to play the harmony is a much harder one to get right. The best approach for a nicely blended and balanced tone is to use crossing of parts, enclosure or juxtaposition.  Again, the best approach is to make each section complete in itself with independent voice-leading.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Doubling strings with brass tends to produce a full and heavy sound. If we are after a more transparent effect, we can always reduce the number of brass instruments or omit some if desired. For example, we can only use French horns or Trumpets and Trombones instead of all three. Also, for added transparency, brass harmony should be written mainly in open intervals (fifths and octaves).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If exact doublings are desired, we have a number of choices :</p>
<ul>
<li>Harmony by tremolo strings, sustained chords by brass, doublings according to register relevance (Vln-Tpt, Vla-F.H, Vlc-Trb, CB-Tb);</li>
<li>Strings playing short and disconnected <em>sforzando </em>chords, accented by brass;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">French horns doubling divided violas or cellos.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Strings, Woodwinds and Brass</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The combination of all three instrument sections produces a heavy, full and round tone and should only be used for special effects rather than as common practice. Try to make each instrument section sound good on its own and when possible use independent voice-leading to avoid excessive use of parallels. When doubling string harmony in both woodwinds and brass, the most important factor we must account for is balance and distribution of tone colour.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Tchaikovsky Chord</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Berklee&#8217;s Mr.Ben Newhouse has written a fantastic article about the Tchaikovsky chord on his <a href="http://bennewhouse.berkleemusicblogs.com/2009/10/14/chord-voicings-tchaikovsky/">blog</a>. While I am going to present the essence here, I strongly advise you to visit his blog and read in more detail!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Tchaikovsky chord is a short, accented chord presented in Tchaikovksy&#8217;s 6th Symphony. It is a tutti chord where all strings play quadruple stops, doubled in the woodwinds and brass. In reality, the Tchaikovsky chord is only a G major triad, cleverly voiced according to the overtone (harmonic) series and doubled in all 3 groups of instruments, producing a &#8216;massive&#8217; accent effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking from the bottom to top, the root has been doubled 5 times, the third of the triad has been doubled 3 times and the fifth only two times. The distribution of the full chord is (from top to bottom) :</p>
<p>G6 : Violins I + Flutes 1-2 + Piccolo</p>
<p>B5 : Violins II + Oboe 1</p>
<p>G5 : Violins I + Clarinet 1 + Trumpet 1</p>
<p>D5 : Violins II + Clarinet 2 + Oboe 2</p>
<p>B4 : Violas + French Horns 1+3</p>
<p>G4 : Violins II + Trumpet 2</p>
<p>D4 : Violins I + Violas + French Horns 2+4</p>
<p>B3 : Trombone 1</p>
<p>G3 : Violins I + Violins II + Violas + Trombone 2</p>
<p>G2 : Cellos + Bassoon + Trombone 3</p>
<p>G1 : Basses + Tuba</p>
<div>
<p>If you are a &#8216;formula-maniac&#8217; like myself, here&#8217;s the formula for the chord :</p>
<p>Root 8vb &#8211; Root &#8211; GMaj triad 8va &#8211; GMaj triad 2 8va &#8211; Root &#8211; 3rd &#8211; Root</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you observe the voicing of the chord you will see that (as indicated by the overtone series), intervals at the bottom of the voicing are large (mainly octaves) and as we go higher and higher intervals get smaller, thus ensuring a full wet clear sound. Also, one chord tone (D6) has been omitted just below the top note in order to separate the entire voicing from the top note and make the latter sound more like a melody rather than just another chord tone.</p>
<h4> That&#8217;s all Folks!!</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I hope that this article gave you a few ideas on how you can orchestrate your harmony within the string section. While the information and techniques presented here are by no means exhaustive, they can give you a starting point to begin exploring the vast world of orchestrating for strings!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stay tuned because ScoreCAST University will be shortly presenting you with advice and tips on how to sequence and mix your string section!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Musicologist Yaiza Varona travels back in time and examines the various factors that led to the birth and shaping of the orchestra as we know it today. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Disclaimer: Gods of Musicology, forgive me for I am about to make some very wide generalizations in the name of amusement and general knowledge&#8230;</em></p>
<h3>Why do we use Orchestras?</h3>
<h6>Money, money, money (and huge compression) &#8230;</h6>
<p style="text-align: left;">It was in late Renaissance/Baroque when the show business was really born. Someone had the brilliant idea of charging an entrance fee to publicly-held events (including music performances). These events became the meeting point where different social classes would stare at each other in astonishment and complete lack of understanding (both poor and rich people were seriously amused by each other) but having something very important in common; they had all paid for it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The concept of charging for musical events completely changed the nature of performance. Now, the more people attended the event the greater the profits for the organizer would be. This meant that increasing ticket sales became number one priority and in order to achieve that, the music should be made available to a larger audience. With the smaller ensembles previously used (think of Chamber music) the business wouldn’t have been so successful&#8230;.This development was parallel to the one of Bel Canto, following the same criterion: raising the volume!! If the singer couldn’t be heard in the last row, that row wouldn’t pay for their ticket.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of course, it also meant that not only the music should reach the entire audience physically by means of a higher volume but it also had to reach them emotionally so that they would come back to the event&#8230;.and this defined the writing of a great part of music until the 20th century (but this is another story!).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, back to the orchestra; what else was caused by this increase of ensemble sizes and the need for music to emotionally ‘move’ the audience? Well, complex harmony! Right then and there arose the need for instruments that would tune perfectly with each other, otherwise playing together would become a nightmare of harmonics, dissonances and other evil acoustic phenomena. If you have ever written anything for micro-tuning world instruments you’ll immediately understand what I mean! And even tuned perfectly, you need to provide them with music that will actually sound nice!</p>
<p>By the way, that same time is when conductors also showed up for the first time in history (for smaller ensemble sizes there was no need for someone external to coordinate). The first conductors where the composers themselves, usually giving instructions from their harpsichords while accompanying the performers &#8211; that could have been you! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3>Darwin and the Orchestra</h3>
<h6>The survival of the fittest instruments &#8230;</h6>
<p>With all this in mind, it’s easy to understand that the instruments which survived through history were the ones that could be easily tuned with each other and could play at high volumes (Bye bye harpsichord! Nice having played you viola da gamba!). The instruments we see today in orchestras are fierce predators that pushed out all their competition by tuning better and achieving a higher volume. And it’s a tough ecosystem in perfect balance! Each little instrument has its own niche and they tend not to compete for range or, if they do, their very different timbres make them target a different place in the audience’s hearing range and attention. The orchestra is a diabolic, perfectly-tuned machine that can play the most varied works ever thought of, with hundreds of years of experience and refinement in its technique&#8230;.and it’s coming for you!!</p>
<h3>Meet the Strings, the Brass, the Woodwinds and the Percussion!</h3>
<h6>Why those families of instruments?</h6>
<p>The key to the success of the orchestra as the most amazing musical instrument is balance. The number of members and their nature has been defined and refined over and over again through history, always seeking balance in the sound and versatility in the performance. The specific features of each family of instruments have been studied so they blend together perfectly and in balance, not mudding each other and covering as much of the hearing and attention spectrum as possible. For example, the strings need a larger number of members and act like an army – they need to compete in volume with the brass. The woodwinds, on the other hand, don´t need such a large number of members since they can very well “cut through the mix”. Then again, when the orchestra has “guests” such as a piano, harp or bel canto singers it must be rearranged either in the orchestration or on the components so they also have a niche where they can properly develop.</p>
<h6>So what determines their seating on stage?</h6>
<p>The issue of seating has also varied largely through history, in the search of different effects and colours in the works performed. However, some things usually remain constant due to common sense (at least in live performances &#8230; studio recording is another story!) : percussion and brass are seated in the background or the audience would never be able to hear the strings; the violins and violas will most likely be seated on the left side of the stage so the bodies of their instruments face the audience, directing the maximum volume towards them.</p>
<h6>This all sounds very interesting&#8230;Can I have some names and dates that I can accidentally drop in a conversation so it looks like I have read many manuals about this?</h6>
<p>“Orchestra” comes from Greek “orchistra”, meaning “a dancing place”, and it designated the area in Ancient Greek theaters where the performance would take place. Funnily enough, back in the day the musicians were not always placed there!</p>
<p>It isn´t until beginning of 7th Century that Isidore of Seville used the term for meaning “stage” in his Etymologiarium (in general, Isidore of Seville is one of those names that you can accidentally drop just because, he seemed to have an opinion on everything).</p>
<h5>I would like to know more about this&#8230;</h5>
<p>Yeah, me too!! (Ok, here you are some sources worth taking a look at:)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This morning, we arrived at the Musicave to find numerous emails from SCO readers pointing to an <a href="http://www.adaptistration.com/2010/12/01/joe-horowitz-orchestra-musicians-should-no-longer-expect-to-work-full-time/" target="_blank">article</a> written by Drew McManus (if you are interested in &#8220;orchestra management&#8221;, but you don&#8217;t read <a href="http://www.adaptistration.com/" target="_blank">Drew&#8217;s blog</a> regularly, you should). Drew&#8217;s article calls attention to several controversial statements allegedly made by author Joe Horowitz concerning the plight of full-time work for orchestral musicians, and more specifically, the ongoing labor disputes in the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.</p>
<p>But the giant elephant in the room is something that was recently discussed in a private community meeting that A-list Hollywood oboist Tom Boyd and SCO founder Deane Ogden put together in late September.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The original topic: How to get more film scoring dates to come back to Los Angeles.<br />
The NEW topic: Does anybody <em>care</em>?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the spirit of  discussion which makes <em>SCOREcastOnline.com</em> what it is, we go to YOU—the actual people being affected here.</p>
<p>Read this <a href="http://www.adaptistration.com/2010/12/01/joe-horowitz-orchestra-musicians-should-no-longer-expect-to-work-full-time/" target="_blank">article</a> (and the associated links therein) and tell us what you think if it all. Are musicians living in a fantasy world? What&#8217;s YOUR take?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/08/sig-stambler.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-720" title="sig-stambler" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/08/sig-stambler.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>We were scoring a film on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ0FzrGtfs0">Newman Scoring Stage</a> last Friday. At take 282 <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=2338142&amp;l=af8f6852cc&amp;id=631393172">Rick Marvin</a>, our composer, wondered how many takes we would accumulate by the time we finished our fifth session on the day this article posts. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=2339640&amp;l=d2903f2a9f&amp;id=631393172">Vinny “Smart Water” Cirilli</a>, our Protools Recordist, and software virtuoso of <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/vcirilli/CueChronicle/">CueChronicle</a> said, “I wonder how many takes &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" title="The Simpsons" rel="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096697/">The Simpsons</a>&#8221; are up to?” We found out that “The Simpsons”, which had scored mostly at Fox, was at the take thirty thousand mark.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, up until a couple of months ago I had no idea most T.V. shows were scored in the box &#8211; that’s how long it’s been since I worked in TV. In my day everything was scored with an orchestra of about thirty players. I started in T.V. and we scored five shows a week, every week. I’m aware of what a composer can achieve from today’s synth studio, but I still feel badly for the thousands of sessions lost to the incredible <a href="http://www.afm.org/locals/info/number/47">Local 47</a> musicians. In this regard I don’t think technology is our friend. I asked a session player friend to comment on this and they were reluctant to do so. I understand the reasons.</p>
<p>Are today’s T.V. scores better then they were in my day? I don’t know the answer to that. I can tell you that the composers I worked with wrote to timing notes which detailed everything that happened in the particular picture sequences they were writing. This forced the composer to hit their ‘anchor points’ of dialogue and cuts. Funny how you don’t see much of that these days even though the composer has digital picture. The go-to book in my day was called “Scoring For Films” by the composer <a href="http://www.earlehagen.net/">Earle Hagen</a>.  If you’re studying composition it might be worth a look see. Another interesting film music book from &#8216;the old days&#8221; is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=7ozTus2HZbsC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Film+music++By+Roy+M.+Prendergast#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">Film Music by Roy Prendergast.</a> I included this link because it detailed the kind of work we did as music editors. That illustration is a bar breakdown chart, where you can see the timings of the action and the cuts above the written music.</p>
<p>Another concept worth noting are today’s main titles vs the classic main titles. Check it out. I would love to hear your feedback on what makes a great Main Title. I still love the themes I can remember. It always made the show a bit more fun and exciting to watch, but that&#8217;s my take. It just takes mentioning &#8220;The Love Boat&#8221;, &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" title="Gilligan's Island" rel="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057751/">Gilligan&#8217;s Island</a>&#8220;, or &#8220;Hill St. Blues&#8221; and you have that tune in your head. Am I right? For me, that&#8217;s the stuff great main titles contain. What are your favorites?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five years ago today, one of the greatest melodists to ever pick up the baton left us.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000025/">Jerry Goldsmith</a> was not only a master interpreter of film, but also one of the greatest creators of film music to ever grace the medium. Goldsmith&#8217;s music, whether by accident or pure purpose, was a major influence on many of us in our decisions to take on this career and try to reach even a fraction of the height that he was able to during his time at the podium.</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that when Jerry Goldsmith passed, so did something else&#8230; the</p>
<p class="zemanta-img zemanta-action-dragged" style="margin: 1em; float: right; display: block;"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jerry%2BGoldsmith"><img style="display: block;" src="http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/2148656.jpg" alt="Jerry Goldsmith" /></a><span class="zemanta-img-attribution"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jerry%2BGoldsmith">Jerry Goldsmith</a> via <a href="http://www.lasftm.com">last.fm</a></span></p>
<p>matic writing. It will surely be argued that <a class="zem_slink" title="John Williams" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002354/" rel="imdb">John Williams</a> is perhaps the last &#8220;living legend&#8221; in film music. However, I felt that once Jerry was gone, even Williams began to rest on his laurels a little, and with the latest <span style="font-style: italic;">Indiana Jones</span> film, trail a bit into what I&#8217;ve heard termed as &#8220;smash-and-grab&#8221; scoring.</p>
<p>I first heard the term &#8220;smash-and-grab&#8221; in a lecture during my second year at USC. The lecturer was referring to the types of scores that emphasize bombastic and chaotic &#8220;noise&#8221; over carefully-crafted, thematic writing. You know, the kind that almost every big-budget studio feature has affixed to their tent-pole summer films these days!</p>
<p>It seems that now, more than ever, that the recipe for &#8220;scoring&#8221; is to hold down a key on a controller to loop a gigantic taiko sequence, then, on the second pass, hold another key down and add the Absynth pad to give the new &#8220;cue&#8221; some depth. Furthermore, with the advent of things like &#8220;Symphobia&#8221; and the forthcoming &#8220;Hollywood Strings&#8221; libraries, it is easier than ever to be lazy and still sound amazing. It seems lately that even with the most effort put forth, a composer might write a bare theme, but nothing that is hummable as you walk out of the theater or attaches any kind of musical memory to the film for the audience.</p>
<p>In the wake of Deane&#8217;s question from <a href="../../../2009/07/fixers.html">yesterday</a> about a score&#8217;s affect on a film, I wonder what it is that has made the &#8220;smash-and-grab&#8221; score so trendy lately. Who started the downward spiral and why are the studios so happy to buy in? Is it because audiences have been dumbed down so much that they really do not care if a film&#8217;s music leaves any kind of lasting effect? Or is it because we have passed the point of being able to truly enjoy a film for &#8220;entertainment&#8217;s sake&#8221; and we therefore do not have the capacity as humans anymore to appreciate a visual stimuli that has an aural one accompanying it?</p>
<p>When I browse <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Reporter</span></a> or read <span style="font-style: italic;"><a class="zem_slink" title="Variety (magazine)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_%28magazine%29" rel="wikipedia">Variety</a></span> and see which composers are working on which films, I see a new group of composers who are making a name for themselves as &#8220;smash-and-grab&#8221; film composers. It saddens me greatly to see poster after poster at the theater with any of these composers&#8217; names in the block because I cannot help but think that once I get my shot at a large feature, their method of churning out these awful scores is going to be the norm. Will that mean that I am going to be asked to imitate a cheap sounding score? What will that do to my value as a new guy trying to get my career out of first gear? There are many composers who are basically not hirable due to that very syndrome already!</p>
<p>In my memory, there has not been a truly hummable theme that has come out of a film score in the last five years. If you can think of one, please speak up, because I honestly cannot. My hope is that someone here, in the SCOREcast community, will be the next great writer to give us a memorable theme along the lines of Goldsmith&#8217;s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066206/"><span style="font-style: italic;">Patton</span></a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060177/"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Blue Max</span></a>, or even his later work on the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a class="zem_slink" title="Rambo (film)" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462499/" rel="imdb">Rambo</a></span> series and <a class="zem_slink" style="font-style: italic;" title="Star Trek" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek" rel="wikipedia">Star Trek</a> franchise.</p>
<p>Is there a market for thematic writing in film today, and if so, for those us who are realistically 5+ years away from entering the industry in earnest, will it still be there when we finally arrive and need it to be?</p>

I keep coming back to this time and time again, as I think Andrew really hit the nail on the head:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;I always wonder if [people] confuse their influences with their favorite composers, which are not always the same thing. I’ll put it this way, influences run more deeply and subconsciously than ‘my fave five’ composers. For instance, I love <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky" rel="wikipedia" title="Igor Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a>. And I love to say that I love Stravinsky; it’s a win-win. However, the reality is that going to see ‘Back to the Future’ when I was a kid had a much bigger impact on me musically. Let’s just say I REALLY wanted to play Johnny B. Goode as quickly as possible. In the long term, Igor has sustained me, but Marty got me on the road.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_in_Black" rel="wikipedia" title="Men in Black">Men in Black</a>&#8221; score &#8220;sustained&#8221; me, but also &#8220;got me on the road&#8221;.  I&#8217;m showing how young I am here, as most others would probably cite older films as their gateway, but I think this was the first film score I had heard that captured my imagination and showed me the possibilities of music in film.  I don&#8217;t know what it was in the score that struck a chord (pardon the pun) somewhere inside me, but it definitively still resonates the same special feeling to this day when I listen to it.  I think I was 11 when I first heard it, and I immediately got the soundtrack for my birthday &#8211; the first CD I ever had! I couldn&#8217;t put it down and just kept listening to it.  I couldn&#8217;t believe the sounds <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000384/" rel="imdb" title="Danny Elfman">Elfman</a> was creating and I was hearing.  The orchestral colours he used, the mixture of styles and sounds, the epic and whacky mood all mixed into one.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s funny is, I created a track about a year or two ago and subconsciously had written a section of music which was nearly identical to a part of the score of Men in Black &#8211; even though I hadn&#8217;t listened to the MIB score in about 10 years! I was sitting there scratching my head thinking&#8230;.&#8221;why does this sound so familiar?&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t believe that something I had heard a decade ago had influenced me so deeply, that I could subconsciously write music based on it.</p>
<p>From those first four deep notes on the cello, we know we&#8217;re in for a ride.  In my opinion, Elfman&#8217;s music for this opening sequence is close to perfection and is a prime example of excellent film scoring &#8211; every time I hear that opening sequence, I can see the dragonfly buzzing along the highway, swooping up and down, then getting splattered all over the windscreen as we see on screen.  And that in my opinion is one of a number of things, that makes excellent film music &#8211; when you hear that cue, you immediately remember what it was referring to in the film.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hCspY__CLOo/Skj3KACZBfI/AAAAAAAAACc/js4yPKd_lFk/s1600-h/sig-sanders.png" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5352799908310615538" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hCspY__CLOo/Skj3KACZBfI/AAAAAAAAACc/js4yPKd_lFk/s400/sig-sanders.png" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 136px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 136px;" /></a>Strangely enough, it was quite a while before I owned an actual score album for <i>Star Wars</i>. My parents, in a moment of thrifty but well-intentioned genius, brought home the Electric Moog Orchestra LP for my consumption instead (!). I still have that album, by the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Maybe it was a sign, because I&#8217;ve been doing exactly that same thing—i.e., faking the sound of an orchestra with my synth rig—pretty much my whole career. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been specifically hired for again and again. So I have to thank the Electric Moog Orchestra for showing me the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">…But enough on that! <i>Star Wars</i> was for me what I suspect it is for many people of a certain age: the film score to end all film scores. The inspiration to get into this crazy business. <b>The Grail</b>, as it were. Although that&#8217;s a whole other John Williams score. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">George Lucas calls the six <i>Star Wars</i> pictures an homage to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_film">serial adventure film</a>, a cinematic tradition that dates back to some of the earliest silent films (and reached its apex during the heyday of the Hollywood studio system). The scores bear that out; in fact, they&#8217;re crucial to making that connection. They are thematic, even leitmotivic. Their harmonic language is largely that of Romantic chromaticism. They are emotionally immediate and non-ironic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">So: Is this approach to film scoring even marginally relevant today? Is the contemporary audience so self-aware, so ironically detached, that this style of music has lost its ability to connect?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The curmudgeon in me wants to say that, sadly, we&#8217;ve moved on. Today&#8217;s scores are all about the pad and the Big Drummy Drummy… with a little reverb-soaked duduk on top (Protip: filmmakers love duduk! Can&#8217;t get enough of it!). Anything resembling a theme is straight-up heresy; traditional harmony is for suckers; the sound of a live orchestra is sort of hopelessly quaint. And on and on like that, until it starts to sound suspiciously like whining.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">But reports of the Death of Traditional Film Scoring are premature. Listen to any episode of <i>24 </i>for a great example. Sure, Sean Callery handles a lot of the tense dialog scenes with creepy atmospheric synth pads and the occasional low drum thud (and is extremely effective in doing so—maximum respect to Sean). But he also integrates cues that take advantage of the power of theme, and of conventional harmony, and of all the emotional connections we still feel when we hear an orchestra or simply a noble horn line (the <i>24</i> Main Title encapsulates this perfectly). He&#8217;s doing what composers have always done: integrating the old with the new, and finding ways to make it all connect with the audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Another example: Absolutely central to Michael Giacchino&#8217;s &#8220;sound&#8221; is the fact that he uses a Real Live Orchestra, recorded old-school by Dan Wallin. You can hear every bow, every articulation, because they&#8217;re <i>real</i>. Take a look at MG&#8217;s creative output over the last two years, and, besides wondering when the man sleeps, you can&#8217;t help but conclude that he&#8217;s massively relevant on quantity alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">As someone whose process often starts with themes and harmonies, I am happy and relieved to tell you: the influence of <i>Star Wars</i> is alive and well. The Force, to use the ending you must have seen coming a mile away, is still with us.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/05/sig-well.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-730" title="sig-well" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/05/sig-well.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>We all know that an increasing proportion of music produced for media can be made on our computers, using all manner of virtual instruments and tools.  Much music made this way is accepted by listeners, and for some, no doubt, even preferred.  At the other end of the spectrum, a lot of music is still created the good old-fashioned way &#8212; by flesh-and-blood musicians who play our scores.  In the middle, all sorts of hybrids are possible.</p>
<p>It would be of great interest (well, to me, at least) to know more about the <span style="font-style: italic;">actual </span>proportion of music which, in its <span style="font-style: italic;">final </span>form (e.g., in a film soundtrack) is currently being played by &#8220;virtual musicians&#8221; vs. real musicians.</p>
<p>Another facet of this issue:  Is the public&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">expectation </span>for media score shifting in the direction of virtual music?  If so, are we eroding an appreciation for the incredible accomplishments of many great composers (think Wagner, Stravinsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Copland, Holmboe, and on and on) who, without a computer, effects rack, or whatever, created music that could readily be fantastic score even in today&#8217;s films?  Does it matter?</p>
<p>Is constant pressure to produce on short schedules forcing increased use of virtual music technology?  Does this approach actually save time (or money)?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to suggest that using technology to produce music isn&#8217;t a true art in and of itself.  I&#8217;ve long been a virtual music proponent, but traditional practice is becoming of increasing interest to me.</p>
<p>Please share your impressions and actual experience.  I&#8217;d bet a <span style="font-style: italic;">lot</span> of us have something to say on this topic &#8211; and it affects how we approach our craft, as well.</p>
