Its core aim is to inform and educate the film community on the re-sophistication of the business and craft of making music for all visual media applications.<\/p>\n<h2>SCOREcast Origins<\/h2>\n<p>Film composer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.deaneogden.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Deane Ogden<\/a> (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm1676420\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">IMDb<\/a>) founded <strong><em>SCOREcast<\/em><\/strong> in the fall of 2006, which started as a monthly Internet podcast called the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/category\/podcast\/\" target=\"_blank\">SCOREcast Podcast Show<\/a>. The podcast show was aimed at helping those trying to get a foot in the door of the film music business. Originally hosted by Deane and his studio team, each episode would offer practical business advice, tips and techniques based on Deane&#8217;s personal experience as an independent feature film and television composer.<\/p>\n<h2>iTunes and Academia<\/h2>\n<p>As the show began to evolve, so did its audience. After early integration into the iTunes family of podcasts the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/category\/podcast\/\" target=\"_blank\">SCOREcast Podcast Show<\/a>\u00a0rapidly became one of the most listened-to film music-centric podcasts on the Internet. In August of 2007, after back-to-back turns on iTunes\u2019 Featured Top 20 list, two of America&#8217;s top universities incorporated the SCOREcast Podcast Show into the \u201crecommended resources\u201d for their film music certification program curricula. By January 2008, the SCOREcast listener base on iTunes reached upwards of 6,000 people worldwide.\u00a0With the sudden new audience of thousands of would-be composers, Ogden enlisted the help of veteran film and television composer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sandersmusic.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lee Sanders<\/a> (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm0761631\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">IMDb<\/a>) to co-host the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/category\/podcast\/\" target=\"_blank\">SCOREcast Podcast Show<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>SCOREcastOnline.com Website<\/h2>\n<p><strong><\/strong>Soon after, Ogden formed a global leadership team made-up of working film music professionals and began outlining plans for a SCOREcast website. The site would serve a three-fold purpose: To serve as as a \u201cvirtual lounge&#8221; for unknown composers interested in a career in film music, to support the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/category\/podcast\/\" target=\"_blank\">SCOREcast Podcast Show<\/a>\u00a0with shownotes and a searchable database of articles, and to fill the need for a centralized resource for working professionals within the film, television, and video game music industries.<\/p>\n<p>In April of 2009, on the eve of the 19th episode of the podcast, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">SCOREcastOnline.com<\/a>\u00a0was launched, servicing the entire film music community, and featuring regular columns, video, audio, blogs, polls, and interactive commenting. As the roll-out of the website continued throughout 2009, so did the expansion of its content and features. A worldwide team of contributing editors was assembled, consisting of working professional television and film composers, orchestrators, music editors, re-recording mixers, film music recordists and composer assistants.<\/p>\n<p>On December 12, 2010, Los Angeles-based composer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brianralston.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Brian Ralston<\/a> (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm1335434\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">IMDb<\/a>) replaced Sanders as Ogden&#8217;s co-host on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/category\/podcast\/\" target=\"_blank\">SCOREcast Podcast Show<\/a>\u00a0and the 27th episode of the podcast was released.<\/p>\n<h2>Community Chapters<\/h2>\n<p><strong><\/strong>SCOREcast&#8217;s first local community chapter, <a title=\"SCOREcast: Hollywood\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/sco.socal\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>SCOREcast: Hollywood<\/em><\/strong><\/a>, was launched at the 2008 NAMM Show.
