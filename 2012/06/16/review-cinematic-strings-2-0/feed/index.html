					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the terrific review Tobias. This library has been high on my &quot;must buy&quot; list for some time and this review has confirmed my thinking based on my own research.


As you say it doesn&#039;t have everything, but as a general purpose strings workhorse it seems hard to beat and I always have EWQLSO to fall back on for things like harmonics and Bartok pizz.


Thanks again. :)

P.S. I&#039;m hoping that a soundset for Sibelius turns up soon for this too, I am aware that one is in the works.]]></description>
