				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center">Part 3:  MIDI Composing</p>
<p>Okay, so we’ve covered the basic features of <b><i>Studio One</i></b>, and we know how to make a scoring template for composing.</p>
<p>Now it is time to show you the actual MIDI options and workflow of Studio One for composers.<br />
Before I start, I want to say one thing: Studio One is not designed for film composers, so its MIDI features lack the power of Logic or Digital Performer, because it is a relatively young DAW (Version 2.5).  But, I am pretty confident that Studio One 3 will bring on the “heavy weapons”.</p>
<p>Having said that, let’s get this thing started.</p>
<p><b>MIDI tracks</b> in Studio One are called <b><i>Instrument Tracks</i></b>. You add an Instrument track by <b><i>right clicking</i></b> in the <b><i>light gray area</i></b> to the left of the <b><i>project window</i></b>, and click the <i>Instrument Track</i> option in the drop menu.</p>
<p><a href="../../../2013/01/31/scoring-in-presonus-studio-one-midi-workflow/add-instrument-track" rel="attachment wp-att-1968"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1968" alt="Add Instrument Track" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Add-Instrument-Track-640x337.jpg" width="565" height="297" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Add-Instrument-Track-640x337.jpg 640w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Add-Instrument-Track-389x205.jpg 389w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px" /></a>If you want to add multiple Instrument Tracks, you <i>right click</i> again in the <i>light gray area</i>, and select the first option called <b><i>Add Tracks</i></b>. You can also use the default shortcut for this (T). Once you choose that, a window will open showing you different options of tracks and setups you wish to add. You can add the names of those tracks, the number of tracks you wish to add, types of tracks (in this case its instrument Tracks), color of the tracks, input of the tracks (you can instantly choose which MIDI controller you wish do use), and output of the tracks. Output is an actual MIDI instrument you wish to use with the Instrument Tracks (i.e. Kontakt). Once you’ve made your choice, click <b><i>OK</i></b>, and you’re good to go.<br />
<a href="../../../2013/01/31/scoring-in-presonus-studio-one-midi-workflow/multiple-tracks" rel="attachment wp-att-1969"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1969" alt="Multiple Tracks" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Multiple-Tracks-640x339.jpg" width="565" height="299" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Multiple-Tracks-640x339.jpg 640w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Multiple-Tracks-389x206.jpg 389w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px" /></a>The principle of MIDI recording and editing is pretty much similar as in every other DAW out there. You record a track, double click on it, and a <b><i>piano roll</i></b> will open (F2 is the shortcut). You can edit almost everything in piano roll. All of the familiar tools are there: <b><i>point tool, split tool, paint tool (which has multiple options for writing), mute tool and listen tool</i></b>. Paint Tool kind of resembles of Photoshop paint tool, giving you options of writing freehand, sine wave, line, parabola, square wave etc.<br />
<a href="../../../2013/01/31/scoring-in-presonus-studio-one-midi-workflow/piano-roll" rel="attachment wp-att-1970"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1970" alt="Piano Roll" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Piano-Roll-640x346.jpg" width="565" height="305" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Piano-Roll-640x346.jpg 640w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Piano-Roll-389x210.jpg 389w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px" /></a></p>
<p>There is also a dedicated Quantize tool with a lot of options (these are called actions in Studio One).<br />
<a href="../../../2013/01/31/scoring-in-presonus-studio-one-midi-workflow/quantize-tool" rel="attachment wp-att-1971"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1971" alt="Quantize Tool" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Quantize-Tool-640x263.jpg" width="565" height="232" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Quantize-Tool-640x263.jpg 640w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Quantize-Tool-389x160.jpg 389w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Quantize-Tool.jpg 1286w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px" /></a></p>
<p>I won’t go deep into the options, but one interesting thing is adding humanization to MIDI notes. Even though the MIDI clip is quantized, adding humanization will change the velocities of the notes and nudge quantization a bit.</p>
<p>All of the options and actions can be added and edited with the pain tool.<br />
Modulation can be hand drawn if you don’t have a keyboard with mod wheel.<br />
<a href="../../../2013/01/31/scoring-in-presonus-studio-one-midi-workflow/modulation" rel="attachment wp-att-1972"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1972" alt="Modulation" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Modulation-640x37.jpg" width="565" height="32" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Modulation-640x37.jpg 640w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Modulation-389x22.jpg 389w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px" /></a></p>
<p>Same thing goes for velocity, pitch, and you can add other parameters that you would like to use on the MIDI track.</p>
<p>You add them by <b><i>left clicking on the three dot tab</i></b>, on the left of velocity tab.<br />
Once you click there, a new window will open, showing you all of the MIDI parameters you can add to the track. It’s as simple as choosing an option and clicking on <b><i>Add button</i></b>.<br />
<a href="../../../2013/01/31/scoring-in-presonus-studio-one-midi-workflow/parameters" rel="attachment wp-att-1973"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1973" alt="Parameters" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Parameters-640x346.jpg" width="565" height="305" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Parameters-640x346.jpg 640w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Parameters-389x210.jpg 389w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px" /></a>You can also pick a <b><i>scale</i></b> to use for writing. On the left side of the piano roll, there is an option for choosing a scale. Just click on the <b><i>Root</i></b> of the scale to choose, and on the <b><i>snap value</i></b> to pick the type of scale you would like.<br />
<a href="../../../2013/01/31/scoring-in-presonus-studio-one-midi-workflow/scale" rel="attachment wp-att-1974"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1974" alt="Scale" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Scale.jpg" width="156" height="222" /></a></p>
<p>There is one more cool option that Studio One has. Right clicking on the MIDI track in the project window, shows you all of the MIDI options that you can use on the track. I like especially the velocity and humanize options. Velocity option can come in handy.  For example, your note velocities are set like you wanted them, and you have copied a couple of same parts of the MIDI clip. You would like the next clip to play a bit louder than the previous one, but your note velocities are going up until 127. You right click on the clip, and change the velocity percentage of the clip a bit up, so it plays louder than the previous part. Or for example, the instrument is programmed to play different samples on different velocities, so you can use this option to change the velocity of the desired note that triggers the sample. The way I wrote it, sounds a bit confusing, but you’ll get the picture. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
<a href="../../../2013/01/31/scoring-in-presonus-studio-one-midi-workflow/right-click-options" rel="attachment wp-att-1975"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1975" alt="Right Click options" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Right-Click-options.jpg" width="605" height="520" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Right-Click-options.jpg 605w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Right-Click-options-389x334.jpg 389w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" /></a></p>
<p>And that is pretty much it…</p>
<p>I hope these few posts are, and will be, of help to you in your future exploration of PreSonus Studio One.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[New to Apple's Logic? Apple certified Logic expert Yaiza Varona takes you through the essential steps to getting started with it for the first time. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>First things first: How to open Logic</h2>
<p>Have you ever thought of how Logic opens, and is it the most convenient way for you?<strong><strong> </strong></strong>By default, Logic will always open the last project you were working on. This could not be too convenient if you wished to work on something else now, and the previous project takes ages in loading lots of samples just for you to close it and open something else right after!</p>
<p>In <strong><em>Preferences/General/Startup</em></strong>, you can choose “do nothing”, or “ask”, “create a new project from template”&#8230;choosing the one you use most will save you lots of time, since repeating the same steps over and over not only consumes your time but also your creative energy.</p>
<p>Setting up Logic before using it will save much time for you. Through this series of articles we will customize your opening setup for a faster workflow depending on the project (we&#8217;ll speak of templates in later articles).</p>
<h5>Preferences vs. Settings</h5>
<p>Now, a small reminder about the differences between Preferences and Settings (seems obvious after a while but it&#8217;s worth mentioning at least once).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>Preferences</em></strong> apply to Logic&#8217;s main setup, and affect all projects. In the preferences tab you can configure options such as Logic’s startup action, key commands, control surfaces, bit depth, etc. Any changes you make here will affect all your Logic projects.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">On the other hand, <strong><em>Settings</em></strong> only affect the specific setup of the current project, and can be set individually for each project. You may want to edit the metronome with a higher pitch because you struggle to listen to it in your current busy mix and this won&#8217;t affect the usual sound of it in other projects; you can also edit locally the score edition parameters and general parameters concerning video when scoring to picture.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Row, Row, Row Your DAW: Navigating Your Project</h3>
<p>Navigating through the project is what we do most of the time. Since it is one of our most common actions, it is in our advantage to learn how to do it in the fastest way possible.</p>
<p>As a general rule, clicking here and there with the mouse will not be the quickest way to achieve an action. Fortunately, there are many alternatives! Let’s explore some :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use TAB to toggle between different areas.</strong> (Areas refer to the different ‘sections’ of a Logic project, i.e. Arrange Window, Piano Roll, Events List, etc.) By selecting an area, you give it key focus (and it is highlighted by a white frame). This means that whatever keys you press will affect this area. For example, let’s say you want to ‘select all’ in your Piano roll window. If you press [Cmd+A] without first giving the piano roll window key focus, Logic WILL select all but in whichever area has key focus at the time!</li>
<li><strong><em>Shortcut Keys</em>: </strong>Some areas and features that you use very often can be accessed in Logic by simply pressing a key. Of course they can also be accessed by clicking on them, but after a while that movement of the mouse will consume part of your precious time. You can become more efficient by using, for example:</li>
<ul>
<li>[Z] to zoom in and out</li>
<li>[A] for Automation</li>
<li>[G] for Global Tracks</li>
<li>[P] for Piano Roller</li>
<li>[I] for Inspector</li>
<li>[W] for Wave Editor</li>
<li>[N] for Score – <em>what?</em> (Yes, Logic used to be called “Notator”)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4><em>See You in the Bar (The Transport Bar)</em></h4>
<p>This wonderful bar where all composers spend much of their day can be customized by right-clicking on it and choosing “customize transport bar”. There you can add or remove features according to your frequency of use (or mood of the day, or to suit the clothes you&#8217;re wearing).</p>
<p>Are you going to record very fast passages and you don&#8217;t happen to be a pianist? You could add Varispeed so when these difficult passages appear you can slow the performance as you need for your recording and be back to normal with just a click. Too comfortable with your performance skills to feel you need a click? You can remove it from the transport bar altogether!</p>
<p>Now, once you have the transport bar of your dreams, there are also ways of speeding up its use, other than clicking on it with the mouse, for example using:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Space Bar] to Play / Stop</li>
<li>FW / RW a bar by using [“,”]  or [left arrow] and [“.”] or [right arrow]  (depends on your keyboard, but they are defined in <em><strong>Preferences / Key Commands</strong></em>)</li>
<li>The previous plus [SHIFT] makes the playhead jump 8 bars before or after the current position (8 bars is a very common segment in 4/4 pop arrangements, hence the length of the jump)</li>
<li>[R] to record</li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h3>To Save or Not to Save? That Is the Question</h3>
<p>Saving your project once in a while is a good safety measure. However, every time you do it, Logic keeps a safety backup of your project in your project folder and after a determined number of copies, it begins erasing the oldest. This means that if, for example, you changed your mind about the direction of the writing and you want to go back to what you were doing a couple of hours before, you can find that you already wrote over the saved file! Let’s say it works like a little version of Time Machine in that respect, only that the space available is much smaller. The number of backups Logic keeps is 10 by default and can be edited up to 100 in <em><strong>Preferences / General / Project Handling</strong></em>. However, bear in mind that increasing the number of backups will eat up your resources!</p>
<p>So, depending on how much you feel you are experimenting in your project you might want to save your changes more or less often. If you are working pretty much straight forward it would be wise to save as soon as you&#8217;re happy with what you have done. Bear in mind that Logic tries to keep an updated version of the project in case of crashing (you can find it in the same project folder) but it&#8217;s far from being perfect and in case anything happened ask yourself how much work done can you risk to lose?</p>
<p>So, if you have decided you want to save your project, what is the quickest way to do it?</p>
<p>Once again, the quickest way of saving your project is using a keyboard command: [Cmd + S]. You can of course go with the mouse to <em><strong>File / Save</strong></em>, but that is going to spend precious instants, especially if you tend to save your project quite often.</p>
<p>By the way, you will know if your project is saved or has been modified by observing the project icon next to the project name: if the icon appears dimmed, then there have been changes since the last saved version (this could include just opening the project again).</p>
<h4></h4>
<h3>Ok&#8230;.I Got Lost in My Project&#8230; Need Help!</h3>
<p>The magic words: <em>undo</em> and <em>redo</em>. You can very easily undo many of your steps in Logic (be careful — you can&#8217;t undo the dragging of a fader in the mix, for example) by using the keyboard command [Cmd+Z]. Did you decide it was a right step in the end? You can redo by adding [SHIFT] to the previous combination. If you´re not sure on how many steps you wish to undo or redo, you can find the Undo History in the Arrange menu, <strong><em>Edit/ Undo History</em></strong>. Again, you can edit the number of steps kept in the Undo History in <em><strong>Preferences / General / Editing</strong></em>, with the same criterion explained for the project backups.</p>
<p>Now, a very common scenario: you&#8217;ve left your workplace for an instant in pursuit of coffee, and when you come back you find out your cat has decided to jump all over your keyboard and add its own style to your track – ok it could also happen that you at some point lost track of what you were doing in the project but we&#8217;ll still buy the cat excuse – panic! Thankfully, there is a wonderful feature that allows us to go back in time to the last saved version: Revert to Saved (<em><strong>File / Revert to Saved</strong></em>). Bear in mind that every time you use this feature it will load your project again, so if you&#8217;re handling a project that takes five minutes to load, that&#8217;s the time it will take to re-open the project.</p>
<p><em>For those of you starting out with Logic as  your main DAW or as a supplement to another program, I hope this was useful for you. Let me know your thoughts in the COMMENTS below, and if you have any other tips or tricks for setting up Logic, leave those as well. We&#8217;ll dive into more behind this powerful program very soon!</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my last column, I wrote about <em><a href="../../../2010/08/les-brockmann-casting-your-score.html" target="_blank">casting your score</a></em> — choosing the professional musicians in your team, the men and women, instrumentalists or singers, who will give your musical ideas the best possible voice. Nothing will give your music heart, soul, the real human touch, better than the sounds of skilled musicians. Even if you yourself are the finest, with years of experience, even adding just one pro player will double your firepower, and even casual listeners will notice.</p>
<p>So, now that you are off the phone and someone is on his or her way, it&#8217;s time to think about just how to interact for the best possible results. This is where you will be called on to put on your &#8220;producer&#8221; hat. Let&#8217;s talk about what that entails.</p>
<h2>Producers In Different Music Types</h2>
<p>Most of us are aware of the job of producer, or at least that most professional music projects require one. In the case of pop album artists, the producer is often someone different than the artist, a specialist who may have many years of experience and credits with a variety of performers. As the overall guide and leader of a project, the producer starts at the beginning with an artist with some sort of raw talent, and sees the recording project all the way to the successful delivery of a finished master recording. Along the way, he or she is called to be a scheduler, accountant, arranger, songwriter or writing partner, guide to the technical details of the studio process, psychologist and counselor, negotiator, liaison with the client (record company, etc.) supervisor of the artists and musicians who may perform, player/programmer, overseer of mixing, and (hopefully) all-round highly skilled musician with the ability and experience to see the project through to its completed stage.</p>
<p>Like I said, in the record industry, that person is often a hired specialist, separate from the artist. In the score music business, that person is generally &#8230; YOU, the composer.</p>
<p>What are some of the issues you&#8217;ll need to keep your eyes and ears on as a guest musician performs on your score? Some examples:</p>
<h4>Being Prepared</h4>
<p><strong></strong>Obviously you&#8217;ll start with some idea of how long you want the musician to work, and how many cues you want played. (This has a lot to do with budget, of course.) In order to make the best use of time, you want to make sure that you have well-copied, legible music written out. Even if you intend to record an improvised part, a simple chart with bar numbers, sections indicated, and chord changes, will help everybody navigate. If you&#8217;re not sure about your copyist skills, it&#8217;s worth asking a friend to help or at least proofread. One of the most unnecessary and disastrous time wasters is for a musician to try to make sense out of a part that is illegible, poorly formatted, or contains mistakes.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t just assume that, since your sequencing program has a notation printing function, that it will automatically come out good enough. I have yet to see software automatically format the chart in the best professional way; some hands-on manipulating always makes it better. If you&#8217;re not sure what real professional copying is supposed to look like, that&#8217;s a topic that might be worth looking for at a local school of music. Just because copying now is almost always done with software rather than pen and ink, doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s an obsolete skill — formatting and layout make a big difference. Or, like I said, get some help.</p>
<h4>How Long Will It Take?</h4>
<p><strong></strong>Once your musicians are on the clock, you&#8217;ll want to make the most efficient use of time possible. Ahead of time, you might want to plan out how many minutes of music, or how many cues, you would like to get accomplished each hour. For orchestral recording, the music union has guidelines of how many minutes of music should be recorded per hour, so that at least gives a general notion to start with. It takes some experience to learn to set realistic goals with this sort of thing, so how do you get started? Just dive in, and take meticulous notes, and you&#8217;ll learn. If things are moving more quickly than you expect, then great; if they&#8217;re going slower than you hoped, try to figure out why. Are the charts playable? Are they neatly copied? Are they in the comfortable range of the instrument? And is this particular player capable of doing what you were hoping? Figuring out how to assess all these factors is part of the learning process.</p>
<p>Take notes and keep records! One producer/composer I work with has over 30 years experience in recording the best players and singers, but to this day he still carefully writes down in a database exactly what happened and how long it took with each musician&#8217;s name and with each project. There&#8217;s no way everything can always be perfectly predictable, but the more you do it, the better you&#8217;ll have a sense of what to expect, and as your knowledge increases you&#8217;ll be able to confidently tackle bigger projects.</p>
<h2>Judging Performance Quality: When Is It Good Enough?</h2>
<p><strong></strong>From my chair as engineer, over the years I&#8217;ve observed a lot of producers, and made my own (private) judgments. I&#8217;ve seen some be simply too picky, redoing little things when it was already good enough, which can drain the energy and enthusiasm out of musicians. Others (perhaps a bit intimidated by the process) might leave things a little more sloppy than necessary. It&#8217;s okay to ask for a retake if you think it can or must be a better performance. Often a savvy and helpful musician will say &#8220;I think I can do that better; how about saving that and then giving me another chance?&#8221; And especially with improvising, you might want to save more than one choice, and pick or comp later. Today with digital recording, there are basically infinite numbers of tracks. But (maybe from my past experience with analog tape) I never think it&#8217;s worthwhile to save garbage. Judge as you go along; why wait to sort through tons of stuff later?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget, there such a thing as musician fatigue. Both the chops and the brain get tired, and it&#8217;s standard practice to give a 10-minute break each hour. And at some point every musician will be &#8220;cooked&#8221; for the day. Especially with a passage that might be difficult, even the finest musician might say, &#8220;I have one or two of these in me; make sure you get it recorded well!&#8221; Never embarrass yourself by having to admit that the perfect take was distorted or you forgot to hit &#8220;save&#8221;. (Too much to think about to produce and also mind the technicalities of recording? Let me tell you about a full-time highly skilled professional specialist called a Recording Engineer&#8230;)</p>
<h2>Singers and Vocals</h2>
<p><strong></strong>Although it&#8217;s somewhat less likely for a composer to use a singer on a score than in other types of music, it&#8217;s often done, and worthy of special mention. There&#8217;s something very intimate about the act of singing into a microphone. It seems especially emotional, and singers wear their hearts on their sleeves. It really takes a bit of a psychologist to get the best performance out of anybody, but especially a singer. Don&#8217;t forget, one of the most important things you can do is dish out praise, even when you&#8217;re not quite sure it&#8217;s deserved. You don&#8217;t want to come across like a phony-baloney, but you do want to convince performers that you&#8217;re there for them, and create an environment where they will feel safe doing their best and giving their all.</p>
<p>Even singers who read well (and not all do) have an element of improvising in expressive performance. Don&#8217;t be so hung up on your previously imagined ideas, or the way you would sing it if you could, that you fail to recognize something unexpected that might be great. One time I was there (keeping my mouth shut) while one of the most powerful producers in the business, a name you&#8217;d recognize immediately, reduced a fine singer to tears by rejecting everything he did, and instead singing his own version into the talkback mic over and over. Even though that man has written some of the best pop songs ever, I lost respect for him, because of his poor people skills in that situation. Keep your ears wide open, and don&#8217;t forget that one of the reasons you&#8217;ve hired great musicians or singers is to collaborate with them, and to get their best ideas for your music.</p>
<h2>Cutting Your Losses / Heroic Saves</h2>
<p><strong></strong>Okay, sometimes it&#8217;s just not happening. I once watched a composer valiantly trying to get the right kind of loping easy country feel on a fiddle melody. One after another, several players took a stab at it, were politely thanked (and paid), and then, after they left, I was told to erase their parts while he frantically phoned the next one. If this happens, yes, you&#8217;ll take a bit of a bath, but you&#8217;ll also learn something, and it won&#8217;t be your last time ever producing a soloist or having money to spend.</p>
<p>Of course we&#8217;ve got a lot of tools in our computers these days that can help turn a marginal performance into an acceptable one, and maybe even a great one. As a matter of principle, I hate Autotune, but it&#8217;s a devil we all live with these days, put to use cleaning up performances both ordinary and even superlative. For example, a good studio singer can usually get a track in two or three passes — the first is for reading and learning, and then the emotion kicks in and you better have the machine in record. Then if you say, “That&#8217;s great but the last two notes were flat”, then they start thinking too much and lose the spark. Better to just tune it up a bit. (Yes, I&#8217;ve gone over to the dark side, with the rest of you!)</p>
<p>Likewise, digital editing and even quantizing of rhythmic parts are possible in almost all the major software packages. But, if you&#8217;re on a deadline, hopefully you won&#8217;t have to spend all night cleaning a part that should have been done right to start with!</p>
<h2>How To Learn</h2>
<p><strong></strong>One of the best ways to get an idea of what it&#8217;s like to work with studio musicians, either in a studio or home setting, is to get a chance to watch someone else do it. This is where it comes in handy to be in touch with other working composers — ask around and see if someone will let you be a &#8220;fly on the wall&#8221; in one of their sessions. Or, better yet, find some way to help: set up person, copyist, make tea, etc.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in the Los Angeles area, a good organization that offers some of these kinds of observing and mentoring experiences is the <a href="http://www.thescl.com/" target="_blank">Society of Composers and Lyricists</a>. Their &#8220;<a href="http://thescl.com/mentor_program" target="_blank">Mentor Program</a>&#8221; offers young composers a chance to sit in on sessions with working composers, observe, and ask questions.</p>
<p>By fortunate coincidence, the annual meeting of the SCL is coming up very soon, Wednesday evening October 6, 2010, in Hollywood. See the website for more details. For those attending, the price of admission will be credited towards annual dues if you sign up, and there is a discount rate for students. And you’re likely to meet at least one <em>SCOREcaster</em> there. Don&#8217;t miss it!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[How to assemble the perfect “cast” of musicians to enhance your score.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I attended the first annual (or bi-annual? More soon, I hope!) SCOREcast Online mixer and picnic at a beautiful home here in LA, and I sure enjoyed meeting and getting a chance to talk with a number of terrific folks. I got into an interesting conversation with some composers about the whole concept of &#8220;casting&#8221; musicians and &#8220;producing&#8221; their playing as they contribute to your score. Just as a film, television show, or play has a cast of actors to tell the story, so does the score, and the group of musicians you select can have a big impact on how your score comes out. This will be about assembling the perfect &#8220;cast&#8221; of musicians to enhance your score; in a subsequent article, I will write about the production process.</p>
<p>You may be aware that I am a strong advocate and fan of all the fantastic professional musicians, instrumentalists and singers that I&#8217;m fortunate to work with. Here in Southern California there really is a wealth of the &#8220;best of the best&#8221;, on all kinds of instruments, in all kinds of styles. If you are working on a score and can&#8217;t find a way to get at least one guest &#8220;pro&#8221; musician to record on it, then you&#8217;re missing out on a big chance to make something better than you could ever do on your own, no matter who you are. Two heads really are better than one. Or how about three? Four? A dozen?</p>
<p>No matter where you are or how far along in your career you might be, one of the most important tools you can develop is your own personal contact list of musicians. Let&#8217;s get started by figuring out what you&#8217;re going to require for a particular project. Which instrument(s) do you need? Are good music reading skills important to you? Certainly, a good reader can help move things quickly in the studio, and there are always deadlines. On the other hand, every once in a while I encounter a musician who doesn&#8217;t read well, but brings such a compelling personality to their playing that they deserve a place at the mic. (I must admit I&#8217;m biased towards good readers, and I know players who can read absolute &#8220;fly s**t” in tempo, on click, and make it sing.)</p>
<p>(If you, as a composer, are insecure about writing for orchestral instruments, but are serious about growing in your profession, there are college or adult-school classes in many communities that will help brush up your skills. In LA take a look at UCLA Extension, where I taught for a dozen years. The instructors there are working pros who know how it&#8217;s done in the real world.)</p>
<p>What about improvising? That depends on your style of music. In some cases improvisation is completely irrelevant, and in others it can absolutely make your score a success. I remember when I first worked with score composers; we&#8217;d record a musician, and the composer would say something like, &#8220;Just play the blues here.&#8221; I’d think, &#8220;Wait a minute, doesn&#8217;t that make the musician the composer or co-composer?&#8221; But I learned that&#8217;s absolutely accepted, and there are so many musicians with good improvisational skills who are more than happy to make that contribution to a score.</p>
<p>The well-known composer Thomas Newman, when speaking about his scores for feature films, never hesitates to mention the contributions of his team of improvising musicians, which are some of the best in the world. Does that mean they compose the score for him? Of course not; he provides the structure, guidance, and decisions about timing, melody, and mood, and he &#8220;produces&#8221; the performances (more about that to come). His unmistakable stamp is all over every score he does, no matter how much improvisation is involved. (On the occasion that a musician does substantially compose or co-compose, though, he&#8217;s generous to give credit.)</p>
<p>We got into a discussion at the SCO picnic about string players, as one woman there had a background as a concert and orchestral violinist. It&#8217;s interesting to me, the difference between a &#8220;violinist&#8221; and a &#8220;fiddle player&#8221;, both equally respectable. There are certainly situations in score music where you would want one or the other, but it would be a big mistake to get the wrong one! In LA there are violinists with technique rivaling that of Perlman or Heifetz, but who couldn&#8217;t play &#8220;Row, Row, Row Your Boat&#8221; if it wasn&#8217;t written out. I think of a fiddle player more as someone who can improvise and play by ear, be it rock, jazz, or country style. The rarest are those few who can do it all: read well, play with confidence when the red light goes on, and improvise in an interesting way. When you hear an improvising violinist on major film and television scores, the list of persons who that might be is probably smaller than the number of fingers on your right hand.</p>
<p>Of course, as you work with various musicians you&#8217;ll find out about their personalities and job skills. Do they show up on time with a positive attitude, ready to give 100% effort? Just like a cross-section of any profession, there are a few who don&#8217;t, but I find that they are rarely invited back for a second chance.</p>
<p>One group of musicians I&#8217;d like to give special mention to is those in the older age range. Some time ago, as a young engineer working for an equally young composer, I was interested to see he often brought in players who might be thought of as senior citizens. I quickly found out that these are some of the best musicians available, and they brought a level of wisdom and experience that were great assets to the music and the composer. They never came across as big-shots or felt they were too good to be there, and the composer was smart to rely on their lifetime of experience. The respect flowed in both directions.</p>
<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; the question was asked at the SCO hang, &#8220;how do I get someone like that to want to record on my little score?&#8221; The answer: it never hurts to ask! Even the most skilled players aren&#8217;t busy all the time, and many think it&#8217;s important to encourage up-and-coming composers and nurture talented folks who will go on to bigger and better things. Even though it&#8217;s appropriate to offer a respectful amount of money, they don&#8217;t always cost an arm and a leg.</p>
<p>Many composers use the same musicians on every project they do, and their sound becomes an integral part of the composer’s sound. Composers I work with often have their &#8220;team&#8221; that they couldn&#8217;t get along without. When your music gets noticed and your career blossoms, in part because of the contributions of terrific musicians, don&#8217;t forget to give them credit and your gratitude (and repeat business).</p>
<p>How do you find the right musicians for you? That&#8217;s one of the nice things about participating in SCOREcast Online, as well as organizations like the <a href="http://thescl.com/home">Society of Composers and Lyricists</a> and other professional groups. Ask around, particularly toward folks with a bit more experience in the score business, and you&#8217;re sure to find a wealth of recommendations.</p>
<p>What if you&#8217;re not in a city where there are good recording musicians available? These days, the Internet is breaking down the barriers of distance. You can get players from all over the world to play for you using digital file transfers. Many players (in this area, at least) have personal studios set up and ready to record and deliver music on request, remotely (mixers, too!).</p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s time to start working on your &#8220;cast list&#8221;, talent on whom you will rely as you move forward in your career. There&#8217;s a feast of wonderful possibilities.</p>
<p>In a coming article, I will write about the production process and how to skillfully manage the talents of those great musicians (and yourself, as well) to get the best possible results for your scores.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you ever wonder &#8220;why&#8221; a piece of music works in a scene? Does it just bug the ever-loving crap out you, like it does me, when you play your hard work for your director only to have him or her look at you blankly and utter the words &#8220;That just doesn&#8217;t work for me&#8221;?</p>
<p>I hate hearing those words come out of my director&#8217;s mouth. I want him or her to be pleased on first listen. Of course, it doesn&#8217;t always work that way and it is our job as the composer to find out why it doesn&#8217;t work that way. Music is so subjective and so personal that I often wonder privately things I&#8217;d never share with anyone, like &#8220;Who beat the hell out of this director so bad as a child to make him not like this cue for this scene?&#8221;</p>
<p>I have traversed far and wide to search out all possible answers to the question as to why, if you line five directors up against a wall and ask them to watch a scene with music, will you get five differing answers from each. This, of course, is an unanswerable question&#8230; perhaps answered only by discovering why *you* hear music the way you hear it and particularly why certain music, to your ears, would never fit in a certain scene.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all sat and listened to film scores independent of film to hear what others are doing or to study the greats and learn from them. The problem with that — and arguably, the problem with the concept of &#8220;film music critics&#8221; — is that the purpose and function of a piece of film music is essentially null and void when divorced from picture. With that rational, the very act of listening to a piece of film detached from the picture from whence it came is only half the story. It might be a nice listening experience, but you are still only getting part of the intended result.</p>
<p>I once dated a <a class="zem_slink" title="Costume designer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costume_designer" rel="wikipedia">costume designer</a>. Our lives were a whirlwind of film events, one after the other, hers then mine then hers then mine. Finally after awhile, our professional paths inevitably crossed and I was asked to score a film where she was also the principle wardrobe supervisor during production. It was an interesting experience seeing her styling and coloring choices explode onscreen while my music passed by in the underscore.</p>
<p>As creatives, costume designers and composers have similar workflows. When I am working on menial administrative tasks like cutting demos, returning emails, or prepping my assistant&#8217;s schedule for the next week, I listen to film scores via my iTunes library. But she preferred to watch DVDs with the volume turned <em>off</em>. I always found this incredibly interesting. Seems weird, until you remember that costume designers aren&#8217;t listening for score, FX, or dialog&#8230; they&#8217;re looking at <em>costumes</em>.</p>
<p>Over time, I&#8217;ve adopted many methods of looking at film from different people in other fields than mine, incorporating many of their routines into my way of working as a composer. What has resulted is a mash-up of looking at film and music in an effort to better understand why it is that music works why it is that sometimes it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Here is what it looks like: From time to time — and *only* with time to burn, mind you — I&#8217;ll put on an old movie or a recent release and turn the sound completely <em>off</em>. Then I&#8217;ll launch my iTunes library and set the filter controls so that only MY music shows up in the browser. As the film plays, I&#8217;ll &#8220;temp&#8221; my music into the film by simply pushing &#8220;PLAY&#8221; when a scene comes up that I feel needs music. I&#8217;ll experiment — I&#8217;ll put things in that I think would fit well, or put things in that are completely from another genre just to see what works and what&#8230; um&#8230; doesn&#8217;t. (Imagine &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" title="Seven (film)" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt114369/" rel="imdb">SE7EN</a>&#8221; with tunes from that <em>sports comedy</em> you just finished!)</p>
<p>This process teaches me a TON. Not only do I learn what not to do, but I have also learned that in film music, and filmmaking in general, there are *no* rules. Everything is on the table. Therefore, sometimes, a serious scene works better with a comedic score or a slightly quirkier feel to the music. Conversely, we&#8217;ve all seen many great film composer legends play against comedy with a serious tone in the accompanying score.</p>
<p>Playing around with these kinds of things really enables you to learn &#8220;privately&#8221; and make mistakes on your own dime that canand should NEVER be made on your director&#8217;s.</p>
<p>This is one small, and maybe silly, way to &#8220;think&#8221; about how film music works and how it won&#8217;t&#8230; but it <em>&#8220;works for me&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p>What works for you?</p>
