		<description><![CDATA["I'm just gettin' warmed up." — Col. Frank Slade]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since I put the first SCOREcast podcast up on the air. Since then, an ever-evolving group of film music creatives has steered the very idea of <a href="http://scorecastonline.com">SCOREcast</a> via a process of trial-and-error and with a blind, white-knuckle, &#8220;why the hell not?&#8221; attitude. None of that would have been possible without the steadfast commitment of our amazing community—the SCOREcast Army—as well as the incredible team of contributing writers, guests, podcast hosts, and editors that have had a hand in the creation of the SCOREcast entity. The people who have made SCOREcast what it is today include composers, engineers, orchestrators, educators, copyists, music editors, assistants, contractors, and conductors.</p>
<p>As we move into yet another incarnation of the website, the podcast, and the new horizons of community-building across the film music universe, I am excited for the future of SCOREcast and I want to tell you personally how grateful I am for the part that you have played in our success. We are excited to bring even more awareness, information, opinion, editorial, review, and debate to the already incredibly diverse SCOREcast audience in this fifth year.</p>
<h2>SCOREcastOnline.com</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve redesigned the website—the third version since its launch in July of 2009. The new site will push to the web today, in conjunction with our anniversary festivities (watch the site for details on all that&#8217;s happening this month for our anniversary!). I believe the new design brings with it several key features that are going to revolutionize much of the way our film music community interacts with one another. Forums (in beta now&#8230; with much input and guidance from all of you), multi-author collaboration, videocasts, product reviews, and reader-submitted content are only a few of the new features that we are implementing for this re-launch.</p>
<h3><em>Channel Content</em></h3>
<p><strong><em></em></strong>We have divided the site up into &#8220;channels&#8221;: Business, Technology, Community, Workflow, and Composition. Each channel has a <em>senior editor</em>, with a cadre of contributing authors working with that person to bring the most up-to-date and relevant content to the forefront on each channel. More on this in a second&#8230;</p>
<h3><em>Advertising</em></h3>
<p><strong><em></em></strong>We are also opening up the site and podcast to outside advertisers for the first time in SCOREcast history. Manufacturers and developers have hounded us about this for years, but I&#8217;ve been a big proponent of us thoroughly researching this tactic before we actually pulled the trigger. I have always believed that the unique authority we&#8217;ve built so quickly within the community has come about partly because we are beholden to no one—we&#8217;ve never taken corporate sponsors, advertising money, or endorsements by anyone other than the aforementioned academic institutions. After years of careful research, thought and consideration, the Advisory Board has devised a way to enable software and gear manufacturers to partner with SCOREcast in advertising to our community without a muzzle being placed on our contributors, product reviewers, and authors. I am very pleased and excited about this model for advertising on <a href="../../..">SCOREcastOnline.com</a>, and you will start seeing the first of these partnerships towards the beginning of 2012.</p>
<h3><em>Chapter Communities</em></h3>
<p><strong><em></em></strong>In 2009, we launched <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/composium/">SCOREcast: London</a>—our very first international Chapter Community. James Semple, our SCOREcast: London chapter director, has done one hell of an amazing job cultivating and caring for the large SCOREcast community of UK composers in that region of the world. Off the success of SCOREcast: London, we also launched <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/sco.socal/">SCOREcast: Hollywood</a>, which blew up with over 125 community members within the first two hours of launching, and is being spearheaded by Los Angeles composer Johnny Knittle and his team. We are now training chapter directors for Boston, Austin, Berlin, and Toronto with our &#8220;SCO In a Box&#8221; program, and we plan to launch several more Community Chapters throughout 2012.</p>
<h3><em>Senior Editorial Staff</em></h3>
<p>To better serve our readership and community, we are adding to the editorial staff that will oversee each of the previously mentioned channels. Our international team of contributing writers, reviewers, community managers, and forum moderators has grown exponentially and we are excited to introduce all of these people to you over the next three weeks as we roll out our anniversary festivities.</p>
<h2>Thank YOU</h2>
<p>Thank you. Thank <em>YOU</em>. You have been huge in this, and you may not even realize it. All of the commenting, the visits, the <a href="http://twitter.com/scorecastonline" target="_blank">Retweets</a>, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SCOREcastOnline" target="_blank">Facebook</a> status messages, the discussion, the debate, the disagreeing, the nods of approval, the sharing&#8230; it all has meant so much to us. It really keeps us going. It makes this all worthwhile in every way. Please don&#8217;t stop. Keep helping us spread the message that a career in the film, television, and game music industry is one of the most rewarding and creative careers out there.</p>
<p>Thank you for sticking with us for five long years. We&#8217;re ALL excited to see what happens this year. If you want to be even more involved than you are now—to take the next step and become part of the team around here—<a href="mailto: scorecastonline@gmail.com" target="_blank">drop us a line</a> and let us know what you have in mind. There are many places to serve. It&#8217;s a big community!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Community is really the driving force behind everything that we do at SCOREcast. Here is where we are taking that concept this year with a more intense focus.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First off, happy New Year from all of us here at SCOREcast! I truly hope that you were able to chill out a little this week, spend some quality time with people who are important to you, and steal a few quiet moments for yourself to reflect on the year that was and the year that&#8217;s headed this way in just a couple more days.</p>
<p>Secondly, you might notice we&#8217;ve done a little bit of year-end sprucing up around here a bit at <a href="../../.." target="_blank">SCOREcastOnline.com</a>. I&#8217;ve challenged our contributor team this year to really focus on one thing with as much intent as they can: <strong>Community</strong>.</p>
<h4>Community Chapters</h4>
<p>Community is really the driving force behind everything that we do at SCOREcast, and it is community that will unite us across all borders and help to keep our profession of putting notes on paper thriving through the next season of filmmaking evolution. We have already begun to take some major steps to bring our global composing community together through the creation of community chapters, beginning with the recent launch of our first international</p>

<dt class="wp-caption-dt"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/12/sco-bbq.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1053" title="sco-bbq" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/12/sco-bbq-300x221.jpg" alt="2010 SCO Community BBQ" width="300" height="221" /></a></dt>
<dd class="wp-caption-dd">The 2010 Inaugural SCO LA Meet-Up</dd>
</dl>
<p>community chapter, <a href="../../../2010/12/announcing-scorecast-london.html" target="_blank">SCOREcast: London</a>. As I mentioned in my <a href="../../../2010/12/announcing-scorecast-london.html" target="_blank">announcement</a> of the London chapter, I&#8217;ve also started talking to potential SCO community leaders in Austin, New York, Rio, Ubeda, Moscow, and several other cities around the world. We will be announcing several more SCO communities in the next year, but if you feel that you live in an area that would benefit from organizing a local SCO chapter, I want to invite you to give us a <a href="../../../contact" target="_blank">shout</a> and let us know.</p>
<p>With the professional film music community expanding exponentially every year, one of our goals at SCO is to enable the industry to grow smaller as it grows larger. Your community chapters will feature local meet-ups, organized social and professional events, and special arrangements with orchestras and scoring stages in your area. There are a lot of incredible things that we&#8217;ll be launching, so keep your eyes and ears tuned to the website for more info as we roll this out.</p>
<h4>SCO Community Integration</h4>
<p>Internally, we are also taking some very exciting steps to bridge the gaps between composers and post-production professionals. With Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and all of the other social networking sites that are available, the community feels a little bit fractured—some people are on Twitter but not on Facebook, while others aren&#8217;t using any social networking tools at all. Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to have all of that functionality in one place where we can all trade insider secrets and talk shop on a single organized platform? Well, we are in the final stages of tweaking a platform here on SCOREcastOnline.com that will enable us to do just that. I cannot let the cat out of the bag just yet, but I&#8217;m excited to be let a little out: I&#8217;ll be launching a very cool new project with our contributor team this year that will be unlike anything that has ever been made available for professional composers. And &#8220;professional&#8221; is the key word—it is very important to the unique mission of SCOREcast that we stay true to the fact that we are all working pros. We aren&#8217;t a fan site, a film music collector&#8217;s blog, or a forum for plug-ins and software. We may talk about those kinds of things from time to time, but there are <a href="http://www.vi-control.net" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">far better sites</a> that cater to those crowds and I highly recommend <a href="http://www.tracksounds.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">them</a> if that&#8217;s your thing.</p>
<p>That being said, what we do <em>well</em> around here is that we cater to pros as well as emerging composers. In fact, we conducted an extensive survey this summer of our readership—many of you got the memo and participated. It turns out the the majority of people actively reading SCOREcastOnline.com and listening to the SCOREcast Podcast are working professional composers (composers that are currently scoring a feature film for release or a network television series) in London and Berlin, New York and Los Angeles. Our second largest audience are film music students. So, essentially, we have two very distinct audiences, and neither has much in common with the other, frankly. As a lot of you know, there is a vast gap between film school graduation and the real world of scoring feature films.</p>
<h4>A Sophisticated Framework&#8230;</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m telling you all of this because I want to prepare you for the new way that we will roll out features this year. Some of what we have coming will be of a &#8220;premium&#8221; nature, while other things we do will be as free as it has always been. Some of the stuff we launch will be by &#8220;invitation only&#8221; at first, while the majority of it will be open to all. Before you panic, I will tell you that the things that are going to cost you dough to participate in are not &#8220;seminars&#8221; at a banquet hall in Chatsworth or some clumsy &#8220;eBook&#8221; that we throw together and charge you twenty bucks for. My biggest impetus for designing SCOREcast five years ago was to try to keep anyone else from ever being taken advantage of again by any seminar, snake-oil salesman, or book that tried to sell you &#8220;the way to the top&#8221;. No&#8230; anything with a premium on it around here will be things that you would certainly have no problem paying for if your budget allows—things that are well worth your time and attention. We are not in this to make money. There is no need for that. However, as a central voice in the professional film music community, our team has access to people and places that many other resources do not, and since quality often demands a price, we&#8217;ll be paying a price to bring you those resources. In turn, we&#8217;ll cover part of those costs via premium tuition and pricing.</p>
<h4>&#8230;For a Sophisticated Community</h4>
<p>The reason we are looking at doing things that way is because of the sophistication of our craft and what SCO&#8217;s role in preserving that sophistication will be moving forward. <a href="../../../author/rbellis" target="_blank">Richard Bellis</a> and I have been talking about that a lot lately, actually, and it is a very necessary shift that we all need to make in our minds. Film music is not what it used to be, and this community of people is not the comradeship it once was, either. I&#8217;m not a huge proponent of looking backward, but I think we can safely deduce that while technology has advanced us in the area of efficiency, it has also stolen from us a bit in the area of intimacy. We don&#8217;t interact with one another the way we once did, and that is a contributing factor to why the perceived value of our craft is declining over time. It is time to put the brakes to any further erosion and work together to educate the masses as to the sophistication of film composing again. It isn&#8217;t a laptop and a copy of Reason. The Teamsters get that, orchestras get that, executives even get that. Now it is time or <em>us</em> to get it, too.</p>
<p>This has just been the very tip of the iceberg. In the next several weeks, we are going to be crazy busy launching what I think is the best stack of stuff we&#8217;ve put out there yet. I want to thank EVERYONE who has worked super hard these last few weeks to put all of this together. Many of you reading this right now had a hand in the creation of some of the tools we are positioning for, and I owe you a lot for that dedication.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to 2011—the year of community!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dearest SCOREcast Army,</p>
<p>The quality of film music born out of the United Kingdom is legendary and needs no introduction. With several talented orchestras and many skilled composers, the UK has become a major player in the film music industry, and a go-to destination for realizing a film score with supremely talented musicians.</p>
<p>Today, I&#8217;m excited to announce SCOREcast&#8217;s very first organized international chapter, <em><strong>SCOREcast: LONDON</strong></em>. Headed by London-based composer James Semple, <em><strong>SCOREcast: LONDON</strong></em> will provide a local community structure for film music professionals who are working in and around the greater London area. With a strong following already in place—thanks to Semple&#8217;s former <em>Composium</em> group—SCOREcast: LONDON will move ahead in 2011 with regular chapter meetings, organized events, and continued partnerships with the London Symphony Orchestra, English Session Orchestra, and a wonderful roster of studios in metropolitan London. Along side future SCOREcast chapters, <em><strong>SCOREcast: LONDON</strong></em> will also endeavor to help find strategic ways to bridge working relationships between composers worldwide.</p>
<p>SCOREcast is pleased to welcome all UK composers into the SCOREcast family, and we ALL are looking forward to a busy and musical 2011!</p>
<p>Looking toward the future of our craft,</p>
<p><strong>Deane Ogden</strong><br />

		<description><![CDATA[Nothing lasts forever. It's time to face the end of an era. Much, much more after the jump...]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First of all, don&#8217;t let the headline of this post freak you out. &#8220;All Good Things Must Come to an End&#8221; refers specifically to the self-imposed hiatus that the beloved <a href="../../podcast" target="_blank">SCOREcast podcast</a> has been on for close to a year.</p>
<p>Gotcha!</p>
<p>In addition to the recent issues we&#8217;ve had with the RSS feed of the older podcast episodes (issues that are now <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/scorecastonline/status/6907931853324288" target="_blank">fixed</a>, by the way!), I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve noticed that we haven&#8217;t posted a new podcast episode since me and Randy Knaub&#8217;s <a href="../../../2010/01/scorecast-no-26-podcast-shownotes.html" target="_blank">wrap-up of the 2010 NAMM Show</a> back in January of this year. Many of you have written in from all over the world to ask the obvious questions: &#8220;Is it over?&#8221; &#8220;Is there <em>ever</em> going to be another SCOREcast podcast episode?&#8221; &#8220;Why did you stop doing the podcast?&#8221;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Well&#8230; I&#8217;m thrilled to report that we will be posting <em><strong>SCOREcast Episode 27</strong></em> in the next few weeks, and that the podcast will resume its regular episodic schedule throughout 2011.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know it&#8217;s been awhile, but yes&#8230; we are back, and I&#8217;m more excited than ever about what is in store for the podcast during the coming year. We&#8217;ll be shaking up the format quite a bit by adding some cool new segments including new roundtables with some of film music&#8217;s most respected composers, music editors, and directors, as well as more interviews, listener mail, and current film music industry news and commentary.</p>
<p>On top of all that, we also have a giant glaring question to answer: Who won our &#8220;SCOREcast Theme Contest&#8221;?</p>
<p>All of these things—and MORE!—will be answered and dealt with in <em><strong>SCOREcast Episode 27</strong></em><strong><em></em></strong>. Look for the new episode in the coming weeks!</p>
<p><strong>Where Have We Been?</strong><br />
First of all—it&#8217;s all <em>my</em> fault. I made the call to put the podcast on ice back in February for a few reasons:</p>
<p><em>Reason #1: We were crispy.</em><br />
It takes a lot to produce an episode of SCOREcast. When I started SCOREcast in 2006, I made it a personal rule to never allow the SCOREcast podcast or the SCOREcastOnline.com website (SCO) to eclipse any of our contributors&#8217; careers, or mine. By January 2010, three solid years of producing the podcast had caught up with me and the rest of the team and we needed a break. Now granted, that &#8220;break&#8221; was never intended to be quite so long&#8230; but stuff happens, work takes over, people get busy, and things get put on the back burner. Bottom line is—<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>we are back</em></span> and it&#8217;s going to be a great new year with fresh energy, new features, and a few new personalities that I&#8217;m excited for you to meet and get to know.</p>
<p><em>Reason #2: We needed more help.</em><br />
As a circumstance of SCOREcastOnline.com&#8217;s growing audience (we are now read by over 90,000 people every week), we needed to expand the SCO contributor team and concentrate on making sure that our infrastructure was able to withstand a continued run of the podcast show. One thing we have learned for sure is that the SCOREcast podcast remains the biggest viral gateway to SCOREcastOnline.com, therefore drilling into the website to improve some areas that we found lacking was a necessary focus over the summer. The production of the podcast would need to be temporarily suspended if we were going find the time to do that effectively.</p>
<p><em>Reason #3: We needed to find out a little more about YOU.</em><br />
Podcast technology is pretty damned amazing. The fact that anyone can produce a radio show, put it online, syndicate it worldwide, and build a constituency that they wouldn&#8217;t normally have access to is downright amazing. However, the technology is still in its infancy and one of the things that is yet to be perfected is the ability to keep track of exactly who is downloading and listening to your content. <em>Syndication</em> is a both a blessing and a curse. Yes, your content gets dispersed all over the Internet and rebroadcast from multiple outlets, giving you access to a huge potential audience. However, <em>that</em> process also makes it virtually impossible for you to track your audience via any hard data.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not even the <em>big</em> problem. It&#8217;s even harder to track whether or not your content is even useful to your audience once they have access to it. Because of that limitation, I needed convincing that we were providing the very best content that we could for all of you. In an effort to get a grip on what you guys are after from SCOREcast, we sent out a survey to a random selection of our SCO readership last month. Based on the data we received back from the survey, I think we&#8217;ve come up with a format and feature-set that will better serve our community overall. We&#8217;re going to run with it, and it&#8217;s full steam ahead from here on!</p>
<p><strong>Onward and Upward</strong><br />
In hindsight, I&#8217;m pleased with the results that our hiatus produced, and I think you&#8217;ll agree that whatever annoyance our absence may have caused you has well been worth it. That being said, the responsibility of producing a successful podcast show is something I definitely do not take lightly, and I have learned a ton in the four years that I&#8217;ve been doing it. As with everything here at SCOREcast, the podcast is something that we all give to in our spare time. We may occasionally go AWOL, but we will always return.</p>
<p>And I promise&#8230; it will never again be as long a vacation as this one was!</p>
<p>My sincerest thanks to each and every one of you in the SCO Army who have hung in there with us.<br />
YOU are the true heroes of this community.</p>
<p>My very best,<br />

		<description><![CDATA[Rules. They are all around us. Often times, we impose them on ourselves as crutches to get us from one place to another creatively.... and we dont even realize it.

Why do we need rules? Do they help us or hurt us? Let's find out... together.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/06/logo_website_136px1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-777" title="logo_website_136px" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/06/logo_website_136px1.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>My assistant and I had a great discussion over an 11pm Taco Bell dinner last night (isn&#8217;t composing for Hollywood films just the most glamorous thing ever?). Our topic? <em>Rules</em>. We were talking, specifically, about the boxes we paint ourselves into as composers—those ways of doing that are now go-to methods for us. You know&#8230; methods and devices that have worked project after project, over and over, again and again.</p>
<p>At first, our conversation was about identifying these rules. Certain progressions that are used as devices for a particular filmic motion. Certain instrument choices that we might prefer over others. Particular ways of writing or orchestrating that we subconsciously move straight to without regard to how we might approach it differently this time around.</p>
<p>Next, we questioned, &#8220;Why do we enforce these rules on ourselves?&#8221; Is it laziness? Habit? Insecurity? Maybe it is based on historical success. Or maybe a rule still lingers from our educational background. What we were taught in music school or by our mentors; a childhood music teacher, perhaps.</p>
<p>Finally, we decided, &#8220;Screw the rules. Who needs them!&#8221; There are enough things in place that cannot be negotiated in this gig&#8230; why create more rigidity in the routine? Most rules only serve to hinder creativity and don&#8217;t provide anything valuable to the process anyway.</p>
<p>So&#8230; let&#8217;s practice it here first. Typically, we focus on a monthly theme at SCOREcastOnline.com, and our contributing editors follow it pretty well, always giving their own unique perspectives on the topic as professionals in the film music community. This month&#8230; it&#8217;s a free-for-all! No restrictions. No singular focus. And most importantly&#8230; NO RULES.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll take the lead tomorrow morning. I have no idea what I&#8217;ll talk about, but it will be some lesson I&#8217;ve learned this last month/year/decade about this gig, I can assure you that! Hopefully it will be beneficial to most of you; insightful if I&#8217;m lucky!</p>
<p>Most importantly, why not lend YOUR voice to the chorus? Click <a href="../../../contact" target="_blank">HERE</a> and send us an article on anything you think would benefit the professional film music community as a whole. Articles are easy to upload from that page, and there is even a place to upload your bio and photo for us to post under what you write. It can be on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>anything</em></span>&#8230; writing, orchestrating, business, networking, copying, editing, technical issues, what libraries are better than others, budgets, gear, fundamentals, organization, productivity, the union, workflow&#8230; whatever you want.</p>
<p>Are you telling yourself that you &#8220;don&#8217;t have time&#8221;? You are &#8220;too busy working&#8221;?</p>
<p>Yeah&#8230; me too. But isn&#8217;t that just another rule?</p>
<p>Maybe the most important &#8220;rule&#8221; of  being your own boss it that YOU get to decide what the rules are.</p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230;</p>

<p>Our inaugural year has been a total blast! I knew that if we could do something to more carefully connect our professional film music community,  amazing things would happen. What I didn&#8217;t count on was this community getting behind SCOREcast in the way that it has. Kudos to each and every one of you for building this community and really making this professional film music family an amazing group to be a part of. This website is for YOU!</p>
<p>Our first year online has been spent on Google&#8217;s awesome Blogger platform. However, with the expanding number of community-members posting relevant commentary and rich content, our daily readership is reaching into the 40,000&#8242;s, and we needed to make a change&#8230; badly.</p>
<p>We are now self-hosting the site on our own servers and have migrated to the more robust WordPress platform. For the last six days, my amazingly talented assistant, Duncan Kirk Bohannon, has been hand-coding this new version of the SCO experience, and I think you are going to love it!</p>
<p>Some of the enhancements include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Content Organization</strong> — Now you can search for articles in several of the most relevant categories we could think of (and actually&#8230; we are still thinking and wondering exactly what the 8 most relevant categories would be to pro film music makers, so if you have any suggestions, hit us up on the <a href="../../../contact" target="_blank">Contact</a> page).</li>
<li><strong>Better Post Tags</strong> — We&#8217;ve whittled down the tags on the site to make it easier for you to cruise around and view the content you really want to view. You can also view the entire tag list in the &#8220;Tags&#8221; section to the right and read a stream of content on *that* particular topic all on one page.</li>
<li><strong>Video and Audio Content</strong> — For a long time, we&#8217;ve needed the ability to not only post <em>audio</em> in our RSS site feed for you, but <em>video</em> as well. Now we can, and we plan to take extreme advantage of it!</li>
<li><strong>Easy Article Submissions</strong> — One of the best moves we made all year was inviting several of professional film music&#8217;s most exciting people to join our contributing editor team. But to truly have an all-encompassing community forum, the entire community needs to have a voice. We&#8217;ve now included article submission uploads on the <a href="../contact" target="_blank">Contact</a> page, and if you have an idea for a SCOREcast article&#8230; we&#8217;d LOVE to hear it!</li>
<li><strong>Social Network Sharing</strong> —As we all scramble to embrace the social networking technology that is making all of this possible, we thought it might be beneficial to include as many of the popular social networks in our sharing scheme as possible. In only one-click, you can now post your favorite SCOREcast content from any page to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/SCOREcastOnline" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/scorecastonline" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, Digg, Google Bookmarks, MySpace, Technorati, StumbleUpon, and a whole bunch of other networking sites. Spread the word!!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Podcasts</strong><br />
Of course, with a major move like this, we are still working out a few bugs. On the new <a href="../../podcast" target="_self">Podcast page</a>, you can listen the last dozen podcast episodes in a slick new pop-out player that resides next to that episode&#8217;s corresponding shownotes. We are still working to get the podcast player that you are used to up on the front page, and it might take a few cracks at it until we figure out the best solution for that. Believe me, we are as anxious as you are to get Episode 27 on the air&#8230; give us a little more time, and we&#8217;ll deliver (famous last words of a film composer!).</p>
<p><strong>Comments</strong><br />
Also, most of your previous <em>comments</em> are showing up in all posts,while others still have yet to migrate over. Still yet, for a few posts, we were simply unable to hang onto *all* of the comments. With a move like this, we basically jumped through three hoops that make for a big combined &#8220;no no&#8221; when you are designing a website transition: <em>hosting jumps</em>, <em>domain transfers</em>, and <em>platform switching</em>. We did all three simultaneously, and the casualty of war was a few comments here and there. You can still COMMENT in the same way you always have—log in or create a <a href="http://disqus.com" target="_blank">Disqus</a> account by simply leaving your first comment after any post—but some of your previous posts will take a little more monkeying on our end to get back in the system.</p>
<p>All-in-all, there are over 200 enhancements that have gone into this new version of SCO. I wish I could list them all here&#8230; but, frankly, I don&#8217;t know what 199 of them mean! (&#8220;<em>I&#8217;m a film composer, Jim&#8230; not a web designer!&#8221;</em>) ;-)</p>
<p>What I *do* know is that with this new upgrade, SCO is now poised to keep bringing you the quality content I believe we&#8217;ve come to be known by, for the next several years, as well as expanding that content to include new and developing ways to communicate with YOU—our over 40,000 daily online readers. In the coming weeks, you&#8217;ll witness even more opportunities for interaction with your professional film music family at SCO, and we are excited to see what happens with it all. For now, cruise around, kick the tires a bit, and <a href="../../../contact" target="_self">hit us back</a> with any features you&#8217;d like to see in the future.</p>
<p>This is YOUR community&#8230; Build it, challenge it, question it, ponder it, lead it, love it, live it!</p>

He&#8217;ll be back next week to challenge you with an all new Weekend Provocation.</p>
<p>Right now, though, I have a HUGE announcement to make…<br />
<a name="more"></a><br />
Last year, over Memorial Day weekend, we launched SCOREcastOnline.com. The idea for a SCOREcast website seemed like the obvious move in the natural progression from the SCOREcast podcast episodes, and felt like a necessary step toward our goal of bringing the professional film music community closer.</p>
<p>At the time of the launch, we weren&#8217;t sure if an SCO site would be a raging success, or go over like a lead balloon. I&#8217;m happy to report that because of your loyalty as subscribers, the word of mouth that makes our industry the great harbor that it is, and quality, consistent content from the best people working in film music, you have grown this website community to over 40,000 hits… PER DAY.</p>
<p>And this weekend, we&#8217;ll be upping the ante again.</p>
<p>We are moving the site to a new host and making a significant site modification to SCO on Saturday night. If you visit SCO between 4pm (PST) Saturday and Sunday evening, you might find it to be &#8220;down for maintenance&#8221; or, in the case of whatever browser you might be using, you&#8217;ll encounter a &#8220;this site cannot be found&#8221; error message.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry—we are simply uploading the new website and we will be back with a vengeance on Monday morning, bright and early.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t spill too many beans here (you&#8217;ll be pleasantly surprised Monday morning, I&#8217;m certain of it!), but this simple yet significant &#8220;next-level&#8221; modification to the way we do chicken around here will set SCO up for the next several years of growth, killer written content, audio and video (!) podcast episodes, and many more exciting features that we wouldn&#8217;t be able to offer you if we were to simply stay put and maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>But then again… we aren&#8217;t really the type to do *that* anyway!</p>
<p>Thank you—from the bottom of my heart—for making SCO such a runaway success. If we can do this in one year, imagine what we can do in two!</p>
<p>All my best,<br />
Deane Ogden<br />

<div style="margin: 0px;">Many of us on the core SCO Editorial Team get a lot of emails and questions about &#8220;delivery&#8221;. How do we deliver stems, cues, paperwork, contracts, demos, final dub materials, materials for mixing, materials for mastering, etc.? In the whirlwind that is The Final, how does one keep track of sessions, cue numbers, file versions, takes, tracking lists, schedules, and the like? Further down the process, when all is said and done, the score is delivered, and the client is happy, how do you follow up with final invoicing? Who does the cue sheets for the PROs? Who makes sure that the people you&#8217;ve sub-contracted out to (orchestrators, copyists, studio rentals, engineers, mixers, equipment cartage companies, etc.) get paid?</div>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<div style="margin: 0px;">This month at SCOREcast, we will attempt to answer all of these questions, and more. We&#8217;ll be looking at what happens between the time you finish writing your final notes of music and the time you leave for the tropical getaway you&#8217;ve been dreaming of since your director first said six weeks ago, &#8220;That&#8217;s not really working for me!&#8221;</div>
<div style="margin: 0px;">As always, we&#8217;ll have some special guests popping in to say hello as well as articles from your favorite SCO editorial staffers who are all working professionals from within the post-production industry.</div>
<div style="margin: 0px;">COMMENTS are always desired and encouraged, as the community doesn&#8217;t work without YOUR VOICE—so login below ANY post and say hello. Better yet, offer YOUR advice and methods of madness&#8230; the more we all share with and learn from each other the more beneficial the SCO community is the the Post community as a whole.</div>
<div style="margin: 0px;">Have a great month, and as always, thank you for making SCO a part of your daily read!</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marc Shaiman will tell you that one of his best-known scores, for <em>City Slickers</em>, came into this world with more than its fair share of agony.<em> </em>One of the toughest parts to write was the famous cattle-rustling scene—Shaiman says he was scared out of his mind by the temp track. He felt like &#8220;the ghost of Copland was standing over [his] shoulder.&#8221; It&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve all faced. Not from Copland, and not always from the temp track, but there&#8217;s a sort of intimidation that hits us once we&#8217;ve landed a really good gig.</p>
<p>Once in a while a project lands here at the Gulag that makes me sit up and take notice. Sure, I do my best work every time out, just like you all do, but you know what I mean. Some gigs just get under your skin. There&#8217;s something there that makes you want to knock it out of the park… show the world what you can do… get off your rear end and write the Great American Film Score.</p>
<p>All of which is usually followed by a sudden feeling of creative nausea. Musical constipation. Call it what you will—lots of people have called it lots of things, usually invoking some sort of unsavory gastrointestinal metaphor.</p>
<p>Instead of writing music, you&#8217;re <em>thinking</em> about writing music. You&#8217;re competing against some hypothetical &#8220;perfect score&#8221; (whatever that beast would sound like), instead of simply doing what you do. In other words, you&#8217;re making parts of the process conscious, even <em>self-conscious</em>, that ought to be subconscious. It&#8217;s a fast track to an unhappy ending.</p>
<p>And yet we&#8217;ve all been there. If you haven&#8217;t, kudos… but your moment will come.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how Shaiman handled it: he got out of his own way. He sat down at his piano and mentally let go of the whole cue for a little while. He played through a bunch of tunes he knew well, and knew he knew how to <em>play</em> well, just for enjoyment and distraction. Just to allow his mind to decompress a bit and regain its footing.</p>
<p>He was jamming along to an up-tempo gospel tune when the tape machine (now *that* dates this story, doesn&#8217;t it?) automatically reached the end of its pause-timer and resumed playing that cattle-rustling scene.</p>
<p>As the story goes, Shaiman looked at the now-unpaused video, and heard the music he was playing on the piano, and the two just… fit. He knew exactly how he was going to score the scene. Copland&#8217;s ghost was banished (either to a Mexican salon or an Appalachian spring, one supposes), and Shaiman got back to work.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t want to end this month of competition with the cliché about your toughest competition being yourself—there are a whole <em>lot</em> of us composers out there now, and some of us are pretty damned good! So that whole thing, Zen as it might be, just isn&#8217;t true.</p>
<p>Except when it is.</p>
<p>Make of all of this what you will… I hope in the weeks and months to come, you&#8217;ll get out there, compete, hustle, and kick down some doors. (and let us know how it goes, OK? We love to hear from you!)</p>

<p>Along with the amazing things that have come along with the exponential growth of the SCOREcast community over the last year, a small handful of &#8220;growing pains&#8221; have reared their ugly heads — an example being several truncated past podcast episodes at iTunes. This problem is due to the SCOREcast server at Gcast (where we&#8217;ve posted our podcast since birth) becoming too overloaded with traffic.</p>
<p>Simply put, Gcast never anticipated the major popularity of several of their podcast clients, including us, and so they have been forced to start shutting things off starting February 1st. While we have been talking with them and they are leaving our podcast hosting intact until we choose our next home, you might experience issues with older podcast episodes (including episodes that &#8220;cut off&#8221; in the middle of the broadcast), to which we truly do apologize.</p>
<p>Our solution is to work with a new company that is a leader in podcast distribution and make our podcasts available in even more outlets, to more composers and film music pros across the globe. We are close, but not quite ready for primetime with the new service. When we are, we will shout it from the rooftops here at the SCO site. Also, if you are worried that you have missed a few episodes and won&#8217;t be able to ever hear them again, rest easy — everything is fully backed-up and will be available via the new service and at iTunes.</p>
<p>Until then, you can keep expecting all of the fresh, daily, wholesome goodness you&#8217;ve come to expect from our top-notch editorial staff, as well as a few rabbits we have up our sleeves in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Thanks for staying faithful, thanks for staying true, and keep the conversations happening. It&#8217;s what this community is all about!</p>
<p>For film and music,</p>
<p>Deane, Lee, Jai and the SCOREcast Team</p>

When I talk to film scoring students, everything we discuss is framed around <em>facilitating their ability to say yes</em>… because just about the toughest thing you can have happen in your career is to land a gig before you&#8217;re ready for it. Facilitating your ability to say yes means that you&#8217;re identifying areas in which you need to improve so that you&#8217;re ready for anything.</p>
<p>Creatively, technologically, mentally, physically, emotionally and in all kinds of other ways, you have to be in a position to be better than the work deserves. Not that the project is necessarily bad—but, as Richard Bellis is fond of saying, &#8220;in order to move up, you have to be better than the material you&#8217;re scoring.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wrestling with your samples… if your team is still learning to work together… if you&#8217;re stressed out and sleep deprived… you might not be in a position to do your best work. In fact, you might not be in a position to say yes at all. What promises to be a big career boost can become a long-term career anchor—even something that knocks you back to Square One—if you can&#8217;t deliver.</p>
<p>If you follow SCOREcast faithfully this month, you&#8217;re going to pick up ideas and techniques that will, if applied regularly and with liberal amounts of hustle, bring in some gigs. Our kung fu is strong. By February you&#8217;ll have a few new moves to try out, and we&#8217;re going to get you psyched again about getting out into the world and kicking down the doors.</p>
<p>So, just between you and yourself, ask yourself: are you ready to get the gig?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/11/sig-bellis.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-598" title="sig-bellis" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/11/sig-bellis.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>EVOLUTION</strong><br />
There are few if any “constants” in our world. The only one Iʼm sure about is <em>evolution</em>. Change. This, then, may be the epitome of an oxymoronic phrase: “<em>The only constant is change</em>.”</p>
<p>This personal wisdom (if indeed it is either personal or wisdom) comes to me at sixty-three years of age. Many things are falling away at this age, but retrospect and derivative knowledge are the offsets. No young person, unless he or she is clairvoyant, can claim this perspective.</p>
<p>Evolution moves at a glacial pace. It moves like the growth of a tree, like the appearance of facial hair on a prepubescent male. It seems to move slower as our attention spans shorten. Often evolution is imperceptible due to this slow pace until it reaches critical mass. When it hits critical mass, mankind clusters in an effort to speed up evolution. Global warming will be solved, but the progress in alternative energy has, until recently, been glacial. All of a sudden it seems Iʼm not the only one with a ﬁve kilowatt solar array on his property.</p>
<p>In the big picture, evolution can be viewed as positive, but when broken into shorter periods its effects often seem negative. For example: smoking and obesity. Looking back we can see that acceptance of these lifestyles happened slowly… until recently, when that “cluster” of humanity decided to move these items to the top of the priority list and do something about them.</p>
<p>These are obvious, in-your-face examples. They affect large numbers of people from a health standpoint as well as a ﬁnancial perspective when you consider the cost of medical treatment for complications from both.</p>
<p>Our business, the business of creating music for ﬁlm, television, media (and whatever else might come along) is also evolving. By its very nature, our music is designed to be subliminal. It is consequently not in-your-face, and does not affect people as dramatically as cancer or diabetes. Any negative effects resulting from evolution will not easily be noticed. Nor will they motivate clusters of ﬁlmmakers, composers or even audiences to undo what has been done.</p>
<p>So, what am I saying? What is this “negative” evolutionary effect, and what is the cause? Should we do something about it, or will big-picture evolution eventually take care of it as is happening with smoking and obesity?</p>
<p>It was recently announced that China is contemplating sweeping changes to their higher education system. Apparently they have been teaching a very narrow curriculum, based almost entirely on existing knowledge. This dates back to the early days of communism and the belief that an education concentrated on a speciﬁc skill set, say engineering, would produce the worldʼs best in that particular ﬁeld. What has evolved as a result is a population with extremely good working skills, but without the ability to invent, imagine, probe or discover. It is now speculated that a more liberal education coupled with life experience is imperative to achieve these qualities.</p>
<p>When I ﬁrst became interested in Film Scoring (circa 1962) there was one book available on the subject: <em>Underscore</em>, by Frank Skinner. That was it. Only years later did <em>Sounds</em> <em>and</em> <em>Scores</em> by <a class="zem_slink" title="Henry Mancini" rel="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000049/">Henry Mancini</a> hit the market. You could not take a college course on ﬁlm scoring. As a matter of fact, no one could actually tell you how to become a ﬁlm composer. So the “burning desire” was sated by merely writing music—for anything and everything.</p>
<p>The result of all that writing was a musical vocabulary that was both diverse and personal. It would be the equivalent of the musical vocabulary accrued by the instrumentalist who has played in bands and orchestras from an early age. The other equally important adjunctive skill was working with a plethora of varied personalities. Jazzers, Vegas people, concert promoters, road managers, Top 40 acts, all with different visions and expectations about their music.</p>
<p>We now have courses in Film Scoring at most major universities. Some even offer a Masters degree in the subject. I had a student begin studying privately with me when he was only 16 years old. This proliferation of  possibilities for an education in ﬁlm and media music is the product of supply and demand. In the Sixties there were a handful of ﬁlm composers and that was enough. The process of making ﬁlms was slower (pre-digital, you know), so fewer ﬁlms were made and the tried and true professional composers could not only handle the workload but could prosper doing it.</p>
<p>Todayʼs ﬁlm composer community is extremely large. The size is reﬂected in all the college courses that have sprung up over the last 10 years. This makes competition keener, and consequently increases the need to start on this educational path as early as possible.</p>
<p>Compared to concert music, the amount of ﬁlm music available for study is miniscule. Less than a hundred yearʼs worth. And styles of ﬁlm music have changed so radically that, unless you are a history buff, you will likely be listening to examples from the last 5 or 10 years.</p>
<p><em><strong>Think China! Think variety!</strong></em></p>
<p>There have always been qualitative differences in ﬁlm music, even when there was only a handful of composers. There was good ﬁlm music and not-so-good ﬁlm music, but at least it emanated from the minds (some better equipped than others) of human beings. Human beings, each with a personalized musical vocabulary.</p>
<p>One of the undisputed technological accomplishments in recent times is what we often refer to as <em>emulation</em>. We write with an <em>emulated</em> orchestra—an <em>emulated</em> oboe or French Horn. This ability would be categorized as an “advance” in technology if it werenʼt for the fact that it is, as we speak, paving the way for—are you ready?— <em>EMULATED FILM MUSIC</em>.</p>
<p>“It sounds just like ﬁlm music!”</p>
<p>I started arranging at the ripe old age of 13. I was NOT a prodigy. I merely had an interest and, more importantly, a father who had been a dance band leader in the 30ʼs and was now a junior high school music teacher. MY junior high school music teacher.</p>
<p>Hereʼs the thing about the (almost lost) art of arranging: unless youʼre a student, there is NO emulation. Emulation would be anathema to arranging. As an arranger you take an existing song and try your damnedest to put it into a musical genre or setting in which it has never existed previously. This requires imagination. The same imagination that those whom we “emulate” have.  Technology and the internet have given us the ability to quickly and thoroughly analyze music. We can slow things down and grab every note and glissando in an effort to see what those “anointed” among us have done. This is the equivalent of Chinaʼs higher education based on existing knowledge.</p>
<p>For the gear junkies, or technogeeks, this is the best thing that could happen. It is the very justiﬁcation we need to buy that new library of sounds or those incredible reverbs. The better the sound, the more it sounds just like MUSIC! Whoo hoo!</p>
<p>Every year, for the past twelve years, I listen to the demos submitted by the top ﬁfty or sixty applicants to the ASCAP Television and Film Scoring Workshop. I know what I hear. There are a few very original works every year, but the majority are, to a greater or lesser degree, derivative.</p>
<p>This is NO FAULT OF THE EMERGING COMPOSERS WHO SUBMIT!</p>
<p>“Then whose fault is it?” you ask.</p>
<p>“Evolution,” I reply. And, subsequently, is it a “fault” at all?  Maybe itʼs just the new reality. Entertainment is changing; attention spans are changing. Hell, wars are changing. Governments are changing.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Iʼm not sure that there is anything to be done or that there is anything wrong… except that Iʼm betting you would like to ﬁgure out, in a “cattle call” world of media composers, how to get work. How to be noticed in the “herd.”</p>
<p>I used to open my classes with the following question: “How much money do you expect to make, annually, as a ﬁlm and television composer?”</p>
<p>Hereʼs the new question that starts off my class: “How many of you have: Stormdrum; East/West Gold or Platinum Orchestra; Vienna Symphonic Library Orchestra or Strings; Ivory; Hollywood Strings?”</p>
<p>“If you all have the same sample libraries, (and Iʼm thinking to myself, &#8220;…and are emulating Giacchino, Zimmer, Newton-Howard, Newman and Horner&#8221;), what separates you from everyone else?”</p>
<p>Now, once youʼre hired, you most likely will be asked to recreate the temp score while circumventing copyright infringement, but, at least in your demos, you have the freedom to be creative and, OMG, maybe even give the ﬁlmmaker an idea that doesnʼt already exist in at least one other ﬁlm.</p>
<p>When it boils down to merely a price war, no one wins. As I am known to ask, “How many $5,000.00 projects do you have to get every year to support yourself, your family and your gear while living in LA?”</p>
<p>By now you&#8217;re probably ready to go read something else unless I get to the point, and so I shall.</p>
<p>The computer is your tool box. You should set aside a period of time—between the viewing of the ﬁlm, scene or project and the time when you open your tool box—when the ONLY thing you do is something that can be done with your eyes closed.</p>
<p>The thing you possess, which no one else possesses, is your musical history of listening and playing. Your likes and dislikes; your musical tastes. These individual aspects of your work may not be perceived by the ﬁlmmaker as important, but they are the very factor that sets you apart from the herd.</p>
<p>Once you have the job, itʼs never about the music. Itʼs always about the ﬁlm. How you diagnose the dramatic impact of the ﬁlmmakerʼs vision is whatʼs important—NOT that you use Altiverb or sound just like “Whomever.” The determination of what is important to this particular ﬁlm or scene is not inside any library or sequencing software. I feel that the most damaging phrase in contemporary jargon is “Thatʼs cool.” Often, my response is “Very cool. Inappropriate, but very cool.”</p>
<p>Put your mind between the project and the computer.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was writing a cue last night, not for any particular project mind you, but just to write something. Who knows, maybe I&#8217;ll need it someday, right? It was <em>pretty</em> clear in my head, but not as crystal clear as other times. Sometimes I feel like I&#8217;m just regurgitating what I hear in my head! Not so last night, it was like trying to hold sand with my hands.</p>
<p>And it showed in the cue- it was not good. But it still sounded okay in my head, although it was still not totally clear.</p>
<p>Times like this make me wonder whether I should &#8220;abort mission&#8221; and walk away from the cue, or whether I should continue to hammer away at it, like some sort of blacksmith. I wonder how the SCOREcasters deal with such situations? Or is there some in-between ground, e.g., work on a different cue for a few days then return to it. What sometimes works for me is to just take my hands off the keys, close my eyes, and listen to the piece in my head, let it finish developing a bit more, bring it out of my subconscious.</p>
<p>Sometimes that works.</p>
<p>What do you do? Salvage your cue? Your time? Or some of both? I figured I&#8217;d throw it out there for you to chew on.</p>

<p>My big audacious goal was to stay up last night to watch this happen in real time, but I fell asleep like a loser and just didn&#8217;t have the stamina to hang in and watch it all unfold. :op<span class="fullpost"></p>
<p>This is a day that I&#8217;ve been waiting for for about three years – the day that SCOREcast grows up, takes the gloves off, puts its big-boy pants on and gets serious about mentoring, coaching, and helping people navigate through the jungle of the film music business.</p>
<p>This launch has not been without its obstacles, pratfalls, and perils &#8211; most of them technical, of course &#8211; as we&#8217;ve tried to figure out the best way to bring you all the content you want and have come to expect from the SCOREcast podcasts over the years. But the biggest challenge was not technical at all. In all honesty, my biggest fear was that some of you might be thinking what I would be thinking if I were you: &#8220;Oh great! Another film music site that is going to over-promise and under-deliver. Another site that is going to tell me how much they can help me if I sign up for their membership, download their guide, and attend their seminar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well&#8230; no. Actually, not at all. When we started broadcasting podcast episodes in October of 2006, I promised myself that if we ever made it difficult for people to get into the film music world by making them jump through a bunch of hoops to get to our content, then we have failed at our objectives. I&#8217;ve said it before on the podcast, and I&#8217;ll say it again here: There has never been a better time for you to launch your career in film music, and SCOREcast is a tool for you to use to accomplish that goal. Pure and simple. No strings attached. Besides, the best things in life are still free, baby!</p>
<p>But in all seriousness, that IS the essence of SCOREcast: Helping you launch and maintain a healthy, lasting, and fruitful film music career. Here you will find seasoned mentors as well as people who have never written a note. Here you will find people who are interested in sharing with you the TRUTH about how they got into this business, as well as people who will share with you the TRUTH about why they never quite made it. Here you will find those who are not afraid to talk to you about what you should be doing, as well as those who will tell you what you are doing right.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all been there. Everyone started somewhere. Whether we were assistants to composers or scoring student films for pizza and beer, we&#8217;ve all been at the crossroads of not knowing where to go next to get to the next level in our careers. So, this is where all of that wondering and not knowing can change for you as you peel back the onion that is this business.</p>
<p>My advice? Get involved here at SCOREcastOnline.com. <span style="font-style: italic;">Login for free</span> (!!!) and get to know some folks. There are thousands of people here that listen to our podcasts every month that are in the same boat you are in, and there are just as many that have achieved in this business what you desire to achieve in your own career. So why reinvent the wheel? Find those people &#8211; they love to talk about this stuff &#8211; and get to know them. The new way of the world is &#8220;access&#8221;. Use it that opportunity here at SCOREcastOnline.com and be enriched by it.</p>
<p>As SCOREcast launches into this new era, come on the ride with us. I promise it will be worth the adventure!</span></p>
