				<description><![CDATA[Discussing spotting is a subject unto itself. Here, Emmy-winning sound mixer David Fluhr talks about the advantages, disadvantages, pluses and minuses of spotting a project with both the composer AND the sound designer in the room with the director.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<p>This subject has been of particular interest to me and has sparked a lot of interest among my colleagues in Post Production. Discussing <em>spotting</em> is a subject unto itself. But are there advantages to spotting a project with the Composer AND the Sound Designer present with the Director? Sitting down in a room—all together—with the same goal in mind: helping the Director tell the story. On the surface, it seems like a no-brainer. Why NOT do this? Save time and energy; reduce the classic &#8216;conflicts&#8217; during the final mix; The left hand knows what the right hand is going to do; Efficient; Cost saving; Keeps the creative focus;  Ah, if it were only that simple.</p>
<p>I had the chance recently to talk with a few Sound Designers, and the results were sometimes surprising, though overall very encouraging. As varied as the personalities are, that pretty much tells the story: There is no ONE WAY to spot, design sound, compose music, or approach a project. The common thread through the discussions was always positive. I hope we can all share some gems in the end.</p>
<p>One of the most common challenges we encounter during a final mix, whether it be a film, television show, or any sound for picture project, is the time when all the faders are open and we run all the sound elements to see what we have. It is right then when it can be revealed that everyone has tried to do the same things- playing the action, playing the drama, tension, etc, all at the same time. Action scenes are loaded to the brim with sound effects-everything that moves gets a sound. The orchestra is playing right along with our characters on screen as they fly through the air. The aural spectrum is full to the brim with high end, mid range, and sub harmonics. And of course, the sonic result is usually undefined, muddy, and way too loud.</p>
<p>It is at that moment that we all turn to each other with the knowing glances of trepidation. Who will say it first? &#8220;Clearly&#8230; we need to sort out the material and our approach!&#8221; The process continues in whichever order is decided upon, each element being explored and sorted through. Discussion of which elements will take the lead ensues, necessitating listening to everything presented so that a creative decision can be made based on the materials provided. The score is played solo, and the arc of the music is analyzed, with each special interest listening, looking for places to trade off for the material they have brought to the game. Experimentation follows (which of course, is not a totally bad thing&#8230; and can be VERY good for the creative process). Then, a game plan begins to form, getting mapped out, and executed.</p>
<p>Projects have been mixed like this with great success, obviously. But in these days of shrinking budgets, less mix time, and other pressures, is this really the most efficient/best way to approach our mixes? All the hard work done by sound editors and mixers and composers can get &#8216;covered up&#8217;, never really presented as originally intended. Potentially, no one could end up truly happy with the final result, because it ends up to be a series of compromises. Or, sound elements can get &#8216;dumped&#8217; completely before even being given a chance to breathe life into a film. I&#8217;ve heard it all—&#8221;We paid a lot of money for that score, and we&#8217;re gonna hear it!&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ve spent weeks designing those sounds, and we HAVE to hear them!&#8221; These days, synthesizers are not strictly in the realm of the composer. Nor, are ambiences or sound effects off limits for the music department to use. Tonal ambiences, pads, winds, backgrounds, eerie or calming effects are fair game for anyone with a Protools or other workstation, to be modified or altered ad infinitum. The creative choices and possibilities have never been as exciting.</p>
<p>There is no one answer, and no one single approach. In a bid to bridge the gaps between our perspective areas of focus and expertise, we find much to discuss. Factors such as ego, collaboration, team work, confidence, and just plain doing the right thing for the film all come into play.</p>
<p>I posed questions to some friends over these past few weeks, and I&#8217;d love to share their insights with you. I asked them about spotting with the director and the composer—pros and cons. Is it better to be working separately or together? I asked for anecdotes, stories they were willing to share (there were a few that couldn&#8217;t be published!). How often was the spotting actually followed through to the final mix? Do the benefits outweigh any negatives? What about file sharing during the editorial process?</p>
<p>Here are their thoughts:</p>
<h2>RANDY THOM</h2>
<p><strong><em>Sound Designer and Director of Sound Design—Skywalker Sound<br />
</em></strong><strong><em>(The Last Airbender, War of the Worlds, The Simpsons Movie)</em></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s always a good idea to have a spotting session that includes the Director, Picture Editor, Composer, and Sound Designer or Supervising Sound Editor. It&#8217;s the best way I know to avoid a train wreck of uncoordinated sound in the final mix. Too many Directors misguidedly think the best approach is to simply tell the Composer that it&#8217;s 100% his/her job to make the scene work sonically, and in a separate meeting they tell the Sound Designer the same thing. They think that by having both departments &#8220;go for it&#8221; they&#8217;ll get the best of both worlds, and that they&#8217;ll be able to cherry pick the best stuff in the final. What&#8217;s more likely to happen is that when all the faders are opened on the first day of the final mix it sounds like you&#8217;re standing next to Niagara Falls. It&#8217;s just a bunch of uncorrelated noise that you have to spend hours and hours if not days and days trying to make sense of, and it often winds up with nobody being very happy with the result.</p>
<p>Occasionally the music and effects departments can divide up the spectrum&#8230; score will be all high strings and woodwinds while sound effects will be the bass end of the spectrum&#8230; but in my experience, the cases where that kind of arrangement is possible are rare.</p>
<p>Robert Zemeckis has always been great about making sure from early on that the score and the sound effects complement each other instead of detract from each other. Alan Silvestri and I have often spotted with Bob together, though it isn&#8217;t really necessary now because we&#8217;re so used to handing the sonic baton back and forth that it comes naturally. There is this tenacious myth among many Directors that it&#8217;s desirable for huge music and huge sound effects to play simultaneously in action sequences. If they would take the time to analyze the great sequences in film sound they would quickly realize that in almost all cases either the music or the sound effects drives a moment or a sequence, and the other is either clearly subordinate or isn&#8217;t there at all. That is actually the case regardless of whether it&#8217;s loud or quiet, action packed or simple and slow. You have to make choices. Simply pushing all the faders to the top and hoping it&#8217;s going to sound good isn&#8217;t mixing. Making those crucial choices should begin in the spotting session. Ideally you then have some time to try that approach with mock-up score and mock-up effects, because you never know what&#8217;s going to work until you try it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>GREGORY KING</h2>
<p><strong><em>Supervising Sound Editor<br />
</em></strong><strong><em>(Ali, Friday Night Lights, Hancock)</em></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Spotting with both the composer and director is very positive. It allows me to hear the comments and thoughts the director is passing on to the composer. As a sound designer, I am trying to build a track that elicits an emotional reaction from the audience. This emotional reaction can be fear, anger, happiness, sadness or anxiety—any emotion really. The composer is trying to do the same thing, so by hearing the requests the director is asking of the composer allows me to interpret this information and apply it to my work. And I believe the same could be said for the composer hearing what the director says to me.</p>
<p>Spotting together is good for an almost real time run through of the movie with discussion as we go. To both be together for a detailed spotting would be very time consuming. I don&#8217;t need to know exactly when a cue is starting or ending, and I&#8217;m sure the composer can do without hearing about specific sound effects. But mood, feel and general orchestration of a cue within a particular scene or sequence is valuable.</p>
<p>This works on an individual film basis. In movies like big action films or romantic comedies we already know what the other guy is going to deliver. It&#8217;s different with dramas, thrillers and mysteries where moods and subtleties play a much bigger role. Animation is a different beast altogether, generally both the sound designer and music department are creating and delivering tracks to the picture department sometimes years before the film mixes, so we&#8217;re always aware of what the other guy is doing.</p>
<p>In my experience, the spotting notes are followed through to the end fairly often. Of course there are always changes to the way we may handle an effects driven scene and the composer changes the context of a cue, but generally things seem to stay pretty close, at least in concept. I have been involved with films where the score will take a radical departure from what was originally discussed, but that is typically a result of the filmmakers wanting to dry a different overall approach.</p>
<p>I think the benefits of spotting with the Composer outweigh any negatives. We are all trying to achieve the same goal of helping the director tell his story as best he can. Interaction and discussion between all of us involved can only be helpful. At the very least, you get to meet some very talented and passionate people working on the same film as you. At it&#8217;s very best you help elevate the film to a higher level.</p>
<p>John Powell and I did this, and collaborated on &#8220;Hancock&#8221;, and I think it helped a lot. I also visited the scoring stage wherever possible and John came by the dub stage often. This was one of those films where the concept of the score and overall mood of the movie was constantly evolving, so it was very necessary to stay involved with what each of us was up to. Typically though, with schedules as they are, both the composer and the sound designer are in full hustle mode. We have our heads at our desks, keyboards, and computer monitors&#8230; just trying to get the thing done. Most often the scoring stage starts while we are pre-dubbing, so prior to the final mix we can only exchange mock-ups which are usually in a state of flux due to picture changes, or new visual effects, or the joy of all joys&#8230; another temp dub.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>KELLY CABRAL</h2>
<p><strong><em>Supervising Sound Editor</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>(Alpha Dog, The Notebook, The Perfect Storm)</em></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say I really see any downside at all to spotting with the composer. It doesn&#8217;t work anymore to be separated. Years ago, we had a lot more time on the stage to sort situations out that didn&#8217;t work sonically with Sound and Music, but that luxury is not available to us anymore. We need to be very specific now about how our time is spent on a mixing stage. Every time a music cue changes it changes the entire feeling of a scene and we have to remix—and sometimes redo—the sound design to get it right. Having said that, the more we are simpatico with the composer, the more focused our tracks can be. I transfer files back and forth all the time with composers so I can stay in sync with them. It works great. I am in a situation right now on a temp dub where they changed a music cue and didn&#8217;t tell me and now all my sound design isn&#8217;t working&#8230; so much that we had to go back to the old music since we didn&#8217;t have time to redo all the design.  I don&#8217;t see any good reason not to blend together all music and sound since it ultimately needs to be one feeling for a scene.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>JON JOHNSON</h2>
<p><strong><em>Supervising Sound Editor</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>(The Blind Side, Grey Gardens, The Last House On the Left)</em></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It seems to be a great idea, in theory, to include Composer and Sound Supervisor during a spotting and is a great way to save time for the Director and the Picture Editor. It&#8217;s been my experience, in the three or four times I&#8217;ve been included in this type of spotting, that it could also have the potential to waste an inordinate amount of time for either me or the composer. The majority of my spotting time is to clarify and connect real world aspects, such as A.D.R., off stage sounds, foley discussions, and those areas seem to be unwittingly compromised with the composer in the room. The general intent, in my opinion, of the music discussion with the composer is about dramatic intent and timbre of desired emotion of a scene and film, and, unless there&#8217;s a production musical piece involved, requires a much different shape of creative sense to discuss the musical themes and resultant dramatic resolutions through the movie.</p>
<p>It works, however, if all involved realize that this spotting session is the beginning, and will continue to evolve. If it&#8217;s viewed as the only time that all hats will be in the same room, it&#8217;s trouble down the road. Furthermore, whenever I&#8217;ve adhered copiously to the notes taken during sessions, I&#8217;ve sometimes had to go against my intuition to cover an event as I would have been inclined to, as the combined spotting notes were implicit in the overall sound being a musical moment only. Unfortunately, that previously &#8220;music-only&#8221; scene was lacking in dramatic finish and I looked to be unprepared. Why? Because the idea of rigidity in intent is not necessarily what a good mix should be.</p>
<p>A much better arrangement, in my experience, is having the composer screen the temp version film with the Dialogue and Effects track open and the Music track available for his/her use, if and when he/she wants to hear it. Christopher Young did this with the film &#8220;Unforgettable&#8221;, which had a large section of chase and sound design moments, and he did a brilliant job of weaving percussion and handing off hits in sound effects moments. Richard Marvin is very good at this type of arrangement, also.  Rick and I were subliminally communicating well enough that I&#8217;d remembered a cue that was tried and abandoned that during the mixing of the scene in &#8220;U-571&#8243;, that lent itself perfectly to a new direction that the movie mix needed to go in. It went back in. Rick paid me a fiver and the movie improved immensely for the change.</p>
<p>The ability to listen to the direction of a mix as it shapes itself is what a good film mix should be. Mixing a movie is a process, not a &#8216;to-do&#8217; list. I&#8217;ve seen more good ideas and improvements gone by the wayside during a mix because of a subtle narrow mindedness of schedule, rather than being open to opportunity.</p>
<p>As you can see, I&#8217;m sometimes hesitant to spot with the composer, BUT&#8230; I&#8217;d be a fool not to try it again and use the shortcomings learned in previous combined sessions, increase the communication avenues, and continue to find new ways to make things better and improved. That success has been by screening of temps, previews, and in the least, communication via the OMF by temp mockups supplied by the composer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>CAMERON FRANKLEY</h2>
<p><strong><em>Supervising Sound Editor</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>(Terminator Salvation, Live Free Or Die Hard, Mr. and Mrs. Smith)</em></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It is always valuable to know firsthand what the filmmaker imagines their track to sound like, both from a technical aspect (problems with production) and creatively (what best tells the story they are trying to tell). Often times they know what they want to lead with in any given scene; music or FX. (Given the fact that dialogue always needs to be in the forefront). Although, typically a composer knows that gunshots will be in the gun battle and the sound designer knows that the gun battle will have music. Typically they will play together in the mix and likely trade off moments. The other scenario being that the filmmaker knows up front exactly how to play the scene, choosing one over the other. For example, a car chase can feel more realistic without music (check out &#8220;The French Connection&#8221;).</p>
<p>I have spotted in what I believe to be, probably every possible scenario. The picture editor has always been present and the rest of the players revolve. On my current film &#8220;Due Date&#8221;, I spotted with the picture editor and the producer. On &#8220;Live Free Or Die Hard&#8221;, I spotted with the picture editor, director, and composer&#8230; and on other films there have been times that I brought along a large portion of my crew.</p>
<p>As long as the ideas are conveyed, it&#8217;s all good. So many sonic moments in a movie are developed during the actual process of scoring and sound design, that only after they are reviewed and discussed do we really know the final course the track will take. The track can even change direction. I do believe that in regard to spotting, &#8220;Plan A&#8221; is a good place to start, and we all know what happens to &#8220;Plan A&#8221;! Good thing that there are 25 more letters in the alphabet!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>GEORGE WATTERS</h2>
<p><strong><em>Supervising Sound Editor</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>(Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#8217;s End, National Treasure, Gone In Sixty Seconds)</em></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>George and I discussed this topic during a phone conversation, and he had some great input for us. He welcomes this concept as a great idea, and shared with me some of his experiences.</p>
<p><em>During &#8220;Pearl Harbor&#8221;, director Michael Bay, composer Hans Zimmer and George picked areas in advance where music would be predominant, and others where sound effects would take the lead. For this film, it worked marvelously. The impact of all the sound elements was heightened by the pre-planned use of music and effects. Music was much more effective when it wasn&#8217;t &#8216;wall to wall&#8217;, and effects drove some scenes taking the lead with full force. By planning and leaving room for effects, the film&#8217;s story arc was enhanced, and not derailed. The plans made during spotting followed through to the final mix.</em></p>
<p><em>All of this was possible because it was the right combination of people. Everyone had the same mission. Even during the final playback of the finished film, there were areas that needed to be thinned out, and modified. It is during playbacks that the thread of music can be experienced, and more creative possibilities can be explored—areas to lead with Music, or to lead with Sound Effects, and lose Music. The fine tuning never stops, but it all begins in the spotting sessions.</em><br />
<em> </em><br />
<em>Although it is a bit much to expect both Composer AND Sound Designer to sit through spotting in extreme detail together (due to the amount of time required), the process is invaluable for exchanging concepts, and game planning. Discussion can evolve during a spotting session such as this, so that all present can &#8220;plead their cases&#8221; with the director. Maybe for comedies, this would be less of a factor, but certainly it is helpful for action films.  We can save the discussion of how LOUD music is played for another day! Many times, unfortunately, the temp dub serves as the &#8216;spotting&#8217;. Decisions are made to get the early versions done, and then &#8216;temp love&#8217; sets in.</em><em><br />
</em><br />
<em>While George has not seen this process work on every film, he again stressed the PEOPLE aspect. The more open discussion there is, the better the final product will be.</em></p></blockquote>
<h2><em></em>GARY RYDSTROM</h2>
<p><strong><em>Sound Designer and Supervising Sound Editor</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>(Saving Private Ryan, Finding Nemo, Minority Report)</em></strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em></em></strong>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any cons to spotting with the Composer and Director. Too often, the composer and sound supervisors don&#8217;t get to sit together and hear what the director is thinking. Together, the composer and sound supervisors can help work out where score should be, where it should start and stop, where the music should carry the weight of a moment, and when FX can. They can hear what each other is thinking in terms of types of sounds, frequencies, orchestration. They can point out potential conflicts.</p>
<p>In my experience, I like sitting in on the music spotting. A separate FX spotting would happen, and I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d want to subject the composer to that! On &#8220;Backdraft&#8221;, we had Hans Zimmer&#8217;s full-sounding mockups of the score available before we cut SFX, and it helped up make and pick sounds that worked with the music. Conversely, on &#8220;Jurassic Park,&#8221; I played early takes of the SFX for John Williams, and he was able to orchestrate the music, to some small extent, with the pitches of our FX in mind.</p>
<p>The most perfect blend of music and FX I experienced was on &#8220;A.I.&#8221; and &#8220;Punch-Drunk Love.&#8221; &#8220;A.I&#8221; was scored by John Williams early enough that we had the final score to cut SFX against—that allowed us to use tonal, overtly musical sound SFX and blend them into the score. For &#8220;Punch-Drunk Love,&#8221; Paul Thomas Anderson wanted a seamless blend of SFX and music, so we shared sounds with composer Jon Brion—he even used bits of production sounds and dialogue as part of the score.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of a film for which communication between the music and FX departments wouldn&#8217;t greatly help the mix. Things always change, but in my experience, an early collaboration helps smooth the final mix, and results in a more emotional track. These days, sharing is easier than ever. No excuses for not sharing. Always good to meet in person and discuss approaches, but after that, or in place of that, sending music and sounds back and forth is incredibly inspiring for both the composer and sound people.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>—</p>
<p>In conclusion—Ah, if Sound People could run the world&#8230;it sounds like we have some potential answers to help world peace! These issues are some of the toughest we face in the sound community. Sorting through all the possibilities, being respectful of the talented artists around us, and doing the right thing for the film. It appears to me that there is a common thread and desire for collaboration throughout all these insights. And again, the people skills we need to have in our business pay off in spades when it comes to the creative process.</p>
<p>In my world of post-production re-recording, I would love to be able to have more access to the spotting sessions. All too often we are the last to be involved in the process, and we play &#8216;catch up&#8217;. The discussions about concept and creative ideas are invaluable to the final product, as we have seen. We, as mixers, need to adapt quickly and accurately to get onboard with everyone else, as well as to offer our own input. We don&#8217;t &#8220;paint by numbers&#8221;!</p>
<p>This is why I try to make it to spotting sessions and scoring sessions. At the very least, I try to meet with the Sound Designer, Composer and/or Music Editor as early as is practical. The Temp Mix is where the Mixers have been &#8216;traditionally&#8217; brought in to the creative process. It has proven to be invaluable for solidifying the team, adding insight, fine tuning and experimenting. Temps are not as prevalent as they once were, mostly due to financial concerns, and THIS is yet another topic for us to look at!</p>
<p>So, we must constantly strive to evolve and adapt; re-inventing ourselves and the ways in which we work. Not a bad thing, really, in the end. Most times, we don&#8217;t have any control over who we work with on a project, and people from all corners are thrust together for several months to become a team. We owe it to our directors to keep our eye on the ball, and be true to our craft.</p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone who participated in this topic. It is encouraging to me to see so many (busy) people willing to find ways to improve the process, but also, to discuss solid methods of working, and learn a few things from each other along the way.</p>
<p>COMMENTS are open below this article. Add your insight, and participate in this talk. It can only lead to better movies!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The content in a film.. the footage in between the ins and the outs of the spot —What the cue is trying to achieve, and how should we approach that in a spotting session—is fairly simple, as long as you&#8217;re following a few guidelines. It&#8217;s not easy—you&#8217;re expected to be handing a number of different dynamics during a spotting session, after all—but it <em>is</em> simple.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d start with this: <strong>Focus the conversation on dramatic needs.</strong> You want to avoid loading up on musical terminology pretty much throughout your collaboration, but more so than ever during spotting. Because you haven&#8217;t written anything yet, now&#8217;s the time when it&#8217;s most tempting to try to explain what your ideas are by using musical language.</p>
<p>Resist. Not only does it threaten to alienate your collaborators, it also hems you in unnecessarily. Keep the conversation focused, as much as possible, on what the music should be trying to achieve.</p>
<p>Next up: <strong>Consider alternate approaches</strong>. Here I&#8217;m speaking in terms of the highest-level conceptual approach to a scene. You can score a scene <em>entirely viscerally</em> (&#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mousing">Mickey-mousing</a>&#8216; being the obvious example); at such a remove that you&#8217;re actually <em>playing against scene;</em> or somewhere in between (music that reflects the character&#8217;s state of mind, for example, or that speaks to the larger dramatic situation that is unfolding rather than simply reacting to actions).</p>
<p>Keeping this entire spectrum of possible approaches in your mind allows cool and original ideas to present themselves to you. Especially when there&#8217;s an easy, obvious way to come at a scene, you might want to step back mentally for a moment and consider: what if I did the Other Thing here? It takes a certain presence of mind to do, and that comes with practice—but a certain, deliberate, willful sort of practice.</p>
<p>For me, it&#8217;s a similar mental muscle to the one I exercise when I&#8217;m watching a picture on TV while continuously focusing on only the music. It&#8217;s not difficult, exactly, but easy to lose focus and let important moments slide by unremarked.</p>
<p>Also, you&#8217;ll need to <strong>address filmmaker requests</strong>. This one is probably the most important thing you&#8217;ll do, for a number of reasons. If the director wants a certain approach that you&#8217;re absolutely convinced is wrong… the spotting session is likely the place where that&#8217;s gonna come to light. If you&#8217;re going to be pressed harder and harder just to copy the temp, you&#8217;ll find that out (or your initial impression will be confirmed) at the spotting session. And so on.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to make it sound like too much gloom and doom here, though: there are also <em>great</em> ideas that filmmakers bring to the spotting session. Things you might not even have considered. After all, these people have been present throughout the project&#8217;s gestation, and they may even have built a scene or two with a specific musical effect in mind.</p>
<p>Bottom line on this one: you&#8217;re going to have to take up the issue of specific filmmaker ideas, requests and even <em>demands</em> pretty much every time out. Yes, they cut into your domain. Yes, they can torpedo your carefully-considered approach. Yes, sometimes it sounds like the filmmakers weren&#8217;t even listening to your prepared speech at the outset, selling your concept for the score.</p>
<p>If the approach is workable, if the ideas they&#8217;re bringing are something you can live with at all, I suggest you hang in there, make your argument without being a pest about it, and get about the business of trying to orient yourself to whatever it is they&#8217;re suggesting. If only to understand why another creative human being would prefer that choice. Think of it as a way to expand your own <a href="../../../2009/09/weekend-provocation-locus-of-cool.html">locus of cool</a>, if nothing else.</p>
<p>See? All pretty simple stuff. Not easy, but simple. I want to hear what you think on this one… I know there&#8217;s more to be discussed here, so consider this Weekend Provocation article a stub (Wikipedia-style) that we can all add to in the discussion, below.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>What started out as an article about the role of assistants in the spotting process turned out to be a little more than that. I&#8217;ll cover some aspects of spotting from a composer assistant&#8217;s perspective, but you&#8217;ll find more of an overarching description about what assistants should and shouldn&#8217;t do overall in this particular column. End disclaimer.</p></blockquote>
<p>When you assist a composer, which I have spent the majority of my time in LA doing, it&#8217;s hard to get excited about the &#8220;spotting session&#8221;. It is only on Spotting Day that I know several things are about to take place for me: I&#8217;m going to be fetching a hell of a lot of coffee and I&#8217;m going to repeating the phrase, &#8220;Can I get you anything else?&#8221; a whole helluva lot, too.</p>
<p>Oh yes… as an assistant, Spotting Day is all about making people comfortable. You are responsible for setting up the room, getting the refreshments prepared and arranged, making sure the equipment is working properly, and a whole host of other boredom-inducing tasks that will literally make you wish upon a star that you were at home in your bathrobe… pulling your fingernails out one by one.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s if you aren&#8217;t paying attention.</p>
<p>If you are a learner, you will find your composer&#8217;s spotting sessions to be of great educational value now as the assistant, but especially later as you move on to develop your own business and start to make inroads as an independent composer. The things I&#8217;ve learned while watching my composers (and their teams) spot films are some of the best lessons in cinema one could ever ask for. You&#8217;ve undoubtedly heard it said many times, but &#8220;there&#8217;s nothing better than being there&#8221;.</p>
<h1>Gatekeeper</h1>
<p>When I&#8217;ve sat in on spotting sessions, my job has been to be the <em>gatekeeper</em> for my composer. If the spotting session is happening at the composer&#8217;s studio, it is very important that there is someone who is running interference by eliminating any and all unnecessary distractions. For the composer, keeping everyone&#8217;s focus on the task of agreeing on the places where the music will go is the most important part of the process at this juncture and will set up the way that this project will go from here on. If the director is uncomfortable in his chair, the editor is looking around for something cold to drink, and the music editor is worried that his parking meter is going to run over out on the street in front of the studio, then your composer is the only one truly watching to see where music should go, and that, as we know, is a recipe for disaster. Not because a composer couldn&#8217;t spot the thing himself, but only because we&#8217;ve all been in the place where the composer decides where a musical statement should be only to have the director change it all at the last minute. Had he not been distracted at the session, chances are slimmer that a change would need to be made later.</p>
<p>If you assist, this is the time when you are going to want to try and anticipate when and where people are going to feel like they need to take their attention off of the spotting and put it onto something else entirely. The absolute focus of the director, editor, composer, sound designer, and music editor is key in this process or mistakes will be made. You must do everything you can do to keep the attention on the film. I used to keep a roll of quarters in my desk at a studio I worked at for while so that I could go feed parking meters and make sure that when the director came out to get his car, it wasn&#8217;t sitting on the bed of a tow truck. These are the kind of things that you are supposed to be thinking about when you assist a composer during a spotting session.</p>
<h1>Environmental Inspector</h1>
<p><strong></strong>Another part of your job as an assistant during a spotting session is to anticipate and correct technical errors. Is the picture not showing up? Is there audio coming out of the speakers? What is that hum that you are hearing? I promise you, when you get a room full of important people together to watch a movie and your composer is feeling the stress of the meeting, anything that can go wrong WILL go wrong! It&#8217;s Murphy&#8217;s Law. Make sure that you fully test everything prior to the spotting session. There is nothing more embarrassing, for you or your composer, than to have people sitting there ready work without the ability to do so simply because nobody checked the cable connections or the picture before the session started.</p>
<p>In my experience, it has been the simplest things that have ruined entire spotting sessions. One time, I was working as an intern at a studio in Santa Monica. The guy who was actually assisting the composer at this spotting session had plugged in a power strip to wire everything up with. As the attendees took their seats, I could not help but notice from the back of the room that the cord for that power strip was left running out into the middle of the room, in perfect placement for someone to come along and trip on it. I mentioned it to the assistant, and he casually brushed me off and told me not to worry about it. Sure enough, about 30 minutes into the film, the director called a break and asked the composer where the restroom was. He headed off in that direction, turning back quickly to look for his cell phone. As he whirled around to head again to the restroom, he tripped over that cable and almost ate it headfirst into a glass coffee table. Very embarrassed and also visibly upset, the director stumbled into the hallway and down towards the restroom.</p>
<p>What returned was a very pissed off and annoyed director monster. From that moment on, he didn&#8217;t like a single idea the composer came up with, and actually begun to side very publicly with the film&#8217;s editor on almost all music placement decisions.</p>
<p>You never know what is going to change the vibe in the room. It could be an idea that is not given credence, a chair that the someone finds uncomfortable, the soda that is being supplied is not what anybody likes to drink, or someone leaves a cord plugged in where people can easily trip and fall.</p>
<p>The lesson here is to make sure that people are positioned in such a manner that all ideas presented can be heard and discussed without physical discomfort, provide comfortable seating, make a phone call to the director&#8217;s assistant and find out what he/she likes to drink, and run cables where people can&#8217;t get hurt.</p>
<p>Pretty simple.</p>
<h1>Welcome Wagoneer</h1>
<p><strong></strong>On the first film I worked on as SCOREcast founder Deane Ogden&#8217;s assistant, we were prepping for a simple spotting session at Deane&#8217;s studio with the director, the editor, and the executive producer. As conversation pieces, Deane keeps a lot of gadgets and goofy toys in his studio—things like Slinkies, PEZ dispensers, and miniature rock gardens. Throughout the spotting session, the director of that film kept fiddling with the Maharajah PEZ dispenser that Deane keeps on the upper tier of his workstation desk. Deane and the director disagreed many times during the spotting session, and decided to table a few particular places until Deane had a chance to really go through the film a few times and play with themes. But all the while, the director kept monkeying around with that PEZ dispenser, flipping its head back and forth and holding onto it for all dear life, as if it gave him some sense of security that everything would be okay&#8230; if we could just get through this spotting session! Once or twice, I caught Deane&#8217;s eye and we both silently acknowledged that we noticed the directors fascination with the toy.</p>
<p>After the spotting session was over, Deane had me make a call over to the director&#8217;s office at the production company and find out what their mailing address was.</p>
<p>Two days later, Deane received an elated call from the director saying what a wonderful surprise it was to open a package in his office to find that PEZ dispenser wrapped up with a card. After that day, Deane and that director saw eye to eye on virtually every other issue that came up during the scoring of that film, and the process of delivery was flawless and event-free.</p>
<p>As an assistant, you are the musical equivalent to the town Welcome Wagon. You can be a good assistant by just showing up everyday and doing your job—humping cable, cutting demos, installing software—or you can be a <em>great</em> assistant by noticing the things that might make your composer&#8217;s relationship with his/her director better and more relaxed.</p>
<p>Do some research and find out about what the people in your room are into. Do they like a certain band or artist? Send them an iTunes gift card before the spotting session. It really doesn&#8217;t matter what it is, just as long as it is something that you know they will really be in love with. Sending them something non-personal will have the opposite affect and will not make them feel welcomed into your composer&#8217;s circle of trust. Also, you don&#8217;t need to send a gift. That is simply only one example of something my composer did at one time that happened to work in our favor. You might want to just familiarize yourself with anything that these people have been involved in recently so that you can make conversation with them on common ground. You could apply this tip to any point in time with one of your principals. It doesn&#8217;t just pertain to spotting time.</p>
<p>These are just three of the little things I try to do as an assistant for my composers in or around the time we are spotting a film. To all of you assistants out there who have better and more specific ideas as to how we can better prepare our composers for a winning spot, <strong>COMMENTS</strong> are open.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[There are all kinds of things besides <i>spotting</i> that make a spotting session important. After the jump, some discussion: what they are, why they're important, and how to turn them to your advantage. (And yes, I did make a special green logo for St. Patrick's Day. You're worth it.)]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="../../../2010/03/17/lee-sanders-everything-but-spotting/sig-sanders-2" rel="attachment wp-att-446"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-446" title="sig-sanders" alt="" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sig-sanders.jpg" width="136" height="136" /></a>The spotting session is usually the first time you&#8217;re actually <em>working</em> together with the filmmakers on the project. Up to this point you&#8217;ve probably talked a bit about how your score might function with the picture. You have at least the broad strokes of the music budget in place, so you know what kind of forces you&#8217;ll be able to bring to bear on the scoring enterprise.</div>
<div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>But now you&#8217;re all together in the room, looking at the picture… deciding on the precise frames where music will enter and exit… and what that music will attempt to accomplish within the scene. You&#8217;re <em>working</em>.</p>
<p>And yet there are other things taking place that will set the stage for how this project&#8217;s gonna go.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>First, you&#8217;re establishing a work dynamic with the filmmakers.</strong> Are they constantly running out of the room to take calls? Then they&#8217;ll continue that in playback meetings and so on, all the way through the dub. Are they trying to micromanage your music? That&#8217;ll only get worse as the project continues. Are they running late? Did you have to re-schedule the session more than once? All these are red flags that you should heed. Not that I&#8217;m advising that any one of them is a reason to walk away—but each is something to note and to prepare for in the future.</p>
<p>By the way, I&#8217;m mentioning causes for concern so far, but I should also point out some other, more heartening indicators that you might notice at the spotting session: things like verbalizing trust; being willing to slow down and discuss crucial scenes at a reasonable length; and—depending on your tolerance for it—an openness to having spirited, respectful and cheerful arguments. To me that last one makes for some of the most compelling moments in the entire process, and I&#8217;m always excited when a filmmaker brings up a viewpoint or an approach that I hadn&#8217;t anticipated.</p>
<p>One last thing: all of what I&#8217;m talking about here cuts both ways. If you&#8217;re relegated to bringing the filmmakers coffee, scribbling notes on every scene, running the playback machine and the like, you&#8217;ve relegated yourself to a certain position of subservience. If you&#8217;re ten minutes late to the session, you&#8217;re likely to be seen as a flake or a troublemaker right from the outset.</p>
<p>Just as you&#8217;re sizing up the filmmakers, they, too, are evaluating you.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Next, you&#8217;re committing yourself to a certain timeline and a certain approach.</strong> During the spotting session, filmmakers often want to hear a detailed description of the score you&#8217;re eventually going to deliver. After all, they&#8217;re paying you, right? If you were building them a house, they&#8217;d want to take a look at the blueprints as early as possible.</p>
<p>Prior to the spotting session, every possible musical approach is potential grist for your mill. This is the moment where whole huge stylistic and narrative categories start getting thrown aside. Most of them are easy and obvious discards.</p>
<p>But the process of choosing ins and outs and goals will also end up excluding approaches that might work, if only (…you didn&#8217;t have to come in so quickly on that cut; …you were allowed to score more under the dialog; …the producer wasn&#8217;t dead-set on putting his cousin&#8217;s roommate&#8217;s band&#8217;s latest song over the final scene of the picture).</p>
<p>I can often feel the creative window narrowing as I get further and further into a spotting session. Usually, but not always, this is a good and necessary thing. Regardless, it&#8217;s something to pay attention to. If you find the choices zeroing in on some approach you don&#8217;t like or can&#8217;t execute, you need to be aware of what is happening so you can start addressing the problem.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Sometimes, you&#8217;re even choosing sides.</strong> Not every production is a honeymoon. Deep, fundamental creative differences and/or personality conflicts may exist among the members of the filmmaking team even this late in the game—and it&#8217;s not uncommon for a composer to get dragged into those battles.</p>
<p>What <em>is</em> uncommon is for filmmakers to tell the composer that a disagreement even exists. Which means you&#8217;ll need to interpret the expressions and non-verbal language of everyone in the room to navigate any potential minefields. Basically, the better you can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_reading">cold-read</a> your collaborators, the more intuitive you&#8217;ll seem as you weave your way through the meeting.</p>
<p>So… how best to handle these non-technical aspects of spotting?<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Prepare like a maniac.</strong> Really, did you think I&#8217;d start this part any other way? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Some composers love to read the script beforehand; others prefer their first exposure to the material to come in the form of a locked picture. Many fall somewhere in between. Regardless of your own preference, you should watch the most recent version of the picture that is available, and you should watch it as many times as practical.Walking into a spotting session unprepared is a disservice to the filmmakers, but even more so to yourself. Some of the best, most interesting ideas you&#8217;ll come up with for tackling the score will occur to you only after the film has &#8216;settled in&#8217; to your brain. Like any creative person, you need at least a little time for those ideas to gestate and develop… and if they haven&#8217;t done so by the time the spotting session rolls around, you&#8217;ll be hard pressed to sell them later. Changing what everyone&#8217;s finally agreed to? Not where you want to be.</p>
<p>Know the material. Develop your opinions. Consider alternate approaches. And more than all of this: <em>Anticipate</em> what the filmmakers will suggest. Which of your ideas are they most likely to support and/or object to? What new ideas might they spring on you? What are you going to have to fight for, and what should come easily?</p>
<p>Think of it like you&#8217;d think of a Presidential debate. Run your sales pitch for each cue (and non-cue!) by your assistant or a colleague. Practice speaking succinctly and eloquently about film music and about this score in particular.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Venue and Personnel.</strong> Where will the spotting session take place? Who&#8217;s allowed to be there? Whose schedule is best accommodated? Many composers like the home-field advantage of spotting at their own facility; in fact, most of my own spotting sessions happen this way. I like it because I can make sure my assistant is there to run the playback machine, take detailed notes, grab drink refills, etc. This puts me in the position of being able to direct my attention to the conversation I&#8217;m having with the filmmakers… a conversation that will influence the next few weeks or even months of my life.</p>
<p>Home-field advantage also gives me the ability to control the variables of mood and seating arrangement.   This is one of my pet peeves—people just don&#8217;t give any thought to re-arranging their room setup to accommodate a spotting session (instead of the usual writing sessions). Imagine yourself in the room with the filmmakers. Wouldn&#8217;t it be best for you to be among them, seated at a similar distance to them as they are to each other? (How far that distance <em>is</em>, by the way, is something you might also want to consider).</p>
<p>I even consider the angles at which the chairs are arranged—straight-on is too confrontational for me. Too corporate. And side-by-side, all facing the screen, makes talking (over one&#8217;s shoulder) uncomfortable. I go for a loose-ish grouping, roughly facing the screen, but positioned so that it&#8217;s also easy to pivot an inch or two to talk to the other people sitting there without craning your neck.</p>
<p>This might all sound ridiculously specific and over-planned, but over the course of a long meeting I&#8217;ve found that these things make a noticeable difference in people&#8217;s comfort level.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div style="text-align: left;">By the way… your writing room is only one place this session might occur. I&#8217;ve had wonderful spotting sessions where we simply hung out in my living room, far away from the keyboards and the computers (and the attendant pressure to, you know, <em>play them something</em> right away).There&#8217;s no rule that says you have to spot in your studio space. If you need to do so, you can always adjourn, take a little break, and go in there. On the other hand, if your studio is where you&#8217;re all likely to be most comfortable, go ahead and do the meeting there.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that this is all subject to re-evaluation based on your relationship with the filmmakers. My bottom line here: control all the variables you can think of, beforehand, when time is relatively cheap. Do what works for you… but give the matter some thought.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Focus.</strong> So simple to say; so difficult to do. Having your own team on hand to take care of the scribing and the logistical details (lunch, coffee, parking meters, etc.) helps, as I&#8217;ve said above, but there are still multiple layers of activities happening during a spotting session. Some are creative, some are political, some are logistical, some are psychological… and so on. You want to cultivate the ability to be in the moment, relaxed and attentive, rather than scattered and anxious to make your case.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve followed steps 1 and 2 above, you&#8217;ve gone a long way toward maximizing your ability to tune out the extraneous details. Now it&#8217;s time to tune in the important ones. This is another of those inner-game skills that nearly every successful composer I know does <em>well</em>. They know how to engage. Their conversation flows without being forced, without fear of silence, and you never get the sense that they&#8217;re going to slap their forehead later that night and say, &#8220;Ah! <em>That</em> was how I should&#8217;ve handled that.&#8221;</p>
<p>We can be like those guys… but it takes practice and preparation. And <em>focus</em>.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Slow it down.</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div style="text-align: left;">One way to make the job of focusing a little easier is to avoid rushing through the session. It&#8217;s a long meeting, and somewhere in the back half of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenwriting#Three_act_structure">second act</a>, you&#8217;re going to want to start picking up the pace. The phrase &#8220;We&#8217;re never gonna get this done by rush hour&#8221; might enter your mind.Resist this temptation. Take a little break if you have to (this also works well if the discussions are getting heated due to creative disagreements). And if you&#8217;re taking a break, really take one: don&#8217;t just start talking about the project again in another room.</p>
<p>Then, when you re-engage, you should be able to re-focus and resume the kind of careful, methodical discourse with which you began the session.</p>
<p>One final point here: some people have suggested spotting projects (especially feature-length projects) over a couple of sessions. I&#8217;m inclined against this, mostly because it&#8217;s hard enough to get everyone together once, much less multiple times, for this meeting! Also, of course, you tend to lose the thread of where you were in the prior meeting. The spotting is thus at risk of losing coherence. Finally, it devalues the importance of the spotting to stretch out the process, subordinate it to some other schedule demand, or simply allow your own lack of focus to result in multiple attempts to get it done. It&#8217;s not something simply to &#8220;get done.&#8221; If you have to, you have to… but I&#8217;d advise that you fight to get it &#8220;done in one.&#8221;<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Push-Pull; or, Don&#8217;t Kick the Can Down the Road.</strong></p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">As I alluded to earlier, and as Deane discussed in greater depth <a href="../../../2010/03/deane-ogden-politics-of-room.html">yesterday</a>, there&#8217;s a certain political dance taking place during a spotting session. Filmmakers may be trying to enlist you as an unwitting partisan for their &#8220;side&#8221; of a dispute that&#8217;s been brewing for weeks, months or even longer. Sometimes they&#8217;ll be up-front about this, telling you frankly that they&#8217;re at odds over this particular aspect of the picture. More often, however, they&#8217;ll try to drill down for your own opinion—even asking for musical specifics (see above).Here&#8217;s my advice on this one: wait until the playback meetings to enter into musical details. Spotting sessions should be about high-level approach… even if you&#8217;re already hearing the idea in your head and could easily play it for the filmmakers.</p>
<p>In my experience it&#8217;s best to restrict your spotting comments to dramatic notes rather than musical ones. Hearing the musical specifics is what playback meetings are for. The spotting session is too early for you to have to defend music you haven&#8217;t even written yet, so don&#8217;t get suckered into this trap.</p>
<p>Likewise, this helps you to remain as neutral as possible, for as long as possible. Which gives you time to suss out any simmering political disputes that may be happening (and decide how you want to position yourself with regards to them). Plus, it&#8217;s another subtle way in which you establish your own &#8220;weight&#8221; as a core member of the creative team. Rather than dancing on command, you&#8217;re asserting your own right to take a bit of time with the process… which implies that the process is weighty enough, important enough, that it <em>deserves</em> the expenditure of time.</p>
<p>See what I mean? It&#8217;s a way of framing your own role. Extend that frame (&#8220;I&#8217;m a highest-level collaborator; my time and input is integral to the picture&#8221;) to every aspect of the process, including spotting, and you&#8217;ve given yourself perhaps the greatest possible job security.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you don&#8217;t want to push important <em>spotting</em> decisions down the road. There&#8217;s often a tendency to take the position of &#8220;let&#8217;s see how this works once we get into it,&#8221; and some of that might even be inevitable—especially these days, when you&#8217;re often spotting a work in progress (and a final cut might not be available even by the time of the recording session!).</p>
<p>But kicking the can down the road means you&#8217;ll have to keep track of that &#8220;can&#8221; all along the way… and keeping track of too many of these cans turns into a full-time occupation in and of itself. It messes up your version control (&#8220;did I already do this cue for this version of the cut, in both the way I wanted to spot it and the way the director wanted it done? Dunno… I think I&#8217;ll just wing it.&#8221; Ouch.), and it takes time and mental energy away from Job #1: writing kick-ass cues. Be as definitive as possible with regard to spotting decisions now and you&#8217;ll save yourself a lot of heartache later.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Listen for buzzwords.</strong> This one was a huge tip for me, courtesy of Richard Bellis. His thinking runs as follows: The filmmakers in the room have been living with the project for months. They&#8217;ve already talked it over from every conceivable angle, probably <em>including</em> music. Over the course of those talks, which you probably haven&#8217;t been privy to, a certain vocabulary has developed. A certain shorthand of buzzwords and talking points that the filmmakers are using to describe the important dramatic moments, themes, etc. of the story.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Listening for those, and incorporating them into your own discourse (in a non-parroting way!), will help you communicate effectively throughout your tenure on the project. It will also bring you one step closer to being &#8220;in the club&#8221; of decision-makers, rather than feeling like the project newcomer that, from their perspective, you are.Side note: while buzzwords are often employed as thematic shorthand, or as a creative goal of the project, they&#8217;re not always a good thing. Sometimes these buzzwords are used as pre-emptive rationalizations. They&#8217;re part of the defensive rhetoric the filmmakers are beginning to erect around some perceived flaw in their picture. I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve listened to filmmaker commentaries on DVDs, and the following happened: Just when I got to a part of the movie I always thought was particularly weak, the filmmakers get very strident and over-enthusiastic about <em>exactly that thing:</em></p>
<p>Buzzword buzzword buzzword false praise for mediocrity; buzzword buzzword we&#8217;re actually glad we didn&#8217;t get too much coverage during that scene; buzzword buzzword I actually think this actor&#8217;s performance is one of the best I&#8217;ve ever had the privilege to encounter, buzzword buzzword and of course that lighting is intentional, you&#8217;re not <em>supposed</em> to be able to see the bad guy get killed at the end, anyone who doesn&#8217;t get that is missing the buzzword buzzword.</p>
<p>On some level they know it&#8217;s a problem, and their answer is to talk up the weakness as though it were a strength. You see this kind of thing in politics all the time, of course—and this is politics, too, of a sort.</p>
<p>If you think you&#8217;re up against defensive buzzwords (a.k.a. desperation-time spin), my advice is not to buck the trend. Simply say nothing. If you&#8217;re asked what you think of [that lighting; this actor&#8217;s line-read; etc.], answer a question with a question: &#8220;Were you looking for something different?&#8221; Then listen. Chances are you&#8217;ll either get a real explanation (in which case you might—might!—be able to help out with music), or you&#8217;ll get an innocent look and a backpedal (in which case you proceed as though nothing happened). Anyone with a better jujitsu move here, please let me know.</p>
<p>You knew that a spotting session was more than simply picking start points and end points before you started reading this. And, long as this column is, it&#8217;s only scratching the surface of the nuances. If anything, I hope you now feel <em>prepared</em> to get into that room and excel at the process—aware of the likely pitfalls and some steps to circumvent them.</p>
<p>I also hope you feel <em>authorized</em> to spend the time and energy necessary to do this meeting right. Because the truth is this: it&#8217;s easy just to wing your way through a spotting session. You can skip the seating arrangement… you can be extremely passive… you can make obvious technical choices… you can agree with whatever the filmmakers suggest. But my view is that, by doing so, you&#8217;re really not holding up your end of the bargain.</p>
<p>Due diligence to all the aspects of a spotting session that <em>surround</em> the core mechanical and creative decisions will allow you to present the opinions that are, in fact (and yes, I&#8217;m hammering this home <em>again</em>!), the reason you&#8217;re being hired in the first place.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sig-olszewski.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-557" title="sig-olszewski" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sig-olszewski.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>A few months ago I composed the score for my first film, a documentary called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1490004/">To Be One.</a> This was a small project with a tiny budget, a flexible schedule, and an easygoing independent director. This suited me fine though, because I didn’t really have much of an idea of how to proceed. But SCOREcast&#8217;s Deane Ogden, Lee Sanders, and Brian Satterwhite helped me along the journey.</p>
<p>More of the experience, and a tool to share&#8230; after the jump!<br />
<a name="more"></a><br />
The film was divided into three segments, each with a different composer. I wrote about 20 minutes of music for my 20-minute segment. Yes, wall-to-wall music. My director was in California and I’m in Texas, so we spent plenty of time on Skype. I hooked up my system to funnel the main audio out from my equipment into Skype, which allowed us to collaborate easily, as if he were in the chair next to me.</p>
<p>Because of the informality of the project (and my inexperience), our Skype sessions amounted to ongoing spotting and tweaks until I had enough to continue working for a few hours, at which point we would get off Skype and I’d work until I had more to show him.</p>
<p>To help with this ongoing communication (and because I was on a flip-flop budget — no shoestrings), I developed a cue sheet in Excel. For a DIY Studio, a free solution is a great one, just so it fills the need — and it did nicely. The cue sheet allowed us to speak in more exact terms, and was a great way to maintain and communicate our spotting decisions.</p>
<p>In the spirit of no-cost solutions, I’d like to offer up my cue sheet for comment, corrections, enhancements, and yes, feel free to steal it. It won’t be useful to everyone, but it may be useful to some. Most of the project-specific information has been removed from the template, but I left some in for illustrative purposes.</p>
<p>The first tab of the spreadsheet (“ProjectInfo”) is just project information and various codes used throughout the spreadsheet. The Project Title, Composer, and FPS fields are propagated through the other tabs.</p>
<p><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5446068021574855186" style="display: block; height: 277px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_P3p3I805INU/S5RSAtiVahI/AAAAAAAAADQ/-BkD1s8nDbc/s320/201003_DIY1.PNG" border="0" alt="" /> The second tab (“CueSheet”) shows the cues for the segment, with each cue’s start and stop SMPTE codes. The SMTPE code computation is perhaps a bit inelegant, with the Frame field separated from the SMPTE In and SMPTE Out fields; but based on the frame rate set in the first tab, this was the easiest way to make the math work.</p>
<p><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5446068310118655906" style="display: block; height: 225px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 491px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_P3p3I805INU/S5RSRgciZ6I/AAAAAAAAADY/ewFLEcqOdeM/s320/201003_DIY2.PNG" border="0" alt="" /> The third tab (“TimingSheet”) breaks down the cues further, allowing the director and I to note specific needs/changes within each cue. The grey row you see below represents a space in the film without any music. In this case, it was about 6 seconds of silence.</p>
<p><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5446068606515450146" style="display: block; height: 233px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 439px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_P3p3I805INU/S5RSiwnCkSI/AAAAAAAAADg/_pyh_aouDrM/s320/201003_DIY3.PNG" border="0" alt="" />In all of the spreadsheets, the orange fields are formulas of some kind, copying information from sheet to sheet, calculating durations, and validating frame rates (for example, if I tell the spreadsheet the project runs at 30fps and I accidentally type in that a particular scene begins on frame 33, the validation column throws an error.<br />
Yes, it’s simple — even crude — but it’s better than nothing, which is what I had! But the spreadsheet assisted greatly in spotting sessions with my director, kept me on schedule, and kept my director happy.</p>
<p>I’m open for critique, edits, improvements, etc&#8230; and if you have a great no-cost or low-cost solution, talk it up! We DIYers would love to see what else is out there. Here is the <a href="http://files.me.com/deaneogdenmusic1/jjaot3">link</a> to the actual spreadsheet. Enjoy!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Creative Process. It&#8217;s a tough thing to talk about for me because my creative process (CP) is in such a constant state of flux all of the time. From project to project, my CP changes up drastically. And then sometimes, what worked on one project also works great on the next.</p>
<p>What I will offer today is a sneak peek into the creative habits of some of the composers that I&#8217;ve worked with over the few years that I&#8217;ve been assisting. From these great composers, I&#8217;ve gleaned many secrets, tricks, templates, skills, and techniques &#8211; some that I use in my own work, and others that I don&#8217;t, but might someday. The thing that I&#8217;ve always noticed about each composer though, no matter who they were or what they were working on, is that these tricks and secrets were really &#8220;habitual&#8221; in their work flows. These are things that they do EVERY time they sit down to conceptualize or write through a film score. And I believe that is the key to the whole thing. You need to develop &#8220;habits&#8221; that will invite the Muse to the right time and place for a creative collision.</p>
<p>Since these are from different composers, I will present some here in no particular order. Hopefully, you&#8217;ll find one or two of these habits (or all of them if you are just getting going) useful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>The Overture Blueprint</h1>
<p>Several composers I&#8217;ve worked for use this principle as an overarching guide to how they score a film. They&#8217;ll watch the film many times (and I mean MANY times; sometimes in upwards of thirty of forty viewings), and then they&#8217;ll sit down at the piano or guitar and write an &#8220;overture&#8221;.</p>
<p>In traditional terms, an overture is a piece of music that &#8220;comes before&#8221; or &#8220;precedes&#8221; something else. A typical example would be the music the symphony plays before the opera starts. But inherent in almost every overture are the main themes of the opera or of the piece that follows the overture. The overture is sort of a large format rendering of every main theme within the whole work and addresses each theme with as much fullness and bravado that can be pulled from it &#8211; a fully fleshed out thematic linear string. Each theme and motif is represented in the overture. Upon completing the overture, the composer then has a veritable blueprint from which he or she can create the score and work the cues around in order to not stray far from the original thoughts behind the music.</p>
<p>Many composers use or have used this method, from <a class="zem_slink" title="Jerry Goldsmith" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000025/" rel="imdb">Jerry Goldsmith</a> to <a class="zem_slink" title="John Ottman" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0653211/" rel="imdb">John Ottman</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Research and Ethnomusicology</h1>
<p>When I was at Media Ventures, I watched Hans and crew research the hell out of most films they were charged with scoring. In fact, much of the first weeks were consumed with me and my fellow interns fetching books and Web clippings about certain instruments, even to the point of sussing out the foremost experts in the fields of these instruments and asking them questions, or sometimes inviting them to play on scores. These exercises in research gave me an awareness of the breadth of our musical vocabulary that I never learned in school or in private study. Once you really dive into the process of researching, from an ethnomusicological standpoint, you will understand just how much you have to learn about global musics. Talking to those who play these instruments will also teach you how to better write for that sound, and as a composer who most likely doesn&#8217;t play that particular instrument, this is vital to the quality of your music.</p>
<h1>Templates and Maps</h1>
<p>One of the things I never can stomach in certain scores is when you are watching along and are really into the film, and then POW! Out of nowhere, a sound so AGAINST anything else in the film score whomps you upside your head, taking you out of the film completely. More often that not, you hear this on smaller, lower-budget films. And I&#8217;ll tell you why.</p>
<p>Not always, but typically, the lower the budget the less experienced the composer and director. The above problem is usually two-fold. First, the director let that choice go unchallenged, or in some cases came up with the idea himself! Secondly, the composer was working without a &#8220;template&#8221;.</p>
<p>A template can be defined here as a &#8220;DAW instrumentation map for the duration of a film score&#8221;. Essentially, you take your arrange window in your DAW and load up every articulation of every instrument that you deem necessary for the film&#8217;s score&#8230; and you DON&#8217;T DEVIATE from that template as you write your cues. This way, the entire score, from beginning to end, is cohesive and complimentary of its parts.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, nine times out of ten, this is a rookie mistake. Most seasoned pros have already learned from the consequences of this error. When a score travels outside the lines of its own conceptualization, it causes severe cinematic problems. Take some time and be thorough in setting up your templates. If you practice the method of the &#8220;Overture Blueprint&#8221;, as outlined above, you might already have the makings of your full template by the time you are finished with the overture.</p>
<h1>Sound Mining, the &#8220;Favorite Bank&#8221;, and Go-To Sounds</h1>
<p>If I had a nickel for every time I&#8217;ve seen composers sit at their desk and scroll through plugin presets with one hand while eating a carton of Chinese food with the other, I&#8217;d be a very rich man. The best composers I&#8217;ve worked with are those who know their rigs inside and out, and the only way to know what you have sitting on those precious drives is to &#8220;mine for sounds&#8221; as much as possible. One of my duties as an assistant has been to set up a &#8220;favorite bank&#8221; for my composer so that when he or she finds a killer sound that catches the ear, we can throw it into the bank and recall it later when we are looking for something interesting in a particular situation.</p>
<p>Time is precious. There is often no time on a film score schedule to sit and try to &#8220;find&#8221; the right synth patch or MIDI drum sound. You have to have it at your fingertips, or your creative flow will eventually slow to a stop. Make sure to have all of your &#8220;favorite&#8221; sounds readily accessible so that you can recall them at will when you need them the most.</p>
<p>This also goes for &#8220;go-to sounds&#8221; — those sounds that you use all of the time. These may already be in your template, but if they aren&#8217;t, you should have them in their own sampler bank so that you can get at them instantly. These days, with Kontakt 4 and Machfive being as powerful as they have become, you can pull virtually any sound into your sampler in most formats. There is no reason to not have everything loaded into your sampler in a &#8220;favorite bank&#8221; or &#8220;go-to bank&#8221;. Just do it. Trust me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As elementary as some of these things might seem, they are the habits of some of the best composers working today, and those composers are adamant that these habits be as easy to maintain as possible.</p>
<blockquote><p>But what about you? Log into the COMMENTS below and tell me what you think your Top 3 best habits are in the conceptualization phase of scoring a film. Tell me why these habits work in your particular case and why you think they are most important to you.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: inherit; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;">
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sig-ogden1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-672" title="sig-ogden" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sig-ogden1.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>On the heels of a killer column post from SCOREcast co-host Lee Sanders on Wednesday about &#8220;<a href="../../../2009/07/surviving-crunch.html">Surviving the Crunch</a>&#8220;, James Olszewski asked a very pertinent question:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote style="font-family: inherit;">
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: small;">What do you recommend to develop a passable roadmap on a compressed timeline?&#8230; I&#8217;d like to get a peek at what one of these roadmaps looks like (even if it&#8217;s just scribbles and random notes). Being the &#8220;planner&#8221; I am, I&#8217;m already thinking of some sort of template. Maybe something that takes you progressively from random notes to roadmap to spotting to cue sheet&#8230;. Does anything like that already exist?</span></p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">This is a great question, and one that could be met with as many different answers as there are composers that exercise this practice. In this post, I&#8217;m going to show you a handful of the things that I do in my work that help me achieve a cohesive plan when taking on a new set of visuals to score. Before I do that, though, let&#8217;s define a set of assumed parameters so that we can make sure we are all on the same page.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">I&#8217;m assuming that:</span></div>
<ol style="font-family: inherit;">
<li><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>You are *not* working with a <a class="zem_slink" title="Music editor (filmmaking)" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_editor_%28filmmaking%29">music editor</a>.</strong> A music editor, according to <a class="zem_slink" title="Fred Karlin" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Karlin">Fred Karlin</a>,  is the &#8220;person responsible for all physical details regarding the syncronization of the score with the picture.&#8221; In short, this person is usually involved from the outset of post-production and may be intimately involved with placing temp music into the film, recording and notating the spotting notes at a spotting session between you and the director, and finally, placing and syncronizing the recorded, mixed, and finalized score stems into the film itself for dubbing. Many of the duties handled by an independent film composer (one who is essentially doing it *all* on his/her own) would otherwise be handled by the music editor, thus taking some of the load off the shoulders of the composer and allowing him/her to focus solely on writing and recording the score.
<p></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>You don&#8217;t have a ton of time to write the score.</strong> It&#8217;s becoming pretty typical with any film, but almost certainly with an independent film, we as composers do not have a lot of time to do our jobs when the locked cut is finally handed over. There have even been times for me when I was already on the scoring stage on an indie film and here comes Mr. Director with a new cut that nobody but him and the editor knew about until&#8230; now.
<p></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>You don&#8217;t have a ton of money in the music budget.</strong> Duh! Helllooooo! Money in the post-production budget for music on an independent film? What in the hell is that?
<p></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>You have adequately immersed yourself in the material.</strong> As a competent composer, you have to develop the discipline of <em>getting under</em> the material so that you have a solid understanding of the story&#8217;s arc at a core level. Try for a second to understand the difference between &#8220;scoring <em>through</em> a film&#8221; versus simply &#8220;scoring a film&#8221;. There is a huge difference, and a lot of the difference comes from your ability to get the material into your headspace either through the script, the concept drawings or storyboards, or the locked cut. Bottom line: You must have enough of a love of the characters in your story to warrant you being trusted with them for this period of time. If you don&#8217;t care, your music will tattle on you — I promise!<br />
</span></li>

<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">So, assuming all of those — or at least one or two of them — are in place, here are some things I do when I am roadmapping a score to insure that I don&#8217;t get too far ahead of myself before realizing that I should have taken &#8220;that left toyn at Albuquerque.&#8221;</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>ORGANIZE YOUR LOGISTICS</strong><br />
Let&#8217;s first define what we are hired to do: <strong><em>Write music</em></strong>. That&#8217;s it. Nothing more, nothing less. We are the music people. However, we all know that there are way more things involved in scoring for a feature than just simply writing the music, don&#8217;t we? There are probably hundreds of little tiny nagging tasks that must be done daily in our studios in order than we might concentrate fully on writing score. I&#8217;m talking about phone calls, emails, notes, mailings, <a class="zem_slink" title="File Transfer Protocol" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">FTP</a> deliveries, invoicing, etc. Those all fall into what I would consider only one single set of administrative duties.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">The other set consists of things that are directly related to the main task of writing the music: Spotting the film; organizing spotting notes; keeping track of reel splits; scheduling live sessions; notating edit changes; interfacing with music editors, recording engineers, and mixers; and, last but certainly not least, keeping track of how much music you have left to write and how much time you have to write it in.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><em><strong>Cue Log Manager and Cue Chronicle</strong></em><br />
Luckily, there are a couple of killer software programs that can handle that entire last paragraph for you. The first one is a little number called <em><strong>Cue Log Manager (CLM)</strong></em>. CLM is a <a class="zem_slink" title="FileMaker" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileMaker">Filemaker Pro</a> database application that allows you to keep track of a film score, television score, or game score project from spotting to delivery. It was developed by Dino Herrmann and Daniel Hamuy, the team behind the popular &#8220;Powerkeys&#8221; DAW add-on.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: inherit; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"><a style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm12M4soB1I/AAAAAAAAAeE/NTPT2blbtBA/s1600-h/Picture+17.png"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm12M4soB1I/AAAAAAAAAeE/NTPT2blbtBA/s320/Picture+17.png" border="0" alt="" /></a></span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">I use CLM everyday in my studio and I like it for its clean layout, easy to understand functionality, and ability (through Filemaker) to put on a shared server and run with all of my workstations in my studio, enabling them to access to the most up-to-date info on where we are on projects. CLM features a simple layout which includes several &#8220;screensets&#8221; to work from, beginning with the Project Database. </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">The Project Database is an                  overall view of your project which enables you to track the status                  of each cue in the project. You can see if each cue has been composed,                  approved, orchestrated, recorded or which musician already recorded                  in each cue. </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">You can label your cues by usage, description, genre or style                  fields to help identify them within the project, and you can also </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">track                  multiple ensembles (orchestra, band, jazz trio, etc), as well as oversee </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">a detail view of what cues will be recorded                  in which session. The database will automatically calculate                  how many minutes of music need to be recorded per session, providing for you all of the information necessary to then organize the session more efficiently. CLM also allows                  for multiple sessions per day, as well as a great &#8220;Change                  Session Date&#8221; script that makes changing the date and time                  of a session and its related cues a snap.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><em>Cue Log Manager</em> also acts as a &#8220;Virtual Music Editor&#8221;, giving you the ability to </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">dynamically create Spotting Notes, Summary Sheets                  and Cue Sheets for your project as it evolves. The <em>spotting notes</em> feature displays start times, stop times,                  length, usage and a short description of each cue as well as length                  totals; the <em>summary sheet</em> option provides a quick overview of all                  the cues in a project and their length and usage; and the <em>cue list</em> page shows a list of each cue in a project with                  all the composer and publisher information as well as length and                  usage, serving as a worksheet for Performing                  Royalty Organizations (such as ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC) cue sheets.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><em>Cue Log Manager</em> is available for Apple computers running Filemaker Pro 8 or 9 in at least Mac OS 10.3.9. It retails online at the <a href="http://www.powerkeys.com/cuelogmanager.html">Powerkeys website</a> for $89 US.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><em><strong>Cue Chronicle</strong></em>, invented by Hollywood ProTools recordist Vincent Cirilli, is also worth taking a look at. <em>Cue Chronicle</em> differs greatly from Cue Log Manager in that it is offerred both as a Filemaker database and also as a standalone runtime application. It is also offers two unique and smart ways to license the application, which I&#8217;ll explain in a minute.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: inherit; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"><a style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm18IQ4vNkI/AAAAAAAAAeM/s0BjOd3lcT8/s1600-h/clistv3.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm18IQ4vNkI/AAAAAAAAAeM/s0BjOd3lcT8/s320/clistv3.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">Built certainly more with larger format studio scoring sessions in mind, </span><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><em>Cue Chronicle (CC)</em> is extensively more user definable than Cue Log Manager because of the way that Vinnie has created it. CC&#8217;s database is hugely modular which enables the entire app to function like a &#8220;central nervous system&#8221; for your scoring projects, including whole workspaces devoted soley to indivudual aspects of a scoring project like <em>crew</em>, <em>rigs</em>, <em>drives</em>, <em>reels</em>, <em>contacts</em>, and <em>notes</em>. The vast toolbox of checklists and itemizable charts include important variables such as version tracking, revision tracking, timing changes, takes, tracksheets for recording, and orchestral breakdown with a deep section allowing you to list and keep track of your instrumentation per cue. Everything is color-coded to make it easy to see and simple to monitor at quick glance, and with many fields user-definable, <em>Cue Chronicle</em> makes it pretty difficult to run out of ways to sort content.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;">While Cue Log Manager utilizes a simple challenge and response licensing scheme, <em>Cue Chronicle</em> gives you a choice to tether your license to a particular machine in your studio OR tether the license to a USB memory stick enabling you to travel with the license and software from studio to studio, stage to stage. Pretty handy.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-size: small;"><em>Cue Chronicle</em> is available from <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/vcirilli/CueChronicle/index.html">Vincent Cirrilli&#8217;s website</a> and is downloadable for $295 US. It runs on Apple PPC or Intel computers running OS 10.4 and higher, and the optional Filemaker Pro v8 (v9 recommended).<br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>FINDING YOUR &#8220;SPOT&#8221;</strong><br />
When I was just getting started, the biggest problem I had with scoring a film from beginning to end was knowing where the best places were to put music. I was never quite sure early on if I was placing music in the film where the music should *really* be placed, or if I was just sort of guessing as best I could with no real idea of what I was doing. It took me awhile to get really great at spotting. The big problem for me was that I had a very difficult time seeing the entire score as a representative whole from top to bottom. When I would work, I would start writing whichever cue was calling me at the time, not really paying much attention to what I was doing in terms of continuity and sequence. At the end of writing the score, I would invariably end up forgetting something in the thrid or the fourth reel and then having to go back and write what I should have remembered to do while I was there the first time! It was very hard for me to see the overall &#8220;big picture&#8221; when I was needing to be so tunnel-visioned into what I was doing.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">If you have issues with not knowing whether or not you are covering everything you need to cover in your scores, or if you are having trouble spotting things on your own, let me offer this as a tip that might help get you thinking about how spotting can help you, and not scare you. You might have seen directors use this method that I am going to describe, but I learned it from an editor that I once worked with that has been using the method of storyboarding on <em><strong>Post-It Notes</strong></em> for the vast majority of his career.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">The idea of the <em>Post-It Note Score Storyboard</em> is to take a section of a wall in your writing room (as big a section as you can part with) and use it sort of as a big huge &#8220;map&#8221; for the storyline, characters, and arc of the film in relation to the musical cues that you will write to coalese with those points on your &#8220;map&#8221;. If you&#8217;ve ever watched or seen a director storyboard a camera shot, then you already know what I am talking about. Its not so much about storyboarding the musicality of a cue as much as it is about storyboarding the cue itself in the timeline of the film&#8217;s story arc.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">Start by taking a stack of standard canary yellow Post-It Notes and writing on each note a single event in the film that you feel is pivotal. &#8220;KISS&#8221; would be the key here: Keep It Simple! On one note you might write the words, &#8220;First Day/Harry Gets Up&#8221;. Another might say, &#8220;Car Won&#8217;t Start&#8221;. Yet another might say, &#8220;Julianne Misses Her Bus&#8221;. Be <em>specific</em> and be <em>generous</em> — you can always get rid of the events that you won&#8217;t write cues for, but once you have evrything up in the timeline, it will be hard to add events without moving all of the subsequent events down the line to compensate.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: inherit; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"><a style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm2HISzz2rI/AAAAAAAAAec/blm8YqBMJoU/s1600-h/warroom09.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sm2HISzz2rI/AAAAAAAAAec/blm8YqBMJoU/s200/warroom09.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">Arrange these canary yellow &#8220;timeline&#8221; notes on the wall, left to right, in the sequence in which they occur as the film plays out. After you are finished, you should have a visual representation of the film&#8217;s timeline made up of yellow Post-It Notes.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">After you have the whole film represented with the canary yellow notes, take another stack of Post-Its that is a decidely different color from the yellow ones you just used to timeline the film. Maybe these are going to be Hot Pink. Designate these Hot Pink notes as the &#8220;cues&#8221; of your score. Take yet <em>another</em> set of a different color (green, orange, blue, purple&#8230; whatever floats your boat!) and make that your &#8220;Theme&#8221; color. Take a third set of a different color still and make these your &#8220;Motif&#8221; notes. You get the picture.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">Then, loosely decide (because I promise, you&#8217;ll change your mind about twenty million times!) where to put the hot pink CUE notes on the yellow timeline. Once that set has been exhausted, grab your THEME color and place those over the CUE notes where you think a main theme or character theme would be nice. After that, take you MOTIF color and place some of those over the THEME notes where you think your <em>Main Motif</em> might work nicley and communicate what&#8217;s happening in a scene. Pretty soon, after a lot of going back and forth, sticking and unsticking, moving and shuffling, you&#8217;ll have a fairly decent jumping-off point in which to begin scoring your new feature.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">Use this method to really experiment and try stuff you don&#8217;t think you should try! Often, those are the happiest of accidents and sometimes end up being the catalysts by which inspiration is born&#8230; and Oscars are awarded!</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">These are only a couple of ideas I have to get you thinking about your workflow and how maybe you can either make it more efficient (Cue Log Manager or Cue Chronicle) or dance outside the fire a bit with regards to how you plan your scores (Post-It Note spotting). I&#8217;d like to hear your ideas for mixing up your workflow in your studios and writing rooms&#8230;.</span></div>

Sure, it cuts a few precious syllables out of conversations… but air is cheap. So what gives?</p>
<p>I think it has to do with the feeling of being &#8220;in the loop&#8221;—that secure, clubby vibe that comes from knowing we&#8217;re among geeks of a similar stripe. TLAs and their ilk are like secret handshakes. They&#8217;re the modern-day shibboleths by which we identify our own.</p>
<p>So here are a few &#8220;secret handshakes&#8221; you&#8217;ll hear in the studio, in the editing bay and on the scoring stage.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>ADR: </span>Automated Dialog Recording (or Automatic Dialog Replacement, or one of any number of similar meanings—!). The exact meaning of the abbreviation, believe it or not, is a point of controversy in the Industry. What is agreed on is what ADR is: it&#8217;s the replacement (in post-production) of poorly recorded or performed bits of dialog or location sound. Also called <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">looping</span>.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>ASCAP</span>, <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">BMI</span>, <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">SESAC</span>: Only one of these is a true TLA (the other two are acronyms). All three are <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">PRO</span>s (see below).<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>DGA</span>: Directors Guild of America. The union for film and television directors.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>DP</span>: Director of Photography (a.k.a. cinematographer). And, of course, <a href="http://www.motu.com/products/software/dp/">Digital Performer</a>.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>EDL</span>: Edit Decision List. This is a file generated by computer-based video editing systems, containing information about all the cuts, fades, timecode locations, etc. that constitute the edit.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>FCP</span>: Final Cut Pro. Apple&#8217;s pro-level video-editing software (even though it&#8217;s now officially titled <a href="http://www.apple.com/finalcutstudio/">Final Cut Studio</a>).<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>IATSE</span>: The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees. The IATSE union represents a wide variety of people involved in the making of films: from set decorators to costumers, from grips to lighting to first aid.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>M&amp;E</span>: Music and Effects. You&#8217;ll often hear this term used when a producer is talking about foreign versions of a particular picture—even though they may be dubbing (i.e., replacing) the dialog, they don&#8217;t want to re-do their entire project mix, so they&#8217;ll create a submix containing only the music and effects… hence, M&amp;E.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>MOS</span>: Mit Out Sound. Here&#8217;s a wacky one for you. MOS derives from an old Hollywood tale about a German director asking for a scene to be shot &#8220;mit out sound,&#8221; and a snarky camera assistant who wrote M.O.S. on the slate. The name stuck. (Sound is, of course, added later.)<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>NDA</span>: Non-disclosure agreement. Depending on the type of show you&#8217;re working on, you might be asked to sign one of these confidentiality documents. You&#8217;re basically promising not to tell who wins the reality-show competition, which main character dies in the season finale, or any other privileged information. Penalties threatened by NDAs can run into the millions of dollars.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>OMF</span>: Open Media Framework. A data standard used by AVID editing systems, OMFs are typically used to transfer audio information from AVIDs to Pro Tools setups for mixing.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>OMG</span>: What you text your friends when you pick up a network series or studio picture.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>PRO</span>: Performing Rights Organization. These are the fine folks who collect and distribute royalties to composers, songwriters, lyricists, etc. Of course, they do much more than that… but it is tough to read beyond the magic word: <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">royalties</span>.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>SMPTE</span>: Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. In our world this is usually shorthand for the timecode found on work prints, but the abbreviation refers to the organization that developed the standard.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>UPM</span>: Unit Production Manager. An executive responsible for the administration of a given film (particularly budgetary expenditures associated with the production phase of filmmaking—the UPM delivers the working budget, for example, to the financiers). UPMs are part of the <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">DGA</span> (see above) union.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
<p>WGA</span>: Writers Guild of America. The union for professional writers (particularly screenwriters). Two branches here: East and West. Unlike the music scene, no lethal rivalry is known to exist between WGAw and WGAe writers.</p>
