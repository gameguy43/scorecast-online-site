<p>SCOREcast ushered in a new decade of worldwide community goodness this past January as we celebrated our 10th Anniversary with 130 of LA&#8217;s finest SCOREcasters, as well as some friends and family from around the globe, at our annual dinner in Los Angeles. All of this happened in the midst of Deane and Brian&#8217;s 15th trip to the NAMM Convention, and the boys use this episode to talk about the highlights from this year&#8217;s show. They also cover the controversy surrounding the recent Academy Awards telecast, as well as an exciting new opportunity for composers and filmmakers happening this month in Los Angeles through something called the &#8220;Helix Collective&#8221;.</p>

		<description><![CDATA["I'm just gettin' warmed up." — Col. Frank Slade]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since I put the first SCOREcast podcast up on the air. Since then, an ever-evolving group of film music creatives has steered the very idea of <a href="http://scorecastonline.com">SCOREcast</a> via a process of trial-and-error and with a blind, white-knuckle, &#8220;why the hell not?&#8221; attitude. None of that would have been possible without the steadfast commitment of our amazing community—the SCOREcast Army—as well as the incredible team of contributing writers, guests, podcast hosts, and editors that have had a hand in the creation of the SCOREcast entity. The people who have made SCOREcast what it is today include composers, engineers, orchestrators, educators, copyists, music editors, assistants, contractors, and conductors.</p>
<p>As we move into yet another incarnation of the website, the podcast, and the new horizons of community-building across the film music universe, I am excited for the future of SCOREcast and I want to tell you personally how grateful I am for the part that you have played in our success. We are excited to bring even more awareness, information, opinion, editorial, review, and debate to the already incredibly diverse SCOREcast audience in this fifth year.</p>
<h3>SCOREcastOnline.com</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve redesigned the website—the third version since its launch in July of 2009. The new site will push to the web today, in conjunction with our anniversary festivities (watch the site for details on all that&#8217;s happening this month for our anniversary!). I believe the new design brings with it several key features that are going to revolutionize much of the way our film music community interacts with one another. Forums (in beta now&#8230; with much input and guidance from all of you), multi-author collaboration, videocasts, product reviews, and reader-submitted content are only a few of the new features that we are implementing for this re-launch.</p>
<h4><em>Channel Content</em></h4>
<p><strong><em></em></strong>We have divided the site up into &#8220;channels&#8221;: Business, Technology, Community, Workflow, and Composition. Each channel has a <em>senior editor</em>, with a cadre of contributing authors working with that person to bring the most up-to-date and relevant content to the forefront on each channel. More on this in a second&#8230;</p>
<h4><em>Advertising</em></h4>
<p><strong><em></em></strong>We are also opening up the site and podcast to outside advertisers for the first time in SCOREcast history. Manufacturers and developers have hounded us about this for years, but I&#8217;ve been a big proponent of us thoroughly researching this tactic before we actually pulled the trigger. I have always believed that the unique authority we&#8217;ve built so quickly within the community has come about partly because we are beholden to no one—we&#8217;ve never taken corporate sponsors, advertising money, or endorsements by anyone other than the aforementioned academic institutions. After years of careful research, thought and consideration, the Advisory Board has devised a way to enable software and gear manufacturers to partner with SCOREcast in advertising to our community without a muzzle being placed on our contributors, product reviewers, and authors. I am very pleased and excited about this model for advertising on <a href="../../..">SCOREcastOnline.com</a>, and you will start seeing the first of these partnerships towards the beginning of 2012.</p>
<h4><em>Chapter Communities</em></h4>
<p><strong><em></em></strong>In 2009, we launched <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/composium/">SCOREcast: London</a>—our very first international Chapter Community. James Semple, our SCOREcast: London chapter director, has done one hell of an amazing job cultivating and caring for the large SCOREcast community of UK composers in that region of the world. Off the success of SCOREcast: London, we also launched <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/sco.socal/">SCOREcast: Hollywood</a>, which blew up with over 125 community members within the first two hours of launching, and is being spearheaded by Los Angeles composer Johnny Knittle and his team. We are now training chapter directors for Boston, Austin, Berlin, and Toronto with our &#8220;SCO In a Box&#8221; program, and we plan to launch several more Community Chapters throughout 2012.</p>
<h4><em>Senior Editorial Staff</em></h4>
<p>To better serve our readership and community, we are adding to the editorial staff that will oversee each of the previously mentioned channels. Our international team of contributing writers, reviewers, community managers, and forum moderators has grown exponentially and we are excited to introduce all of these people to you over the next three weeks as we roll out our anniversary festivities.</p>
<h3>Thank YOU</h3>
<p>Thank you. Thank <em>YOU</em>. You have been huge in this, and you may not even realize it. All of the commenting, the visits, the <a href="http://twitter.com/scorecastonline" target="_blank">Retweets</a>, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SCOREcastOnline" target="_blank">Facebook</a> status messages, the discussion, the debate, the disagreeing, the nods of approval, the sharing&#8230; it all has meant so much to us. It really keeps us going. It makes this all worthwhile in every way. Please don&#8217;t stop. Keep helping us spread the message that a career in the film, television, and game music industry is one of the most rewarding and creative careers out there.</p>
<p>Thank you for sticking with us for five long years. We&#8217;re ALL excited to see what happens this year. If you want to be even more involved than you are now—to take the next step and become part of the team around here—<a href="mailto: scorecastonline@gmail.com" target="_blank">drop us a line</a> and let us know what you have in mind. There are many places to serve. It&#8217;s a big community!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Nothing lasts forever. It's time to face the end of an era. Much, much more after the jump...]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First of all, don&#8217;t let the headline of this post freak you out. &#8220;All Good Things Must Come to an End&#8221; refers specifically to the self-imposed hiatus that the beloved <a href="../../../category/podcast" target="_blank">SCOREcast podcast</a> has been on for close to a year.</p>
<p>Gotcha!</p>
<p>In addition to the recent issues we&#8217;ve had with the RSS feed of the older podcast episodes (issues that are now <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/scorecastonline/status/6907931853324288" target="_blank">fixed</a>, by the way!), I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve noticed that we haven&#8217;t posted a new podcast episode since me and Randy Knaub&#8217;s <a href="../../../2010/01/scorecast-no-26-podcast-shownotes.html" target="_blank">wrap-up of the 2010 NAMM Show</a> back in January of this year. Many of you have written in from all over the world to ask the obvious questions: &#8220;Is it over?&#8221; &#8220;Is there <em>ever</em> going to be another SCOREcast podcast episode?&#8221; &#8220;Why did you stop doing the podcast?&#8221;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Well&#8230; I&#8217;m thrilled to report that we will be posting <em><strong>SCOREcast Episode 27</strong></em> in the next few weeks, and that the podcast will resume its regular episodic schedule throughout 2011.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know it&#8217;s been awhile, but yes&#8230; we are back, and I&#8217;m more excited than ever about what is in store for the podcast during the coming year. We&#8217;ll be shaking up the format quite a bit by adding some cool new segments including new roundtables with some of film music&#8217;s most respected composers, music editors, and directors, as well as more interviews, listener mail, and current film music industry news and commentary.</p>
<p>On top of all that, we also have a giant glaring question to answer: Who won our &#8220;SCOREcast Theme Contest&#8221;?</p>
<p>All of these things—and MORE!—will be answered and dealt with in <em><strong>SCOREcast Episode 27</strong></em><strong><em></em></strong>. Look for the new episode in the coming weeks!</p>
<p><strong>Where Have We Been?</strong><br />
First of all—it&#8217;s all <em>my</em> fault. I made the call to put the podcast on ice back in February for a few reasons:</p>
<p><em>Reason #1: We were crispy.</em><br />
It takes a lot to produce an episode of SCOREcast. When I started SCOREcast in 2006, I made it a personal rule to never allow the SCOREcast podcast or the SCOREcastOnline.com website (SCO) to eclipse any of our contributors&#8217; careers, or mine. By January 2010, three solid years of producing the podcast had caught up with me and the rest of the team and we needed a break. Now granted, that &#8220;break&#8221; was never intended to be quite so long&#8230; but stuff happens, work takes over, people get busy, and things get put on the back burner. Bottom line is—<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>we are back</em></span> and it&#8217;s going to be a great new year with fresh energy, new features, and a few new personalities that I&#8217;m excited for you to meet and get to know.</p>
<p><em>Reason #2: We needed more help.</em><br />
As a circumstance of SCOREcastOnline.com&#8217;s growing audience (we are now read by over 90,000 people every week), we needed to expand the SCO contributor team and concentrate on making sure that our infrastructure was able to withstand a continued run of the podcast show. One thing we have learned for sure is that the SCOREcast podcast remains the biggest viral gateway to SCOREcastOnline.com, therefore drilling into the website to improve some areas that we found lacking was a necessary focus over the summer. The production of the podcast would need to be temporarily suspended if we were going find the time to do that effectively.</p>
<p><em>Reason #3: We needed to find out a little more about YOU.</em><br />
Podcast technology is pretty damned amazing. The fact that anyone can produce a radio show, put it online, syndicate it worldwide, and build a constituency that they wouldn&#8217;t normally have access to is downright amazing. However, the technology is still in its infancy and one of the things that is yet to be perfected is the ability to keep track of exactly who is downloading and listening to your content. <em>Syndication</em> is a both a blessing and a curse. Yes, your content gets dispersed all over the Internet and rebroadcast from multiple outlets, giving you access to a huge potential audience. However, <em>that</em> process also makes it virtually impossible for you to track your audience via any hard data.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not even the <em>big</em> problem. It&#8217;s even harder to track whether or not your content is even useful to your audience once they have access to it. Because of that limitation, I needed convincing that we were providing the very best content that we could for all of you. In an effort to get a grip on what you guys are after from SCOREcast, we sent out a survey to a random selection of our SCO readership last month. Based on the data we received back from the survey, I think we&#8217;ve come up with a format and feature-set that will better serve our community overall. We&#8217;re going to run with it, and it&#8217;s full steam ahead from here on!</p>
<p><strong>Onward and Upward</strong><br />
In hindsight, I&#8217;m pleased with the results that our hiatus produced, and I think you&#8217;ll agree that whatever annoyance our absence may have caused you has well been worth it. That being said, the responsibility of producing a successful podcast show is something I definitely do not take lightly, and I have learned a ton in the four years that I&#8217;ve been doing it. As with everything here at SCOREcast, the podcast is something that we all give to in our spare time. We may occasionally go AWOL, but we will always return.</p>
<p>And I promise&#8230; it will never again be as long a vacation as this one was!</p>
<p>My sincerest thanks to each and every one of you in the SCO Army who have hung in there with us.<br />
YOU are the true heroes of this community.</p>
<p>My very best,<br />
<em><strong>Deane Ogden</strong></em><br />

Welcome to the new and improved SCOREcastOnline.com!]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sig-ogden2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-463" title="sig-ogden" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sig-ogden2.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>Welcome to the new and improved SCOREcastOnline.com!</p>
<p>Our inaugural year has been a total blast! I knew that if we could do something to more carefully connect our professional film music community,  amazing things would happen. What I didn&#8217;t count on was this community getting behind SCOREcast in the way that it has. Kudos to each and every one of you for building this community and really making this professional film music family an amazing group to be a part of. This website is for YOU!</p>
<p>Our first year online has been spent on Google&#8217;s awesome Blogger platform. However, with the expanding number of community-members posting relevant commentary and rich content, our daily readership is reaching into the 40,000&#8217;s, and we needed to make a change&#8230; badly.</p>
<p>We are now self-hosting the site on our own servers and have migrated to the more robust WordPress platform. For the last six days, my amazingly talented assistant, Duncan Kirk Bohannon, has been hand-coding this new version of the SCO experience, and I think you are going to love it!</p>
<p>Some of the enhancements include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Content Organization</strong> — Now you can search for articles in several of the most relevant categories we could think of (and actually&#8230; we are still thinking and wondering exactly what the 8 most relevant categories would be to pro film music makers, so if you have any suggestions, hit us up on the <a href="../../../contact" target="_blank">Contact</a> page).</li>
<li><strong>Better Post Tags</strong> — We&#8217;ve whittled down the tags on the site to make it easier for you to cruise around and view the content you really want to view. You can also view the entire tag list in the &#8220;Tags&#8221; section to the right and read a stream of content on *that* particular topic all on one page.</li>
<li><strong>Video and Audio Content</strong> — For a long time, we&#8217;ve needed the ability to not only post <em>audio</em> in our RSS site feed for you, but <em>video</em> as well. Now we can, and we plan to take extreme advantage of it!</li>
<li><strong>Easy Article Submissions</strong> — One of the best moves we made all year was inviting several of professional film music&#8217;s most exciting people to join our contributing editor team. But to truly have an all-encompassing community forum, the entire community needs to have a voice. We&#8217;ve now included article submission uploads on the <a href="../contact" target="_blank">Contact</a> page, and if you have an idea for a SCOREcast article&#8230; we&#8217;d LOVE to hear it!</li>
<li><strong>Social Network Sharing</strong> —As we all scramble to embrace the social networking technology that is making all of this possible, we thought it might be beneficial to include as many of the popular social networks in our sharing scheme as possible. In only one-click, you can now post your favorite SCOREcast content from any page to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/SCOREcastOnline" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/scorecastonline" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, Digg, Google Bookmarks, MySpace, Technorati, StumbleUpon, and a whole bunch of other networking sites. Spread the word!!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Podcasts</strong><br />
Of course, with a major move like this, we are still working out a few bugs. On the new <a href="../../../category/podcast" target="_self">Podcast page</a>, you can listen the last dozen podcast episodes in a slick new pop-out player that resides next to that episode&#8217;s corresponding shownotes. We are still working to get the podcast player that you are used to up on the front page, and it might take a few cracks at it until we figure out the best solution for that. Believe me, we are as anxious as you are to get Episode 27 on the air&#8230; give us a little more time, and we&#8217;ll deliver (famous last words of a film composer!).</p>
<p><strong>Comments</strong><br />
Also, most of your previous <em>comments</em> are showing up in all posts,while others still have yet to migrate over. Still yet, for a few posts, we were simply unable to hang onto *all* of the comments. With a move like this, we basically jumped through three hoops that make for a big combined &#8220;no no&#8221; when you are designing a website transition: <em>hosting jumps</em>, <em>domain transfers</em>, and <em>platform switching</em>. We did all three simultaneously, and the casualty of war was a few comments here and there. You can still COMMENT in the same way you always have—log in or create a <a href="http://disqus.com" target="_blank">Disqus</a> account by simply leaving your first comment after any post—but some of your previous posts will take a little more monkeying on our end to get back in the system.</p>
<p>All-in-all, there are over 200 enhancements that have gone into this new version of SCO. I wish I could list them all here&#8230; but, frankly, I don&#8217;t know what 199 of them mean! (&#8220;<em>I&#8217;m a film composer, Jim&#8230; not a web designer!&#8221;</em>) <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>What I *do* know is that with this new upgrade, SCO is now poised to keep bringing you the quality content I believe we&#8217;ve come to be known by, for the next several years, as well as expanding that content to include new and developing ways to communicate with YOU—our over 40,000 daily online readers. In the coming weeks, you&#8217;ll witness even more opportunities for interaction with your professional film music family at SCO, and we are excited to see what happens with it all. For now, cruise around, kick the tires a bit, and <a href="../../../contact" target="_self">hit us back</a> with any features you&#8217;d like to see in the future.</p>
<p>This is YOUR community&#8230; Build it, challenge it, question it, ponder it, lead it, love it, live it!</p>

He&#8217;ll be back next week to challenge you with an all new Weekend Provocation.</p>
<p>Right now, though, I have a HUGE announcement to make…<br />
<a name="more"></a><br />
Last year, over Memorial Day weekend, we launched SCOREcastOnline.com. The idea for a SCOREcast website seemed like the obvious move in the natural progression from the SCOREcast podcast episodes, and felt like a necessary step toward our goal of bringing the professional film music community closer.</p>
<p>At the time of the launch, we weren&#8217;t sure if an SCO site would be a raging success, or go over like a lead balloon. I&#8217;m happy to report that because of your loyalty as subscribers, the word of mouth that makes our industry the great harbor that it is, and quality, consistent content from the best people working in film music, you have grown this website community to over 40,000 hits… PER DAY.</p>
<p>And this weekend, we&#8217;ll be upping the ante again.</p>
<p>We are moving the site to a new host and making a significant site modification to SCO on Saturday night. If you visit SCO between 4pm (PST) Saturday and Sunday evening, you might find it to be &#8220;down for maintenance&#8221; or, in the case of whatever browser you might be using, you&#8217;ll encounter a &#8220;this site cannot be found&#8221; error message.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry—we are simply uploading the new website and we will be back with a vengeance on Monday morning, bright and early.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t spill too many beans here (you&#8217;ll be pleasantly surprised Monday morning, I&#8217;m certain of it!), but this simple yet significant &#8220;next-level&#8221; modification to the way we do chicken around here will set SCO up for the next several years of growth, killer written content, audio and video (!) podcast episodes, and many more exciting features that we wouldn&#8217;t be able to offer you if we were to simply stay put and maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>But then again… we aren&#8217;t really the type to do *that* anyway!</p>
<p>Thank you—from the bottom of my heart—for making SCO such a runaway success. If we can do this in one year, imagine what we can do in two!</p>
<p>All my best,<br />
Deane Ogden<br />
Founder, SCOREcastOnline.com</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-359" href="../../../2010/04/composers-unionization-new-goals-new.html/sig-sco_white"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-359" title="sig-SCO_white" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sig-SCO_white.png" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>Tuesday night, April 19, 2010, the Association of Media Composers and Lyricists&#8217; (AMCL) presented their second public meeting concerning the effort to unionize composers and lyricists under the umbrella of the Teamsters Local 399.</p>
<p>Held in Beverly Hills at the Writers Guild Theater, the official proceedings began with a welcome message from AMCL spokesman Bruce Broughton, who outlined that the new focus of the AMCL unionization effort would be to secure &#8220;benefits only&#8221; for composers and lyricists—a message quite different from November&#8217;s initial meeting, where the committee announced that &#8220;wage minimums and working conditions&#8221; would also be included in the negotiations.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Speaking to SCOREcast just prior to the start of the meeting, Bruce Broughton told us, &#8220;I&#8217;m happy. This is a great turnout and we have a solid plan. I think we are ready now to really get something done. We finally know what we are doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>A statement was presented by actor and Screen Actors Guild representative, James Cromwell, indicating SAG&#8217;s commitment to support composer unionization. Writers Guild West executive director, David Young, also gave a statement from the WGA West in support of a composers union, vowing that &#8220;the WGA West will support you in every way we can&#8221;.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/S83D58Ak-gI/AAAAAAAAA18/G-7SxWVouvo/s1600/IMG_0002.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/S83D58Ak-gI/AAAAAAAAA18/G-7SxWVouvo/s320/IMG_0002.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="240" height="320" /></a></div>
<p>In the lobby, a 3&#215;4 panel was on display with the names of 250 composers, lyricists, actors, producers, and directors indicating support of the union effort. Names on the list included composers Hans Zimmer, John Ottman, Marco Beltrami, Carter Burwell, and Thomas Newman, producers Steven Bochco, Aaron Sorkin, and Dick Wolf, and director Edward Zwick.</p>
<p>Several letters of support were read throughout the evening, including one from director/producer Ron Howard.</p>
<p>The AMCL&#8217;s recent move to fight for &#8220;benefits only&#8221; was indicated by many in attendance to be the tipping point for support, and the AMCL Organizing Committee stated several times that the their main focus would be to first protect &#8220;working&#8221; composers and lyricists in the film and television music industry.</p>
<p>From the dais, AMCL Organizing Committee member and composer Mike Post stated, &#8220;I will not be a part of a union that is lead by non-working people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The second part of the meeting was opened up to members of the audience to ask questions and gain clarification on several key points raised by the AMCL Committee throughout the evening.</p>
<p>As of yet, no further meetings have been announced by the AMCL, but we will continue to keep you informed of further information here at <a href="http://www.scorecastonline.com./">SCOREcastOnline.com.</a></p>

<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-431" href="../../../2010/04/composer-unionization-amcl-announces.html/sig-sco_white-17"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-431" title="sig-SCO_white" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sig-SCO_white2.png" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>The Association of Media Composers and Lyricists (AMCL) has announced its next organizing meeting on April 19, 2010, to update composers and lyricists on its progress in regards to unionizing the group under the Teamsters 399 banner. The message, sent via email to its mailing list members, also reflects last week&#8217;s resignation of the group&#8217;s founder, Alan Elliott (his name is now absent from the list of participating committee members), and indicates that three new members have joined the committee—composers Richard Marvin, Sean Callery, and Snuffy Walden.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>The announcement reads as follows:<br />
<em><br />
</em><br />
<em>You are invited to attend an important event: an organizing meeting of the Association of Media Composers and Lyricists, hosted by Teamsters Local 399 on April 19, 2010 to be held at the Writers Guild Theater.</em><br />
<em><br />
</em><br />
<em> </em><em>On November 16, 2009, an informational meeting was attended by 350 composers and lyricists, half of whom signed cards indicating they wished to be represented by Teamsters 399 in negotiating a collective bargaining agreement with production companies.</em><br />
<em><br />
</em><br />
<em></em><em>If you were there that evening, this will be an opportunity to hear about the considerable progress we&#8217;ve made since then, including the support we&#8217;re receiving from other guilds. If you couldn&#8217;t get to the November event, this will be a chance to learn firsthand about the possibilities for unionization, to ask questions, and to make your own voice heard.</em><br />
<em><br />
</em><br />
<em></em><em>We urge all composers and lyricists to attend.</em><br />
<em><br />
</em><br />
<em></em><em>Parking is available and is being paid by the Teamsters in the structure directly south of the Writers Guild Theater.</em><br />
<em><br />
</em><br />

<p>As I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard, Michael Jackson died today in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>If film composers are musicians that put music to film, then Michael Jackson was a musician who put film to music. In addition to his obvious contributions to the world of pop music, Michael Jackson produced some of the most innovative pieces of visual imagery in the form of the world&#8217;s first long-play music videos.</p>
<p>As a child of the 80&#8217;s, I was fascinated to see what Michael Jackson would do next. I would just as eagerly anticipate the MTV countdown of a Michael Jackson World Premiere video as I would the next installment of the Indiana Jones series or the next Jim Cameron film. His sense of cinematic payoff was astounding, even up to his later videos of the 1990&#8217;s and on into the new millennium.</p>
<p>It has always been sad to me, and maybe a mark of where we&#8217;ve fallen down a bit as a people group, that we condemn those who we perceive as having done something before we are sure they did. I do not know what demons haunted Michael Jackson in his life, and for that matter, I don&#8217;t know that <i>any</i> did. I just know the man that brought <i>Thriller</i> to my turntable, <i>Bad</i> to my mental production thoughtscape, and <i>Dangerous</i> to a musically clueless generation.</p>
<p>That is how I will remember the man.</p>

<p>My big audacious goal was to stay up last night to watch this happen in real time, but I fell asleep like a loser and just didn&#8217;t have the stamina to hang in and watch it all unfold. :op<span class="fullpost"></p>
<p>This is a day that I&#8217;ve been waiting for for about three years – the day that SCOREcast grows up, takes the gloves off, puts its big-boy pants on and gets serious about mentoring, coaching, and helping people navigate through the jungle of the film music business.</p>
<p>This launch has not been without its obstacles, pratfalls, and perils &#8211; most of them technical, of course &#8211; as we&#8217;ve tried to figure out the best way to bring you all the content you want and have come to expect from the SCOREcast podcasts over the years. But the biggest challenge was not technical at all. In all honesty, my biggest fear was that some of you might be thinking what I would be thinking if I were you: &#8220;Oh great! Another film music site that is going to over-promise and under-deliver. Another site that is going to tell me how much they can help me if I sign up for their membership, download their guide, and attend their seminar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well&#8230; no. Actually, not at all. When we started broadcasting podcast episodes in October of 2006, I promised myself that if we ever made it difficult for people to get into the film music world by making them jump through a bunch of hoops to get to our content, then we have failed at our objectives. I&#8217;ve said it before on the podcast, and I&#8217;ll say it again here: There has never been a better time for you to launch your career in film music, and SCOREcast is a tool for you to use to accomplish that goal. Pure and simple. No strings attached. Besides, the best things in life are still free, baby!</p>
<p>But in all seriousness, that IS the essence of SCOREcast: Helping you launch and maintain a healthy, lasting, and fruitful film music career. Here you will find seasoned mentors as well as people who have never written a note. Here you will find people who are interested in sharing with you the TRUTH about how they got into this business, as well as people who will share with you the TRUTH about why they never quite made it. Here you will find those who are not afraid to talk to you about what you should be doing, as well as those who will tell you what you are doing right.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all been there. Everyone started somewhere. Whether we were assistants to composers or scoring student films for pizza and beer, we&#8217;ve all been at the crossroads of not knowing where to go next to get to the next level in our careers. So, this is where all of that wondering and not knowing can change for you as you peel back the onion that is this business.</p>
<p>My advice? Get involved here at SCOREcastOnline.com. <span style="font-style: italic;">Login for free</span> (!!!) and get to know some folks. There are thousands of people here that listen to our podcasts every month that are in the same boat you are in, and there are just as many that have achieved in this business what you desire to achieve in your own career. So why reinvent the wheel? Find those people &#8211; they love to talk about this stuff &#8211; and get to know them. The new way of the world is &#8220;access&#8221;. Use it that opportunity here at SCOREcastOnline.com and be enriched by it.</p>
<p>As SCOREcast launches into this new era, come on the ride with us. I promise it will be worth the adventure!</span></p>
