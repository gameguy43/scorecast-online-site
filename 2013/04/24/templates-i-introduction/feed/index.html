					<description><![CDATA[Hi it&#039;s me again - just wanted to share some thoughts around templates. I see the advantages of setting up a template or several templates according to your needs but one thing I&#039;ve found really frustrating is when you want to create say a new template and choose big music libraries like Hollywood Strings where the RAM is just never enough unless you have 5 PC&#039;s with lots of RAM but then this would probably cost a fortune and not many people can afford this unless you&#039;re in the Business and making a living from this. I am always looking for the great sound out from orchestral librairies and there&#039;s nothing more frustrating than loading a huge 1st violins with its numerous mic positions and finding you&#039;re already using 5 to 6 GB of RAM! Imagine loading up the rest of the strings with its different articulations.... Surely we could do a much better job at how the RAM and stream from disk works today. Anyway this is probably getting too technical here so anyway this is just some thoughts I wanted to share with the world. Cheers. ]]></description>
