		<description>Now THIS is an interesting point to me (actually the entire article AND resultant discussion has been fascinating). As I started doing orchestral mockups of my music, I found that my perception of what an orchestra sounds like is based on years of sitting in the middle of the French Horn section! I very often have to step back and check a reference recording that I love to get my ears back on track.</description>

		<description>William -&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#039;t have an expert answer to this question yet.  However, here&#039;s what I think:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1) As I&#039;ve maintained consistently, using breath control (or, at least, &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; that you can vary continuously) is very important if you want to play expressively.  You can set a WIVI flute to give you faster attack on every note, but then you&#039;re stuck with that articulation and have discarded an important means of expression.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&#039;re playing live or entering a musical line into your DAW by playing in real time, breath control is especially great as the principal thing you vary, because it&#039;s feasible to vary it with each note -- e.g., to get a sharp attack on one note and a gradual attack on the next.  In theory, you could do that with, say, the mod wheel, but you&#039;d have to be awfully fast and accurate to get close to what you can do with breath.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(The above breath control advantage, of course, is &lt;i&gt;in addition&lt;/i&gt; to the fact that breath control varies both the amplitude and the timbre of the currently-sounding note -- at any time.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OK, now I&#039;ll stop beating incessantly on that point!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(2) Next, let&#039;s assume you&#039;re playing the WIVI from your keyboard, are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; using a breath controller, and just want to set your WIVI so that all notes have a faster (but not necessarily equal) attack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, remember to set Breath CC to VEL in the General Settings.  That way, at least you have &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; expressivity control, because in this mode, various properties of notes and note transitions will vary as a function of note velocity (key velocity).  In addition, if you have a keyboard that generates aftertouch messages according to how much pressure you exert on the keys after pressing them, you can use this as a very easy way to control vibrato depth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, given the above setting, attack will get faster as key velocity increases.  However, there will be some &lt;i&gt;maximum attack speed&lt;/i&gt; (minimum attack time).  If that maximum attack speed isn&#039;t fast enough for you, you can change it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To increase the maximum attack speed (or, equivalently, decrease the minimum attack time), select the Control parameters panel by clicking on the rightmost button just below the place where you select instruments.  Then use your mouse to grab the control panel and scroll it down until you see the area with the heading &quot;BREATH ENVELOPE&quot;.  In this area, you&#039;ll find a set of parameters that affect things WIVI will do &lt;i&gt;automatically&lt;/i&gt; to the breath signal as you play. (I.e., for each note, the WIVI generates for you a puff of breath having one shape or another, given that you&#039;re not using a breath controller to create this puff yourself -- and the parameters let you influence the shape that the WIVI gives to that puff.)  As you can see, there are &lt;i&gt;several&lt;/i&gt; things you could modify to influence the maximum attack speed.  For example, if you increase the value of the &quot;Key attack spd.&quot; parameter, you&#039;ll be able to get faster attacks on your flute notes.  You can set the value &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; high and get very fast attacks -- but then, of course, you&#039;ll get a sound that&#039;s different from a real flute.  If that&#039;s what you want, great.  If not, be more moderate in your setting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#039;d suggest experimenting around with the various parameters in this area, to see what they do.  I&#039;m by no means an expert on all of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TIP:  If you haven&#039;t discovered this yet, the WIVI interface has built-in documentation in the form of &quot;tool tips&quot;.  For example, if you want to see the documentation for the &quot;Key attack spd.&quot; parameter, double-click in the field where you set the value for this parameter, and the documentation will appear as a &quot;tool tip&quot;.  Click once on the tooltip window to make it go away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(3) One problem with many of the parameters in the BREATH ENVELOPE area (specifically, from &quot;Breath speed&quot; down to &quot;Key release spd.&quot;) is that you can&#039;t assign a MIDI CC to them.  If you could, you&#039;d be able to vary their values in real time as you play.  But you can&#039;t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;&gt;However&lt;/i&gt;, though it may not be obvious, MIDI CCs &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; be assigned to another group of these parameters.  Just above the &quot;Breath speed&quot; parameter you&#039;ll see a window that graphically depicts the shape of the breath envelope, and above that, a field where you select the name of a parameter that you want to adjust.  If you&#039;re coming here for the first time, this field will say &quot;Attack time&quot;.  You set its value via the three controls just below the breath envelope graphic display.  Now, click once on the arrow button to the right of the parameter name field.  If the field initially said &quot;Attack time&quot;, it will now say &quot;Attack time CC&quot;.  I.e., this is how you can assign a continuous controller (CC) to the Attack time parameter.  If you haven&#039;t assigned a CC before, I think this CC will be set to VEL -- meaning that attack time is controlled by key velocity.  Thus if you want to direct control over Attack time rather than live with the automatic linkage of Attack time to velocity, assign a CC and control it yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(4) I suspect you might also be able to change the note articulations of your WIVI flute to be more to your liking by adjusting the controls in the TRANSITIONS, PORTAMENTO, and LEGATO areas, which are further down in the Control parameters panel.  These controls also have the advantage that you can assign MIDI CCs to them.  For example, when working on a musical line in my DAW, I find it can be very helpful to set the &quot;Transition CC&quot; parameter to assign a CC for note transition control.  Then, if something doesn&#039;t sound right, I have a control I can adjust (by hand-editing the control contour in my DAW) -- and &lt;i&gt;voila&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well -- enough for now.  As you can see, there&#039;s a whole world to explore here.  Imagine being an expert on all of this, and developing the chops to work all of these controls as fast as you can think!</description>

<p>I don&#39;t have an expert answer to this question yet.  However, here&#39;s what I think:</p>

<p>(The above breath control advantage, of course, is <i>in addition</i> to the fact that breath control varies both the amplitude and the timbre of the currently-sounding note &#8212; at any time.)</p>

		<description>@ Jim: Thanks for pointing that out about the newest demo. Sure enough I have version 2.1 and they are up to 2.22 now. I don&#039;t know that it will make a big difference, but I downloaded the new one and will mess with it when I get a chance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the meantime, is there a way to get more of an attack on notes other than manipulating CC2? On the flute, for instance, I&#039;d like to hear a more forceful attack and can&#039;t seem to produce it.</description>

		<description>News!  SampleModeling is about to release two new saxophone virtual instruments (an alto and a baritone), adding to the already-available and awesome &quot;The Trumpet&quot; (which actually includes trumpet, flugelhorn, cornet, and piccolo trumpet) and &quot;Mr. Sax T.&quot; (tenor sax).  They&#039;re designed to work with Kontakt 3.5, and will be released as soon as this new version of Kontakt progresses from beta to regular release.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That still doesn&#039;t put SampleModeling up with WIVI as far as coverage of a comprehensive range of orchestral instruments, but for sheer quality, realism of sound, expressiveness, and for specialty applications, Sample Modeling&#039;s instruments are currently unsurpassed,  in my opinion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SampleModeling has an excellent collection of demo MP3s on their site.  In addition, there&#039;s a very impressive video demo of the tenor sax (Mr. Sax. T.) available on YouTube:  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs1rk6M-n60&amp;feature=related&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs1rk6M-n60&amp;feat...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have both &quot;The Trumpet&quot; and &quot;Mr. Sax T.&quot; and can attest first-hand to how good they are and to the fact that they are very playable &quot;live&quot;, using a keyboard and a MIDI continuous controller (though you can also use a breath controller).  I&#039;ve also used Mr. Sax T to create a sax solo on an original song I wrote and recorded in March, 2009.</description>

		<description>William,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#039;m not sure which version of the demo you have, but the current version of the product has an &quot;Anechoic Chamber&quot; setting which gives you just direct sound -- not just pretty dry, but absolutely dry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is also something called &quot;Studio&quot;, but it still has quite a bit of reverb, although it&#039;s dryer than the Symphony Hall, Church, or Auditorium environments.  I wasn&#039;t a whole lot happier with the Studio preset than the Symphony Hall preset, so I&#039;ve stayed away from all of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, when using the Anechoic Chamber setting, the instruments once again sound really weird, because of the total absence of any ambient sound.  So, if you use this setting, you need to apply some sort of good-sounding reverb external to WIVI.  As I mentioned, I&#039;m currently using WaveArts MasterVerb and Voxengo Pristine Space.  For the latter, of course, you have to load a suitable impulse response.  I use one that provides true stereo reverb.  Altiverb would also work well.</description>

		<description>Arturia&#039;s BRASS is based on a new method of physical modeling developed by IRCAM. You can read about it on their web site:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arturia.com/evolution/en/products/brass/behind.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.arturia.com/evolution/en/products/br...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My general understanding is that much of the work that&#039;s going into BRASS v2 has to do with *control* of the model, as much as the DSP behind the model itself. As it turns out - that&#039;s particularly critical when it comes to an instrument that has such direct correlation to the behavior of &quot;the real thing&quot;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an example: It&#039;s difficult to figure out how the context for a half-valve effect on trumpet when there&#039;s no direct way to correlate lip pressure and air flow in a model the *sometimes* treats them separately and other times puts them together. That&#039;s somewhat intuitive on an actual instrument, but when programming it into a modeled instrument, you have to come up with a lot of non-intuitive methods to exact the same kind of control. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As it turns out, there&#039;s a lot of this kind of work in all types of virtual instruments, whether sampled, re-synthesized or physically modeled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aside from all of that - I&#039;ve got to say that this is a *great* article and a fantastic follow-up discussion. Thanks for all of the work you put into this, Jim. I can&#039;t wait to hear what you do with Rite of Spring.</description>

		<description>This is a great point. I&#039;ve heard LOTS of comments from &quot;professional&quot; composers that pass judgment on a library based on a single rough/early demo - or a user sample that may come from someone that doesn&#039;t have the technical or musical chops to really exploit the instrument. Upon hearing something that confirms their pre-disposition they throw up their hands. That&#039;s really unfair to the developers, and it&#039;s also unfair to the composer who might have missed out on a great creative opportunity. I&#039;ve heard every excuse from &quot;I&#039;m too busy doing *real* work&quot; to &quot;it seemed complicated so I just played the demo MP3s&quot; that I just filter those comments to &quot;I&#039;m lazy&quot; and let the conversation die a natural death as quickly as possible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To me - the most important part of being a composer is in being interested in the details, and making new creative and technical discoveries are as important as chasing down your next project. Granted, there are a LOT of demos out there that fall short of the product - the web is rife with MP3s that don&#039;t come close to the potential of the instrument they represent. Everyone talks about it - *all* the time. It&#039;s a favorite saw in music discussion forums (including the present case here). So it surprises me when I read that composers are *still* surprised that an audition cue falls short of their expectations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For *my* money, I *ALWAYS* go into a demo cue thinking that it&#039;s going to suck. First of all, you never know what the person was thinking/doing or their abilities/goals when they produced the cue. Were they just putting out something to show a new preset or technical capability - or are they asserting &quot;that&#039;s how Hans Zimmer would do it&quot;? Those are two totally different goals - and even though it&#039;s sometimes unstated - the listener is often imposing their own standards (which is often higher than they have for their own music) instead of listening without prejudice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secondly, I&#039;m almost always distracted by the musical choices made in a cue. I&#039;m an extremely picky person, and (as many composers are want to think) believe that my choices are better or more cogent than anyone else&#039;s. Since 50% of what I often pay attention to has *nothing* to do with the quality of the instrument, I automatically self-censure to calibrate against my own bias - but that&#039;s just me... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Such as they are - I was tantalized by the demos for the WIVI. When I have the schedule (and the budget) to consider them properly, I&#039;ll definitely be pulling down the trail version and taking it through its paces.</description>

		<description>The demo does come with a very dry built-in setting called &quot;Studio.&quot; You just have to click on the arrows under &quot;Preset Environments.&quot; I used the studio environment and applied my own convolution reverb to the sounds when trying it out again recently. When they made the first demo, you could only use the one hall setting, which was pretty atrocious. I remember everyone complaining that you couldn&#039;t really tell what the instruments sounded like.</description>

		<description>Houston,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think you&#039;re making some fabulous points here!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;View from a nerd (me):  I wouldn&#039;t use the term &quot;physical model&quot; to describe a WIVI.  With WIVIs, I think what&#039;s being modeled is really the input/output behavior, but not the physical structure that produces it.  It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; possible to use real principles of physical acoustics to construct a model of an instrument -- Yamaha&#039;s VL-70m is an example of an awesome product that does this (and, not surprisingly, is also designed to be played with a wind controller).  Arturia may be another example, but I&#039;m not familiar enough with it to know.  My impression was that WIVIs were way ahead of the Arturia product, based on the Arturia demos I heard, so I haven&#039;t pursued Arturia further.  I hope somebody will write an Arturia article and set me straight!  The instruments from Sample Modeling (The Trumpet and Mr. Sax T.) are &lt;i&gt;fantastic&lt;/i&gt; products that work on the basis of yet another type of modeling technique, that I don&#039;t understand very well.  I have them, and treasure them, but with only two instruments in the family, they so far have a limited impact on my work.  I need to build orchestras.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You&#039;ve said, &quot;&lt;i&gt;Developers are putting a lot of work into ... the next generation of virtual instrument to simplify the controls, but it still requires a great deal of specific/idiomatic musicality to get something of use from them.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;  You know, I hope (and believe) that the element of practiced/studied musical skill will always be part of what&#039;s needed.  We need to have something that not just anybody can do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And:  &quot;&lt;i&gt; ... how far the film score baseline has shifted from standard arranging.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;  A very interesting observation.  It seems clear to me that there is, indeed, a &quot;cinematic sound&quot;.  Right now, in the School of Chops, I&#039;m in the process of trying to articulate for myself just what that sound &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;, and how it&#039;s created.  I think a full discussion of this topic would be a fantastic thing for SCOREcast Online to marshall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for these very illuminating insights, Houston!</description>

		<description>I like the concept of WIVI, but haven&#039;t done more than check out the demo&#039;s. I *do* have a physically modeled instrument plugin, using Arturia&#039;s BRASS for the occasional trumpet or trombone solo. I&#039;m waiting for BRASS v2 before I put the saxophone in a mix. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There definitely can be a point of diminishing returns when it comes to physically modeled virtual instruments. You must have not only the technical chops for editing the sounds for the right mix, you very often have to impart expression into these virtual instruments using similar methods to the *original* instruments in order to get an effective sound. I&#039;ve been using breath controllers of various types since college, but I can&#039;t imagine a drummer picking one up and puffing away for a musically effective result. I was a professional low brass player for years, and you can&#039;t replace that experience for producing an effective part (whether using a breath controller or a good pair of ears and a mixing console).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would be the same absurdity if I picked up a pair of drum sticks and started wailing away on electronic drums - and expected it to sound like Deane producing another hit track on the kit. It would simply be impossible without a lot of practice/work/editing - and even then it probably would still fall short of what &quot;a practiced hand&quot; can accomplish. Developers are putting a lot of work into this and the next generation of virtual instrument to simplify the controls, but it still requires a great deal of specific/idiomatic musicality to get something of use from them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as sample libraries go, I have a preference for libraries that might put a higher editing burden on the composer/producer for a more accurate result. For the EastWest libraries and others like it, they&#039;re very strong with a certain type of reproduction, but outside of their &quot;wheelhouse&quot; they suffer mightily. So as long as you&#039;re constraining your arrangement to a library&#039;s strengths, you can move quickly and with confidence. But I also believe that a library&#039;s limitations can artificially constrain the composer&#039;s creative flow, which is something I&#039;m not willing to sacrifice for the sake of expediency. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And FWIW, I have a very strong personal opinion that all of the hullabaloo about certain libraries being closer to &quot;production-ready&quot; than others is hogwash. I just think that folks tend to grow so well-worn to their own production techniques than anything *else* seems &quot;unnatural&quot;. I&#039;ve given up arguing the subject at this point, because it requires a person to postulate that they might be clouded by their own patterns and practices - and would never accept that their opinions could be more influenced by the work of Pavlov than by Rimsky-Korsakov. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#039;ll say one last thing about the subject, which has more to do with current orchestra mixing techniques than any virtual library: after my recent experience with compositing a handful of scores for an animation trailer, I was taken aback by the out-of-balance mixing of the scores I heard. The arrangements were unnervingly bass-heavy - and likewise the brass was *WAY* out of proportion to the other instruments. It was much more exaggerated than I had ever heard before. I honestly couldn&#039;t believe what I was hearing. It has caused me to re-think how I approach mixing - and definitely inspired me to seek out other scores to listen to as potential reference to see (or hear) how far the film score baseline has shifted from standard arranging. It somewhat argues that point that Deane often makes when we argue these topics - sounding just like an orchestra is often *not* what the client is looking for - they want to hear something that sounds like the last ten film scores they heard in the theater.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And so it goes...</description>

		<description>Deane asks, &quot;Is it starting to not matter anyway what a *real* orchestra sounds like since people don&#039;t really know to begin with?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the answer is a little tricky.  My first inclination is to answer that it&#039;s mattering less than it used to.  But from the point of view of a composer who both uses MIDI mockups and writes for traditional orchestra with the intention of recording the real orchestra, I think it matters a lot.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you work with MIDI mockups all the time, and don&#039;t get re-calibrated by listening to real orchestras, you start thinking as if the MIDI sound is a reliable reading on what the real orchestra will sound like when you record it playing your score.  Then, when you actually record the orchestra, you find out that the balance of the real orchestra (and maybe even the sounds of the individual instruments) is different.  If the balance is out of whack, the timbres and textures will be out of whack as a result. What worked in MIDI might not work with the real orchestra.  Scary prospect.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It seems the antidote is that a composer needs to make it a priority to stay calibrated on the sounds of real orchestras.  Maybe even on the sound of a &lt;i&gt;particular&lt;/i&gt; real orchestra, playing on a &lt;i&gt;particular&lt;/i&gt; scoring stage.</description>

		<description>Following up on a few things ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;(1)&lt;/b&gt; In my exchange with William Arnold, I had said I thought recalled that WIVIs defaulted to using velocity as means of controlling playing amplitude.  William said he thought they defaulted to CC2 -- breath control.  William was correct.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the way, we&#039;re talking here about a WIVI parameter called &quot;Breath CC&quot;.  You find it in the &quot;General Settings&quot; group of WIVI controls, and it defaults to CC2.  You can set it to any continuous controller (CC), and you can also set it to VEL (velocity).  If you set it to a CC, WIVI note amplitude and timbre respond to changes in the CC value at &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; time.  If you set it to VEL, the amplitude and timbre of notes you play will respond to key velocity instead -- but, true to the concept of key velocity, the amplitude and timbre are set at the beginning of the note and don&#039;t vary thereafter, so you lose an important component of expression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, if you don&#039;t know about the WIVI&#039;s &quot;Breath CC&quot; parameter or don&#039;t change its setting from the default, the WIVI will be expecting you to vary CC2 as you play.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is actually a very significant issue&lt;/b&gt; for someone who is trying out WIVI for the first time!  If you don&#039;t realize what&#039;s going on,  the CC2 default will likely lead to a poor first impression of WIVIs.  Let me explain why.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CC2 is the default because WIVIs are intended to be used with breath control.  If you&#039;re playing &quot;live&quot;, it&#039;s best to be using an actual breath controller, like a Yamaha BC3.  (If you&#039;re not playing live, you can edit breath control contours in your DAW.)  But many people don&#039;t use breath controllers, and do most of their composing work with just a keyboard -- the norm when working with sample libraries.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The question is:  &lt;i&gt;How does a WIVI behave if you hook a keyboard up to it, don&#039;t have a breath controller, have left &quot;Breath CC&quot; set to CC2, and just start playing?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The answer is:  You&#039;ll have &lt;i&gt;no dynamics&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/b&gt;  You touch your keyboard lightly, and you get a pretty hefty sound with more or less constant amplitude and pitch.  You bang hard on your keys, and you get the same thing!  That&#039;s because unless &quot;Breath CC&quot; is set to VEL, the WIVI pays no attention to key velocity!  &lt;b&gt;Beware!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deane, this might have happened when you did your initial WIVI evaluation.  If so, it would have caused you to think WIVIs were pretty crude.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;/b&gt;  If you&#039;re playing a WIVI &quot;live&quot;, with just a keyboard, set &quot;Breath CC&quot; to VEL.  This setting will give you some control over note dynamics.  You won&#039;t have the fantastic expressivity you can get with a breath controller -- but what you get is much better much better than &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;(2)&lt;/b&gt; I mentioned in the article that the WIVI environment provides built-in reverb which is highly controllable.  I won&#039;t go into all the details here.  But I would like to point out that, when using an ensemble of WIVIs to play orchestral material, I found that the built-in &quot;Symphony Hall&quot; reverb can muddy the sound more than I was comfortable with -- at least when left at its default settings.  For various reasons, I opted to disable the built-in reverb and use a combination of WaveArts MasterVerb and Voxengo Pristine Space reverbs.  This gives me a cleaner, more defined sound and lets me use the same reverb for non-WIVI parts of my orchestra.  (It&#039;s likely that by tweaking the WIVI reverb parameters I could also have improved the result, but this is something I haven&#039;t fully explored yet.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;/b&gt;  If you&#039;re just doing a casual demo, the default built-in reverb will come into play.  So I&#039;d suggest being wary of what this reverb might do to the instrument sound during your evaluation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;(3)&lt;/b&gt; You might not notice that, by default, WIVI vibrato depth is controlled by MIDI aftertouch messages.  Thus, if you have a keyboard that supports aftertouch, then when playing &quot;live&quot;, you can add vibrato simply by pressing harder on your keys.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And by the way, if you don&#039;t like the default sound, you can adjust various parameters to change it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;(4)&lt;/b&gt; Another detail that will almost certainly escape notice during an initial evaluation is the control WIVIs offer over note transitions -- i.e., more or less legato, portamento, etc.  This is another area where, if you&#039;re doing a quick initial evaluation and don&#039;t know how to control note transitions or even that they can be controlled, you might hear things that don&#039;t meet your expectations and conclude that WIVIs don&#039;t sound very good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In practice, I&#039;ve been finding that, for my taste, exerting control over note transitions is quite important.  At the moment, however, I&#039;m using far less of the note transition control capabilities than are available.  I simply assign the &quot;Transition CC&quot; parameter to be controlled by a MIDI continuous controller of my choice, and then set a CC value according to my taste in any given musical passage.  (I&#039;m generally doing this in my DAW.)  If you &lt;i&gt;don&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; alter the &quot;Transition CC&quot; parameter, your WIVI defaults to making transition speeds respond to key velocity.  My experience suggests that, for me, anyway, that&#039;s not such a good choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The relevant controls are found at the bottom of the &quot;Control Parameters&quot; section of the WIVI controls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;(5)&lt;/b&gt; Deane&#039;s most recent comment (above) includes specific mention of sample libraries he likes to use, and why he likes them.  I virtually worship Deane, but in trying to accomplish what I&#039;ve been interested in doing in recent months, I came to more or less the opposite conclusions.  It was disappointment with various aspects of those libraries that drove me to explore WIVI.  I don&#039;t yet know where I&#039;ll end up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finally ...&lt;/b&gt;  Thanks to everyone for the time taken to participate in this discussion!  As someone else (probably Deane) has said, the real action on SCOREcast Online is in the comments -- i.e., &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;!.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, keep the comments coming -- not only on this article, but on all of them.  Let&#039;s try to get this thing right!</description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following up on a few things &#8230;</p>
<p><b>(1)</b> In my exchange with William Arnold, I had said I thought recalled that WIVIs defaulted to using velocity as means of controlling playing amplitude.  William said he thought they defaulted to CC2 &#8212; breath control.  William was correct.</p>
<p>By the way, we&#39;re talking here about a WIVI parameter called &#8220;Breath CC&#8221;.  You find it in the &#8220;General Settings&#8221; group of WIVI controls, and it defaults to CC2.  You can set it to any continuous controller (CC), and you can also set it to VEL (velocity).  If you set it to a CC, WIVI note amplitude and timbre respond to changes in the CC value at <i>any</i> time.  If you set it to VEL, the amplitude and timbre of notes you play will respond to key velocity instead &#8212; but, true to the concept of key velocity, the amplitude and timbre are set at the beginning of the note and don&#39;t vary thereafter, so you lose an important component of expression.</p>
<p>Now, if you don&#39;t know about the WIVI&#39;s &#8220;Breath CC&#8221; parameter or don&#39;t change its setting from the default, the WIVI will be expecting you to vary CC2 as you play.</p>
<p><b>This is actually a very significant issue</b> for someone who is trying out WIVI for the first time!  If you don&#39;t realize what&#39;s going on,  the CC2 default will likely lead to a poor first impression of WIVIs.  Let me explain why.</p>
<p>CC2 is the default because WIVIs are intended to be used with breath control.  If you&#39;re playing &#8220;live&#8221;, it&#39;s best to be using an actual breath controller, like a Yamaha BC3.  (If you&#39;re not playing live, you can edit breath control contours in your DAW.)  But many people don&#39;t use breath controllers, and do most of their composing work with just a keyboard &#8212; the norm when working with sample libraries.  </p>
<p><b>The question is:  <i>How does a WIVI behave if you hook a keyboard up to it, don&#39;t have a breath controller, have left &#8220;Breath CC&#8221; set to CC2, and just start playing?</i></b></p>
<p><b>The answer is:  You&#39;ll have <i>no dynamics</i>!</b>  You touch your keyboard lightly, and you get a pretty hefty sound with more or less constant amplitude and pitch.  You bang hard on your keys, and you get the same thing!  That&#39;s because unless &#8220;Breath CC&#8221; is set to VEL, the WIVI pays no attention to key velocity!  <b>Beware!</b></p>
<p>Deane, this might have happened when you did your initial WIVI evaluation.  If so, it would have caused you to think WIVIs were pretty crude.</p>
<p><b>Bottom Line:</b>  If you&#39;re playing a WIVI &#8220;live&#8221;, with just a keyboard, set &#8220;Breath CC&#8221; to VEL.  This setting will give you some control over note dynamics.  You won&#39;t have the fantastic expressivity you can get with a breath controller &#8212; but what you get is much better much better than <i>no</i> control.</p>
<p><b>(2)</b> I mentioned in the article that the WIVI environment provides built-in reverb which is highly controllable.  I won&#39;t go into all the details here.  But I would like to point out that, when using an ensemble of WIVIs to play orchestral material, I found that the built-in &#8220;Symphony Hall&#8221; reverb can muddy the sound more than I was comfortable with &#8212; at least when left at its default settings.

		<description>As I read through my comment from above, I realize that maybe I was a little unclear in what I was trying to say. My basic overarching thought on WIVI, and ALL orchestral plugins for that matter, is that 99.9% of the time, you have to combine them with something else in order for them to really sound right in a mock-up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, when talking about *stock* libraries, my go-to plugin is the EastWest Quantum Leap Platinum stuff. For the kind of music I write, that bundle just sounds like the &quot;band&quot; that I&#039;ll most likely record with once we get to the stage. That being said, I still have to augment the EWQLSO stuff with other things to make it sound just the way I want it to. A lot of EQing has to go into some of the high woodwind patches and the brass often sounds &quot;boxy&quot; without any EQ applied to it. On the other hand, when I&#039;m in a hurry (which is quite often, unfortunately) the EWQLSO stuff sounds the best right out of the box of any orchestral bundle I have heard... and believe me, I&#039;ve heard them all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are a great programmer or a master technician (which I am *not*), then modeled plugins are great because you can really fine tune things to get exactly what you need from them. They are an exact scientific and mathematical representation of the real thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other point I want to make is on the heels of what William was saying earlier: Does a *real* orchestra sound like what people think it does? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I love the old John Ford quote, &quot;When fact becomes legend, print the legend.&quot; In the movies, a punch to the face sounds like a head of cabbage being chopped in half... because it is - and that is what people generally now think it sounds like when someone punches you in the nose! Is it the same with the orchestra? It is sad to wonder, but how many people of the Millennium Generation have ever sat in a live orchestral performance? Not too many, I wouldn&#039;t think. Combine that with the fact that the Millennium Generation is the first generation to have never known a world *without* digital music... and well, we have a hell of a problem if we are really worried about what the orchestra *should* sound like.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The big question for me in all this, and one I&#039;d love to hear from you SCOREcasters on, is &quot;Is it starting to not matter anyway what a *real* orchestra sounds like since people don&#039;t really know to begin with?&quot; To most moviegoers, I suspect an orchestra sounds like Johnny Depp with missing teeth and Kiera Knightly running around in a corset.</description>

		<description>It&#039;s a great idea, though tough to carry out given the number of variables involved.  I.e., ideally what you want is a sort of &quot;scientific experiment&quot;, in which you&#039;re careful to vary only one thing at a time so that it&#039;s possible to make valid conclusions about what caused a particular result to occur.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let&#039;s keep talking about how something like this could be done!</description>

		<description>Deane, your points are well taken.  And if the ultimate conclusion is that WIVI &lt;i&gt;isn&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; the answer, that&#039;s fine.  The way I see it, we&#039;ve opened things up to healthy debate here, and I think that&#039;s something SCOREcast should do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regarding the overall &lt;i&gt;efficiency&lt;/i&gt; of using WIVIs vs. something else, I have the same sort of concerns as you&#039;ve expressed (as I indicated in one of my earlier responses to William).  The main difference in our point of view is that I tend to mull things over for a long time before drawing conclusions, whereas you&#039;re able to reach the conclusion you need much more quickly (helps you be a great businessman!).  I still see the WIVI workflow issue as something needing more exploration.</description>

		<description>I confess, I haven&#039;t tried it out yet.  Sometime I would love for us to do a comparison- take a baseline piece of music- 30 seconds or something- and run it through EWQL, Vienna, WIVI, Garritan, whatever else is out there, and post (or podcast) the tunes side by side, with discussion.</description>

		<description>Lots of great info here on this topic! (And a little healthy debate, which I LOVE!) :op&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#039;ve followed this thread with great interest and have held back my opinions until I had time to check out the WIVI stuff on my own. Having done that last night and part of this morning, I can now weigh in with some sort of feeling that I know what I&#039;m talking about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is going to be one of those opinions that often gets me in trouble probably, but... I just don&#039;t hear it. In the WIVI stuff, I&#039;m just not hearing what I think is a true to life performance on any of those instruments. I understand completely the concept behind the function and design of the software, but the realism of these orchestral instruments does not come through to my ears. That&#039;s reason #1 as to why I probably am not a good buying candidate for something like this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reason #2 is the same reason I&#039;ve debated with Houston Haynes for years over another particular piece of software that he loves... and I don&#039;t. Houston is a mad scientist when it comes to audio gear. That guy has more talent in his pinky than I do in my whole body in regards to programming software. Fortunately, for him, this means that he is also uber quick at programming and re-setting parameters to achieve desired results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am the exact opposite. I do not have the time, nor the energy to beat my face against the wall for a better oboe sound. I just need a better oboe sound, and I need it NOW.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think this comes down to how much time you have to get your sounds together vs. what kinds of projects you are working on in your studio. I do a lot of TV and feature film writing, both of which force me to harness my time like a taskmaster from hell. I haven&#039;t got a spare minute to screw around with tweaking programs, building convo reverbs, or rewiring studio components. In fact, I have a guy that does a lot of that for me... not because I can, but because &quot;I can&#039;t&quot;. I don&#039;t have the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WIVI most certainly is like every other sample library/client I&#039;ve ever seen/heard... it takes more than what comes with it, whether by combining it with other software or by tweaking it into submission, in order to achieve network/studio-ready results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It will be tough, moving forward, to see any kind of plug-in or sampling architecture *not* go through extreme scrutiny on these SCOREcast boards. It&#039;s just inevitable that when you have this many people working on this many projects, we are all going to approach things differently. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe then, the question is, &quot;Is there a &#039;one-stop-shop&#039; orchestral plug-in that works for everything?&quot;</description>

		<description>I have Sample Modeling&#039;s &quot;The Trumpet&quot; and &quot;Mr. Sax T.&quot;.  I&#039;d say that these two are about the most incredible virtual instruments I have!

So why didn&#039;t I talk about them, instead of the WIVIs?  Because those two instruments are currently the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; ones Sample Modeling currently offers.  I needed a much more comprehensive solution, and WIVIs offer that -- despite not having strings yet.

Moreover, I&#039;ve tried putting three variants of Sample Modeling&#039;s trumpet together as a small ensemble.  I found it sounded much more &quot;phasey&quot; than I expected given that Sample Modeling provided variants so that you could create ensembles such as this.  Wallander seems to have a much better solution to being able to combine instruments.</description>

		<description>&quot;It is a synth ... but one that, theoretically, at least, can sound exactly like the real instrument that was analyzed when creating the model, if you give it equivalent input.&quot;

Yes, but it sounds like you&#039;re assuming Arne Wallander has accomplished the perfect model of some of these instruments. Just because he says he has, doesn&#039;t make it so! ;-)

As we both know, there are so many factors in the way a player produces sound on a given instrument. In fact, two players could play the same exact instrument and have a very different sound. 

Maybe the person he had play the instruments just sounds like a synth when they play! (just kidding)

You probably know that a lot of people prefer East West&#039;s products because they have more of a &quot;human&quot; sound that the company goes for on purpose. It&#039;s part of their philosophy, if I&#039;m not mistaken. This is as opposed to something like VSL that is considered to be more pristine, if you will. I guess my point is that when Wallander says he has reduced the sound of a given instrument to mathematics it&#039;s really kind of a subjective thing.

		<description>Well, most people have trouble distinguishing between the sound of instruments in general. Also, most people wouldn&#039;t be able to tell the difference between a WIVI flute, a patch on my Roland keyboard, or the real thing.

I&#039;m not doubting that those factors you speak of are important, however, in giving an instrument it&#039;s character. But I don&#039;t know that we can assume WIVI has accurately modeled these things. In fact I&#039;ve read other peoples&#039; complaints about the attack on the brass instruments, for example. They just don&#039;t have that punch that a real player produces when playing an accented note.

Again, it&#039;s not that I&#039;m opposed to the idea of sample modeling. I think it has promise. If you haven&#039;t already done so, check out a product called &quot;The Trumpet,&quot; for example:

http://www.samplemodeling.com/en/products_trumpet.php

I just don&#039;t think we can assume one company&#039;s models are perfect and blame the operators for not being able to make it work right! ;-)</description>

		<description>I can&#039;t find it now but I read an article a long time ago that studied sound recognition.  In the study they played certain instruments for people, and asked them what instrument it was.  They found that most respondents couldn&#039;t recognize the instrument playing a particular note, when they took away the &quot;attack&quot; and &quot;tail&quot; portions of the note.  For example, a clarinet just sounded roughly like a sine wave- they couldn&#039;t tell it was a clarinet.  As I remember it, I think one exception was instruments whose sound changed constantly, like piano and guitar.  I think this perception guides much of the real-instrument-vs-synth discussion, and this thread is a good example.  While the WIVI modeling may be perfect, if it&#039;s *played* in such a way that is out of sync with how our brains think a particular instrument sounds, or if only a couple critical parts of the waveform don&#039;t seem right, it doesn&#039;t ring true- even if the waveform is generated by a real musician (to Jim&#039;s point about how real instruments can sound synthy at times).  So the key is to pay attention to the things like attack, release tails, and so on, because that&#039;s where the &quot;oh it&#039;s that instrument&quot; information is.  And to vary the sound, even subtly, as much as possible, to give the listener&#039;s brain more information to chew on.</description>

		<description>William -- thanks for your comment!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I &lt;i&gt;almost&lt;/i&gt; turned away from WIVIs early on, after listening to the MP3 demos Wallander has on its site.  I didn&#039;t think they sounded very good.  That was before I actually started spending significant time working with them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It took some work before I got used to the way WIVIs work and became adept at getting good results with them.  For one thing, you really have to use the &lt;i&gt;breath controlled&lt;/i&gt; mode to get what WIVIs are capable of delivering, and not the velocity-controlled mode (which is the default).  That&#039;s not to say you have to use a hardware breath controller (although you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt;).  You can edit the control contours directly in your DAW.  That&#039;s what I&#039;m doing.  Along with the breath control trajectory, I usually also edit aftertouch (which, by default, controls vibrato depth), another CC I&#039;ve assigned to control vibrato frequency, and yet another CC that controls note transitions.  By playing with these things I can get very good results, so it&#039;s a matter of developing a workflow and a skill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the amazing thing is, you can throw together an ensemble of WIVIs just like you can throw together an ensemble of real musicians, and the combined result comes out sounding good.  Try that with samples and you&#039;re likely to be disappointed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I mentioned in the article, while I&#039;m happy with most of the WIVIs, I have some reservations about a few -- but I&#039;m not ready to draw my final conclusions on those yet, because I still have many features I haven&#039;t tried yet, and I think one or more of them might solve the problem.  I also have yet to discuss these problems in detail with Arne Wallander, who generally has provided great guidance and probably has some good ideas for me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bottom line for &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; is that WIVIs will definitely play an important part in my workflow and bag of tricks going forward.  I&#039;ll think I&#039;ve died and gone to heaven when WIVI strings comes out!</description>

		<description>I seem to remember that, out of the box, Breath CC was set to VEL.  That default would have been justified by realizing that most people would probably first hook up a keyboard and start playing.  But from what you&#039;ve said, I probably got that recollection wrong.</description>

		<description>I really &lt;i&gt;appreciate&lt;/i&gt; hearing your views, William!  I, too, am expressing opinions, and we don&#039;t have to end up with the same view.

In my &lt;i&gt;opinion&lt;/i&gt;, the sound is great right out of the box for at least some of the instruments if you use breath control mode.  Here&#039;s how I&#039;d explain that:

When you use breath control, the amplitude and timbre change continuously with the controller value, rather than only at the note boundaries.  If you don&#039;t use breath control, and use velocity instead, what happens is more or less equivalent to setting the breath value at the beginning of the note and holding it constant for the duration of the note.  I.e., more or less like a synth played without any continuous controllers.  (It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a synth ... but one that, theoretically, at least, can sound exactly like the real instrument that was analyzed when creating the model, if you give it equivalent &lt;i&gt;input&lt;/i&gt;.  The input is crucial!)  I agree that any synth sounds pretty bad if you play it this way, and WIVIs are no different.  In fact, &lt;i&gt;even the real instrument would also sound pretty awful, and very &quot;synthy&quot;, if played this way&lt;/i&gt;!  To get something that sounds right, you need to use breath control and sometimes other continuous controllers -- the equivalent of what you&#039;d do if playing the real instrument.  

It then sounds even better when you combine instruments into ensembles.  I think this is aptly demonstrated by the &quot;Polyphonic Mode&quot; demo I mentioned (though you don&#039;t have to use polyphonic mode to create WIVI ensembles).

No question that &lt;i&gt;Symphobia&lt;/i&gt; is a great product, and got even greater with Version 1.1.  I&#039;m using it myself.  (I have to say, however, I often feel guilty when I use it, like I&#039;m cheating ...).  I think there&#039;s a good argument to be made that if you&#039;re happy with the level of flexibility Symphobia gives you and you&#039;re not too worried about your orchestrations sounding like those of every other Symphobia owner, using it can save you a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of time.  That&#039;s valuable when you&#039;re trying to earn a buck.

In fact, my views are somewhat colored by where I am in my development as a composer.  Right now, I&#039;m very interested in combining individual instruments and seeing what happens.  WIVIs let me do that.  But I have to do a lot of tweaking at the level of individual instruments.  Can I work effectively as a commercial composer that way?  I have a lot of doubts -- but this is something that&#039;s still a work in progress.  I&#039;m sharing my thoughts and observations as they happen.</description>

		<description>P.S. I want to clarify what you mean about using breath-controlled mode. When I open it up it automatically sets &quot;Breath CC&quot; to #2. I then control the sound of the instruments through a dial set to that CC on my keyboard, not based on velocity. Is that what you&#039;re talking about or am I missing something?

EDIT: Never mind...I see now how you can switch it to work based off of velocity. Yeah, I&#039;ve definitely used it with a CC, although never tried it with an actual breath controller.</description>

		<description>But what about just the raw sound? Are you saying you have to tweak a lot just to make an individual instrument sound like the real thing? I was just playing around with some of the woodwinds with the demo version and to me they sound quite synthy. I know Arne swears they are mathematically correct, but there&#039;s somehow something missing to my ears.

The whole thing with tweaking a lot of parameters would be a good topic for discussion in and of itself. I think I would prefer (if I could afford it) the way a product like Symphobia sounds good right out of the box. Yes, I understand the limitations involved...especially with Symphobia in particular...but the point is that you don&#039;t have to work nearly as hard to get a great sounding final product...especially if your final goal is to NOT record with live players.

Anyway, just expressing my opinion. I know many people swear by WIVI and many, like me, aren&#039;t quite convinced. I DO think the concept is a great one, though. I even think their GUI is ver cool looking!</description>

		<description>James --  Thanks for the feedback!

It would have been nice to have embedded some audio examples in the present article.  I&#039;ve done the next best thing -- provided links to some very interesting demos.

To make for some very interesting multi-way discussions, it would also be cool to be able to embed audio in comments.

How about the rest of you readers?  Is this something really important for us to do?  AND ... is this type of article useful to you?</description>

<p>It would have been nice to have embedded some audio examples in the present article.  I&#8217;ve done the next best thing &#8212; provided links to some very interesting demos.</p>

		<description>Great information Jim!  I had never heard of this product before; not sure if this means I&#039;m just that clueless or if you&#039;re just that awesome.

I think it&#039;s about time to consider how we may embed audio and/or video into an article.

I have a similar experience with Omnisphere, although Omni doesn&#039;t market itself as a &quot;realistic&quot; palette.  Still it&#039;s nice (and pretty amazing) to have some of these really great sounding patches load up in a fraction of the time of sample-based patches.</description>
