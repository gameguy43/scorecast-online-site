Nothing will give your music heart, soul, the real human touch, better than the sounds of skilled musicians. Even if you yourself are the finest, with years of experience, even adding just one pro player will double your firepower, and even casual listeners will notice.</p>
<p>So, now that you are off the phone and someone is on his or her way, it&#8217;s time to think about just how to interact for the best possible results. This is where you will be called on to put on your &#8220;producer&#8221; hat. Let&#8217;s talk about what that entails.</p>
<p><strong>Producers In Different Music Types</strong><br />
Most of us are aware of the job of producer, or at least that most professional music projects require one. In the case of pop album artists, the producer is often someone different than the artist, a specialist who may have many years of experience and credits with a variety of performers. As the overall guide and leader of a project, the producer starts at the beginning with an artist with some sort of raw talent, and sees the recording project all the way to the successful delivery of a finished master recording. Along the way, he or she is called to be a scheduler, accountant, arranger, songwriter or writing partner, guide to the technical details of the studio process, psychologist and counselor, negotiator, liaison with the client (record company, etc.) supervisor of the artists and musicians who may perform, player/programmer, overseer of mixing, and (hopefully) all-round highly skilled musician with the ability and experience to see the project through to its completed stage.</p>
<p>Like I said, in the record industry, that person is often a hired specialist, separate from the artist. In the score music business, that person is generally &#8230; YOU, the composer.</p>
<p>What are some of the issues you&#8217;ll need to keep your eyes and ears on as a guest musician performs on your score? Some examples:</p>
<p><strong>Being Prepared</strong><br />
Obviously you&#8217;ll start with some idea of how long you want the musician to work, and how many cues you want played. (This has a lot to do with budget, of course.) In order to make the best use of time, you want to make sure that you have well-copied, legible music written out. Even if you intend to record an improvised part, a simple chart with bar numbers, sections indicated, and chord changes, will help everybody navigate. If you&#8217;re not sure about your copyist skills, it&#8217;s worth asking a friend to help or at least proofread. One of the most unnecessary and disastrous time wasters is for a musician to try to make sense out of a part that is illegible, poorly formatted, or contains mistakes.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t just assume that, since your sequencing program has a notation printing function, that it will automatically come out good enough. I have yet to see software automatically format the chart in the best professional way; some hands-on manipulating always makes it better. If you&#8217;re not sure what real professional copying is supposed to look like, that&#8217;s a topic that might be worth looking for at a local school of music. Just because copying now is almost always done with software rather than pen and ink, doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s an obsolete skill — formatting and layout make a big difference. Or, like I said, get some help.</p>
<p><strong>How Long Will It Take?</strong><br />
Once your musicians are on the clock, you&#8217;ll want to make the most efficient use of time possible. Ahead of time, you might want to plan out how many minutes of music, or how many cues, you would like to get accomplished each hour. For orchestral recording, the music union has guidelines of how many minutes of music should be recorded per hour, so that at least gives a general notion to start with. It takes some experience to learn to set realistic goals with this sort of thing, so how do you get started? Just dive in, and take meticulous notes, and you&#8217;ll learn. If things are moving more quickly than you expect, then great; if they&#8217;re going slower than you hoped, try to figure out why. Are the charts playable? Are they neatly copied? Are they in the comfortable range of the instrument? And is this particular player capable of doing what you were hoping? Figuring out how to assess all these factors is part of the learning process.</p>
<p>Take notes and keep records! One producer/composer I work with has over 30 years experience in recording the best players and singers, but to this day he still carefully writes down in a database exactly what happened and how long it took with each musician&#8217;s name and with each project. There&#8217;s no way everything can always be perfectly predictable, but the more you do it, the better you&#8217;ll have a sense of what to expect, and as your knowledge increases you&#8217;ll be able to confidently tackle bigger projects.</p>
<p><strong>Judging Performance Quality: When Is It Good Enough?</strong><br />
From my chair as engineer, over the years I&#8217;ve observed a lot of producers, and made my own (private) judgments. I&#8217;ve seen some be simply too picky, redoing little things when it was already good enough, which can drain the energy and enthusiasm out of musicians. Others (perhaps a bit intimidated by the process) might leave things a little more sloppy than necessary. It&#8217;s okay to ask for a retake if you think it can or must be a better performance. Often a savvy and helpful musician will say &#8220;I think I can do that better; how about saving that and then giving me another chance?&#8221; And especially with improvising, you might want to save more than one choice, and pick or comp later. Today with digital recording, there are basically infinite numbers of tracks. But (maybe from my past experience with analog tape) I never think it&#8217;s worthwhile to save garbage. Judge as you go along; why wait to sort through tons of stuff later?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget, there such a thing as musician fatigue. Both the chops and the brain get tired, and it&#8217;s standard practice to give a 10-minute break each hour. And at some point every musician will be &#8220;cooked&#8221; for the day. Especially with a passage that might be difficult, even the finest musician might say, &#8220;I have one or two of these in me; make sure you get it recorded well!&#8221; Never embarrass yourself by having to admit that the perfect take was distorted or you forgot to hit &#8220;save&#8221;. (Too much to think about to produce and also mind the technicalities of recording? Let me tell you about a full-time highly skilled professional specialist called a Recording Engineer&#8230;)</p>
<p><strong>Singers and Vocals</strong><br />
Although it&#8217;s somewhat less likely for a composer to use a singer on a score than in other types of music, it&#8217;s often done, and worthy of special mention. There&#8217;s something very intimate about the act of singing into a microphone. It seems especially emotional, and singers wear their hearts on their sleeves. It really takes a bit of a psychologist to get the best performance out of anybody, but especially a singer. Don&#8217;t forget, one of the most important things you can do is dish out praise, even when you&#8217;re not quite sure it&#8217;s deserved. You don&#8217;t want to come across like a phony-baloney, but you do want to convince performers that you&#8217;re there for them, and create an environment where they will feel safe doing their best and giving their all.</p>
<p>Even singers who read well (and not all do) have an element of improvising in expressive performance. Don&#8217;t be so hung up on your previously imagined ideas, or the way you would sing it if you could, that you fail to recognize something unexpected that might be great. One time I was there (keeping my mouth shut) while one of the most powerful producers in the business, a name you&#8217;d recognize immediately, reduced a fine singer to tears by rejecting everything he did, and instead singing his own version into the talkback mic over and over. Even though that man has written some of the best pop songs ever, I lost respect for him, because of his poor people skills in that situation. Keep your ears wide open, and don&#8217;t forget that one of the reasons you&#8217;ve hired great musicians or singers is to collaborate with them, and to get their best ideas for your music.</p>
<p><strong>Cutting Your Losses / Heroic Saves</strong><br />
Okay, sometimes it&#8217;s just not happening. I once watched a composer valiantly trying to get the right kind of loping easy country feel on a fiddle melody. One after another, several players took a stab at it, were politely thanked (and paid), and then, after they left, I was told to erase their parts while he frantically phoned the next one. If this happens, yes, you&#8217;ll take a bit of a bath, but you&#8217;ll also learn something, and it won&#8217;t be your last time ever producing a soloist or having money to spend.</p>
<p>Of course we&#8217;ve got a lot of tools in our computers these days that can help turn a marginal performance into an acceptable one, and maybe even a great one. As a matter of principle, I hate Autotune, but it&#8217;s a devil we all live with these days, put to use cleaning up performances both ordinary and even superlative. For example, a good studio singer can usually get a track in two or three passes — the first is for reading and learning, and then the emotion kicks in and you better have the machine in record. Then if you say, “That&#8217;s great but the last two notes were flat”, then they start thinking too much and lose the spark. Better to just tune it up a bit. (Yes, I&#8217;ve gone over to the dark side, with the rest of you!)</p>
<p>Likewise, digital editing and even quantizing of rhythmic parts are possible in almost all the major software packages. But, if you&#8217;re on a deadline, hopefully you won&#8217;t have to spend all night cleaning a part that should have been done right to start with!</p>
<p><strong>How To Learn</strong><br />
One of the best ways to get an idea of what it&#8217;s like to work with studio musicians, either in a studio or home setting, is to get a chance to watch someone else do it. This is where it comes in handy to be in touch with other working composers — ask around and see if someone will let you be a &#8220;fly on the wall&#8221; in one of their sessions. Or, better yet, find some way to help: set up person, copyist, make tea, etc.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in the Los Angeles area, a good organization that offers some of these kinds of observing and mentoring experiences is the <a href="http://www.thescl.com/" target="_blank">Society of Composers and Lyricists</a>. Their &#8220;<a href="http://thescl.com/mentor_program" target="_blank">Mentor Program</a>&#8221; offers young composers a chance to sit in on sessions with working composers, observe, and ask questions.</p>
<p>By fortunate coincidence, the annual meeting of the SCL is coming up very soon, Wednesday evening October 6, 2010, in Hollywood. See the website for more details. For those attending, the price of admission will be credited towards annual dues if you sign up, and there is a discount rate for students. And you’re likely to meet at least one <em>SCOREcaster</em> there. Don&#8217;t miss it!</p>

Even if you&#8217;re great in whatever you do but with no people skills, you suck. But on the other hand you said he has written the greatest pop songs ever. which means this dude knows his craft better than anyone. His ears, his vision, his attention to detail and emotion is of greatness. I would just be humble and learn as much as i could in a situation like that, make me cry shoot!!!.<br />
On a third hand there are also great singers that you cant tell how to sing&#8230;personal experience. Again, its all about attitude!!!</p>
