		<description><![CDATA[Many might argue that Hollywood is more concerned these days about having "hit films" than it is about creating successful ones. What's the difference?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p>What kind of &#8220;professional&#8221; walks out on a film set to start production in less than two weeks?James Franco does, that&#8217;s who. That&#8217;s right. After already spending half a million on pre-production just weeks away from shooting, James Franco pulled out of GARDEN OF LAST DAYS, a film he was directing and starring in. The reason? According to Mike Flemming at <em>Deadline Hollywood:</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Franco’s exit had to do with a disagreement with financier Millennium over the crew he wanted to hire. Basically, Franco put together a crew that didn’t &#8220;have the experience&#8221; to get approval from the bond company. Millennium wouldn’t approve his choices.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p>There are a couple different ways to interpret what happened. I realize we are armchair quarterbacking this and not privy to exactly what happened. But think about it with me for a moment. One possible scenario is that Millennium just did not want to do the project any more out of their fear it would lose money and they quietly, under the table, told the bond company to not approve the crew. This would allow them to save the relationship with their star Franco and blame the film not happening on the faceless bond company. That is a possibility. Also&#8230;I am told the bond company does not really care if the film is good&#8230;just if the film can be done on the budget laid out. It is possible the $3M budgeted was certain to go way over budget and the crew assembled did not have the experience to navigate a tight budget. They most likely met with everyone they would have been concerned about&#8230; and discovered the way they are wanting to shoot, there would be no way they were going to only spend $3M. The bond company estimation could have been much higher to finish the film Franco wanted to make and so determined his crew didn&#8217;t know how to be efficient with their choices. That is also possible for sure. But part of me thinks something else may be going on.</p>
<p>James Franco is a rather talented guy who has shown his talent both in front of and behind the camera. He also is someone in this industry who I would consider to be a true &#8220;artist&#8221;. I have always felt he is creating art when he works. He takes chances. He works on both indies and Blockbusters. He breaks barriers. And he has also finally earned the respect of many in Hollywood as an &#8220;A-list&#8221; actor. There is little doubt he knows what he is doing when it comes to making a successful film. So why would a studio/bond company trust him enough to hire him as a director, but not trust his choices for his crew?</p>
<p>I was speaking with a director/producer friend of mine.  He is an active AMPAS member, respected by his peers, and use to be a studio executive in addition to his producing work. So he has been on both sides of the process of making and releasing a film. He knows what he is talking about. He shared with me a profound concept that explains how to interpret what is going on in Hollywood here. And he learned it from Hal Prince, an American theatrical producer and director who has worked on many of the best-known Broadway musical productions of the past 50 years. Hal has garnered twenty-one Tony Awards, more than any other individual, including eight for directing, eight for producing the year&#8217;s Best Musical, two as Best Producer of a Musical and three special awards. Cabaret, West Side Story, Cats, Evite, Phantom Of The Opera. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Hal said there is a difference between a &#8220;Hit&#8221; &amp; a &#8220;Flop&#8221; and a &#8220;Success&#8221; &amp; a &#8220;Failure.&#8221; One set of terms has to do with money&#8230;the other does not.</p>
<p>A <em><strong>hit</strong></em> makes money. Lots of money.<br />
A <em><strong>flop</strong></em> does not.</p>
<p>A <em><strong>success</strong></em> is not tied to money but whether if it is successful in what it set out to do. (Tell a compelling story, entertain, etc&#8230;)<br />
A <em><strong>failure</strong></em> is unsuccessful in completing its goals.</p>
<p>How does this apply to Hollywood today? Many might argue that Hollywood is more concerned these days about having &#8220;hit films&#8221; than it is about creating film successes. A hit does not necessarily have to be a successful film. In fact, I would argue many hits today are not very successful films. How many times have you gone to see the latest blockbuster film and left the theater saying to yourself, &#8220;that was just not a good film.&#8221; And yet it made millions at the box office opening weekend. It was a hit. But as a film&#8230;it was a failure. Disney&#8217;s <em>John Carter</em> is a recent example many considered to be in the flop category. They did take a $200M write down on the film after all and Rich Ross resigned from his position at Disney over it.</p>
<p>On the contrary, there are many films that were extremely successful, but flops at the box office. Going back a bit into the 90&#8217;s, <em>Pleasantville</em> completely changed how the industry worked in Post-Production. A change still in effect today.  It was the first film to use a Digital Intermediate throughout the entire Post process for its groundbreaking color effects. Previous to this, the digital intermediate was used sparingly for FX shots only. Most people I know love the film and all of those associated with the film are very well-respected in Hollywood for their work on that film. It was truly a success in everything it set out to do and changed Hollywood for the better. But financially at the box office it was actually a flop.</p>
<h2>A New Paradigm</h2>
<p>We have to recognize that the financiers and studios today are much more interested in hits than successes. Despite his proven track record of success in film, Franco still could not get his chosen crew to get approved on this little $3 million dollar indie film. This is not hundreds of millions of dollars we are talking about here, but a very low budgeted $3M indie. And Millennium Films, according Deadline Hollywood, would apparently not approve his flop of a crew. Reading between the lines, I keep coming back to the thought that just because some on the crew had not made a $100M dollar hit film, does that necessarily mean they don&#8217;t know what they are doing on a $3M indie film? No. It doesn&#8217;t. The next Tariq Anwar (Editor &#8211; <em>The King&#8217;s Speech, American Beauty</em>), Freddie Young (Cinematographer &#8211; <em>Lawrence Of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago</em>) or Jerry Goldsmith could be among that young crew.</p>
<p>I continue to speculate here, but does anyone really think James Franco would be putting a crew together for a film he was reportedly passionate about that could not pull off what he wanted to do with this little indie? I don&#8217;t. I think the true artist in James was putting together the exact crew perfect to make THAT film&#8230;and yet because some of them were not on the Millennium short list of dept. heads in town, the financiers and bond company (who are experts at the numbers game and not artists and filmmakers) got nervous and began to butt heads with Franco. They did not trust him and his directing choices and probably lost interest in the project and were concerned it would be a flop.  Whether Millennium put the bond company up to not approving the project or not, we will never know. But Franco, out of true loyalty to his film&#8217;s vision and his chosen crew that he believed in, simply walked away. Proving to those around him that there is more to this business than making a hit.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong: The hits <em>are</em> important. They help the studio&#8217;s fund other productions. They <em>must</em> have hits. But if Hollywood is going to start making successful original films again, the films that will become iconic and remembered for generations to come, it is going to have to stop putting a &#8220;hit requirement&#8221; on everything it produces and take more chances across the board on both original stories and young, talented people. Especially the $3M indies like Franco&#8217;s GARDEN OF LAST DAYS and other &#8220;entry-level films&#8221; that are the proving grounds for the future generation of filmmakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&#8230;as composers..how does this apply to us,&#8221; you ask? Well, if you have never had a &#8220;hit&#8221; film&#8230;that does not mean you are not a successful composer. It does not mean you don&#8217;t know what you are doing or talking about. It means the folks out there that may be saying that are confused about the difference between a hit &amp; a flop and a success &amp; a failure. They are not the same. They are exclusive of one another. As a composer, you need to simply focus on making every film score you work on a success and stop worrying about whether it is attached to a hit. Does your music make the film better? Does it do its job well? Did you write a successful score? That is what you should be focusing on.</p>
<p>Hal Prince had it right.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Contemplating moving to Los Angeles for a career in film music? Here are composer Mark Smythe's observations...]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been in Los Angeles since early March 2013 on an Australia Council-funded mentorship program, absorbing all things film music and SoCal: The Good, The Bad and The Bellicose. These are my reflections so far.</p>
<h2>Transit Tantrums</h2>
<p>LA traffic on Thursday afternoon is slower than a George R. R. Martin novel&#8230;and in my case on a shuttle ride, just as gob-smacking when something finally happened. Two young girls in front were chatting excitedly about their impending adventure. Now, they weren&#8217;t exactly shrill but the conversation was audible to all. 40 minutes in, a baby-boomer businessman had an explosive outburst: &#8220;We DON&#8217;T CARE about your banal existence!&#8221;&#8230;stunned silence. A whimpered response. Simmering tension until they were dropped off&#8230;at the same hotel as Mr Explosion and his embarrassed wife. Welcome to Hollywood, girls!</p>
<p>I went to <a href="http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/bmi_participates_in_first_southeast_film_music_symposium" target="_blank">Chattanooga</a> for a weekend, as you do. I had a dawn flight out of LAX so stayed at an airport hotel the night before. Passed the concierge as a man was SCREAMING HIS HEAD OFF at a cab driver for apparently ripping him off all of $9. He kept threatening to call the cops but finally backed down.</p>
<p>On LAX-CHA flight 1, the overhead lockers filled up and a bunch of people had to check their bags through to final destinations, including myself. I didn&#8217;t care; all I needed was my iPad and headphones. Others <em>did care</em> &#8211; airline staff were hammered by well-heeled women with an inflated sense of entitlement, indignant that they wouldn&#8217;t have access to their L&#8217;Oreal travel kits and Xanax.</p>
<p>Then there was the 4-hour delay in Charlotte due to the incoming plane having &#8216;mechanical issues&#8217;. Initially it was 1 hour, then 2&#8230;etc. Was it annoying? Yes. Did it warrant the ageing rocker with a gig that night having an absolute meltdown at the check-in girl, to the point that once again the police were mentioned? NO. I wasn&#8217;t overly happy myself, but would much rather be delayed than fall out of the sky. And for a while there it did feel like the precursor to an episode of &#8216;Air Crash Investigations&#8217;.</p>
<p>SO &#8211; my point is, this was very early into my visit and I was thinking &#8216;holy crap, is this REALLY what Americans are like?&#8217; NO IT ISN&#8217;T. The symposium was FANTASTIC and when I returned to LA, the perpetually warm glow of Angelenos restored my societal faith. I guess travel brings out the best/worst in anyone and I saw some doozies of the latter kind. 99.9% of Americans are nice, genuinely interested in foreigners and usually mean it when they say &#8220;what can I do to help?&#8221;. Embrace that percentile.</p>
<h2>Location/Vehiculation</h2>
<p>Something anyone new to to town should consider carefully, well before landing. Unlike Melbourne, where I could walk 5 minutes to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Fawkner Park or my local cafe strip, LA isn&#8217;t <em>really</em> a city. Rather, it&#8217;s a vast sprawl of mini-cities connected by a web of freeways, each enclave having a unique flavour that may or may not suit your taste. Santa Monica and Venice are renowned for their beach lifestyle and slightly cooler air, but if most of your stuff&#8217;s happening Downtown or in The Valley, you&#8217;ll spend an awful lot of time on the road if you&#8217;re based out west. I knew I&#8217;d be hanging in Studio City/ Hollywood a lot, so took the time to find and pre-book the perfect AirBNB rental, smack in the middle. Slightly pricey but the location definitely saved me time and money. If AirBNB-style pads are beyond your budget, the ubiquitous CRAIGSLIST is a great place to find sub-lets, especially during summer holidays.</p>
<p>Mode of transport is a no-brainer. Unless you have incredibly helpful friends going to Point B (which I actually often do) or don&#8217;t mind spending hours traversing multi Metro routes, <em><strong>you need a car</strong></em>. If you have no choice but to get a cab somewhere, KNOW THIS: They&#8217;ll take at least 20 minutes to turn up, cost a lot and woe betide the passenger that dares to pay by credit card – even if your cab-finder app says it&#8217;s cool. I had a heated argument with a driver about this very point; in the end he was only placated when I tipped cash. If you don&#8217;t want to drive on a night out, a far better option is <a href="http://www.lyft.me" target="_blank">LYFT</a>: a smartphone app that uses your location to find and order a driver in minutes, is 20% cheaper, 100% friendlier and automatically calculates a tip-inclusive fare – ONLY from your credit card. Ok, so they have weird pink moustaches on the cars, but most drivers also stock water and snack treats : )</p>
<h2>LA Flakers — A Few Bad Players or a Team Malaise?</h2>
<p>Much has been said and written about the notoriously slow/complete lack of follow through here in Tinseltown; one friend even suggested that &#8216;yes means maybe, maybe means no and people never say no&#8217;. Hackneyed phrases are quoted with mirth by the cheerfully cynical: “let&#8217;s do lunch” &#8211; ”we&#8217;ll talk” &#8211; etc. Well. I made a conscious decision to ignore the cliché and decide for myself what the deal is. Consequently, I&#8217;ve been very surprised by the reality:</p>
<h3>Those Who&#8217;ve Flaked:</h3>
<p>&#8211; Old Aussie friends now based here, who wanted things from me on a social/industry/material level (they got 2 of the 3) but gave nothing back. Even after I said “You&#8217;re not going to flake on me are you, we will catch up?” I tried to follow up. Twice. We never caught up, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if I suddenly hear from them just before their next gig.<br />
&#8211; Potential new LA friends via Bookface; they were going to &#8216;reach out&#8217; one weekend&#8230;back in March. I tried to follow up. Twice. They de-friended me. Maybe my dry humour was misconstrued when I sent a link to that Four Tops track.</p>
<h3>Those Who Haven&#8217;t Flaked:</h3>
<p>&#8211; New composer friends, including very busy ones working on high-rating shows.<br />
&#8211; Everyone in the industry I&#8217;ve emailed/left a message for, including those I don&#8217;t know that well or haven&#8217;t met yet. I did wait 3 weeks for one reply, but this was a new contact and I time-budgeted accordingly.</p>
<p>So – I&#8217;ve been mildly affected by flakelenos at social level, but industry/music folks have treated me with more than a modicum of politeness and respect. Maybe because I haven&#8217;t burdened myself with unrealistic expectations or exuded the desperate &#8216;I want something from you&#8217; vibe that you can smell a mile away from so many young aspirants. If you come here thinking you&#8217;ll reach the summit straight away, THAT is flakey. Ed Hilary completed his first major climb 13 YEARS before scaling Everest. Patience, persistence and prudence, my friends&#8230;</p>
<h2>Event Etiquette</h2>
<p>Outside of my mentorship with <a href="http://jeffcardoni.com" target="_blank">Jeff Cardoni</a> (CSI:Miami, Wilfred) I&#8217;ve attended a swag (Australian vernacular) of workshops, screenings, seminars and masterclasses. Each event has featured high calibre composers, orchestrators, conductors, directors, or moderators and has been well conceived. Sadly, I can&#8217;t say the same for some of the <em>questions</em> that inevitably slip through the relevance cordon at these things. IT&#8217;S NOT ABOUT YOU! Do you really think that standing up so that everyone can see you when you say &#8220;Hi, my name&#8217;s [wannabe composer X] and I&#8217;ve been working on/done a lot of [gratuitous promo Y] and I work in [DAW Z],&#8221; will make them think <em>&#8220;Wow, I&#8217;m really interested in this guy and what he does, he must write like me because he uses DAW Z&#8221;</em>&#8230;? Truth is, by the time you&#8217;ve got to the actual question, half the room has tuned out (or in my case, head in hands) and the A-lister will remember your face for all the wrong reasons when you push your way through the post-event throng. Then there are those that ask questions just to be &#8216;involved&#8217; and &#8216;seen&#8217;, even if they&#8217;re &#8220;just a songwriter&#8221;&#8230;and you seriously want to punch them when they ask Thomas Newman if he &#8220;scores to picture&#8221;. Or the guy that asked Aaron Zigman if he &#8220;hums ideas in the shower&#8221;. Come on people! Be enthusiastic, but don&#8217;t be a wanker.</p>
<h2>Weeding Out the Tall Poppy</h2>
<p>Australians and New Zealanders are not known for overt self-promotion. In fact, those that say &#8220;I&#8217;m a big deal&#8221; are more often than not regarded as wankers and ostracised by their peers. This is the <strong><em>Tall Poppy Syndrome</em></strong> at work – a &#8216;cut them down&#8217; attitude towards high achievers that is uniquely endemic to Australasia. When I was younger and just out of film music school, I was brimming with enthusiasm; thrilled with any work I could get and any composer I met. Said enthusiasm combined with the mild hero-worship of a composer I spent time with somehow lead to me being perceived as a &#8216;name-dropper&#8217; by a high-ranking person in the Australian film music world. Fast forward four years to the Australian Screen Music Awards, which I was invited to by the organisation this person works for. At an industry lunch prior to the ceremony I made a concerted effort to have a pleasant conversation with this person. But when I told her I was looking forward to the awards, she asked “Are you attending legitimately?”</p>
<p>Happily, my experiences in LA have been the complete opposite. Here, it&#8217;s okay to talk about what you&#8217;ve done, what you&#8217;re doing, who you&#8217;ve connected with and what your aims are. I&#8217;ve been doing so with complete openness and honesty over the last 3 months and have been treated with more respect than I ever was in Australia. In fact, one delightful Executive Director (who holds a comparable position to my antipodean nemesis) now refers to me as her &#8216;favourite Kiwi&#8217;. And you know what? I can write about my awesome night at <a href="http://www.jeffbeal.com" target="_blank">Jeff Beal</a>&#8216;s place without fear of someone telling everybody I&#8217;ve been blowing my own trumpet. I can mention the <a href="http://www.hmmawards.org" target="_blank">Hollywood Music in Media Awards</a> competition I won &#8211; a scoring session with Mr. Beal; helping him record a 25-piece string orchestra. I can say that we exchanged CDs and that he particularly likes my choral stuff.</p>
<p>Los Angeles certainly takes some getting used to, but it&#8217;s so worth it. The top film music people I&#8217;ve met genuinely embrace talent, passion and commitment when they see it.</p>
<p>This, above all, makes me want to stick around.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Your artistic quality has been called into question. And it hurts. Might be true, might not be... but from time to time every artist, no matter the discipline, needs to check the 'ol barometer.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The film music culture over the years has a developed a bit of an elitist complex in the way we talk about the artform, leading some to believe that if you don&#8217;t have little black dots as prevalent as you have red blood cells in your veins then you must not be trying very hard. After all, we were born with this, right? It&#8217;s in our DNA.</p>
<p>Arguable, at best. A lot of people say we were born with certain aptitudes toward this gig but I would argue that while that might be true about musical intuition and a predisposition toward cognitive retention of scales  and other functional repeating mathematical sequences, quality skilled composition only comes out of tireless practice, varied experience and loads of trial and error. It&#8217;s not a far-flung theory then to assume that there could be a serious self-esteem issue working against emerging composers, dare I say even veteran ones who are willing to admit the ugly truth. Are we <em>Weenies</em>? <em>Wimps</em>? <em>Candie-asses</em>? I don&#8217;t think so. But we <em>are</em> human beings and from time to time every artist, no matter the discipline, needs to check the &#8216;ol barometer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>You&#8217;re Not a Bad Composer</h1>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you can&#8217;t seem to write anything today.</strong></h3>
<p>Writer&#8217;s block sucks. But even though the cool thing to say is &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time for that&#8221;, that still doesn&#8217;t mean it never happens. The truth is that it does happen&#8230; to everybody. You aren&#8217;t a bad composer if you are not able to write for whatever reason. You might be a <em>late</em> composer, but you aren&#8217;t a bad one.</p>
<p>How to get rid of it? Studies show that stress is the leading cause of &#8220;mental blocking&#8221; and that eliminating stress-related activities or events in your life can also lower your chances of stalling out creatively. Want to drill down further? Those same studies show that the number one cause of stress, at least among Americans, is <em>finances</em>. If that means something to you&#8230; get on it. Scale back, pare down, save more, spend less, slash and burn, budget hard, charge more — whatever you need to do, but get that financial monkey off your back, and fast. It&#8217;s a killer. Literally.</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you don&#8217;t understand the theories behind music in film.</strong></h3>
<p>It just means you have a few things to learn if you are to be as effective a film music writer as you can be. You might already be an effective composer, but as a film composer you have to intimately understand the marriage of music and drama. If you don&#8217;t, then you are missing a huge piece of the puzzle as a talented composer looking to crack this particular medium. Obviously you aren&#8217;t a bad composer if this skill still eludes you, but I&#8217;ll warn you that without it you are always going to be composing from a <em>defensive</em> posture — meaning that whatever is thrown at you, you&#8217;ll either need to be lucky enough to intuitively feel it and magically hit that bullseye on the first dart throw or you&#8217;ll need to study up every time out, whether that&#8217;s through asking seasoned vets or &#8220;listening&#8221; to seasoned vets via Netflix streaming. Point being, you&#8217;ll always be playing &#8220;catch up&#8221;. That game gets old fast, slows you down, and eventually begins to erode your confidence.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t worry&#8230; it&#8217;s an easy fix. All you have to do is find a way to absorb the principles and theories behind drama. Extended viewing and note-taking can do it, but so will auditing a few film appreciation courses at the local community college. Or reading a stack of good books on the subject. I&#8217;d recommend starting with Earle Hagen&#8217;s <a href="http://amzn.com/0882844474" target="_blank"><em>Advanced Techniques for Film Scoring</em></a>. Hagen&#8217;s book is grossly outdated in its purview of technology, but the score analysis and score/script interaction is second to none. If you really want to steam your head, pick up Fred Karlin&#8217;s classic brick of a book <a href="http://amzn.com/0415941369" target="_blank"><em>On the Track</em></a>. Often referred to as &#8220;the film scoring bible&#8221;, <em>On the Track</em> offers probably the most extensive perspective on various approaches to dramatic writing for the medium of film.</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you&#8217;ve been rejected, fired or ignored. A lot.</strong></h3>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean you suck. Not necessarily, anyway. Although, a case could be made that if you got so far as to pitch for the gig it won&#8217;t matter if you suck anyway because you obviously have what it takes to get through the door. Any well-heeled major player knows <em>that ain&#8217;t easy</em>. But being told that &#8220;your music just isn&#8217;t what we&#8217;re looking for&#8221; is tough. What&#8217;s tougher, though, is hearing that time and again. And even still, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you are a bad composer. You&#8217;ll have to gauge this one for yourself and use your best and most honest evaluations of your output, but there have been plenty of people — hundreds — who&#8217;ve been turned down dozens upon dozens of times before they ever scored a note to picture and even more than that who&#8217;ve been successful and then been told they were washed up, irrelevant, too old, too young, too inexperienced, too expensive, too high-profile, not high-profile enough&#8230; you name it. Point being: Rejection happens and you have to learn to accept it and deal with it appropriately.</p>
<p>There are many ways to face rejection, accept whatever truths come with it, and then discard the parts that don&#8217;t matter. One way is to be sure that you have the most healthy self-esteem you can have outside of your role as a creative person. I married a wonderful woman whom my every heartbeat pounds for. So, I don&#8217;t live every moment to be a composer or to even be a musician. It&#8217;s certainly a gigantic part of who I am at my core, but there are things and people in my life who are more important than any of this will ever be. I&#8217;m not alone in this feeling. Ask anyone who is creative and probably over the age of thirty. The secondary things in life, you realize over time, matter very little. Success takes on a whole new definition when love, children, family, and even the closest friends take root in your life as a middle-aged person. I spend a huge majority of my time trying to hip younger people who are ready to jump off the cliff of career suicide to this fact. When you get rejected, it&#8217;s not a rejection of <em>you as a person</em>, it&#8217;s simply that the timing of your artistic expression and that of the source material don&#8217;t align. That&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s the wrinkle of cosmic scheduling. You could bring the same set of demo cues to the next meeting and have the biggest film in history on your hands. Nobody knows. But whatever the case, rejection should only hit your art, not your heart. It&#8217;s just not worth it and it never ever lasts anyway, so why devote the emotional bandwidth?</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you don&#8217;t know how to read music.</strong></h3>
<p>Clearly, you will be at major and immediate disadvantage if you don&#8217;t read music and you are trying to break into the scene. Not only does this hamper your speed and agility as the point person for the music department on a production, but it will also hurt you as a potential candidate for an apprenticeship — the avenue by which a lot of film composers get their start. Like it or not, and argue all you want, but the film music business still thrives and depends on people who can read dots on a page. Period. Whether you are a musician at a session, an orchestrator sorting out lines for the composer, a copyist handling last-minute changes, or the composer yourself, you will need to read often. Written music comprehension is to a composer what the interpreting of blueprints is to an architect. Not knowing how to read the architectural drawings on the house you are building will be an unmitigated disaster. Imagine being a non-reading composer on the scoring stage and having to quickly change a lead-line for your director, transpose it in your head, and rattle it off to your 1st chair trumpet or clarinetist. Can you imagine? Well, please do&#8230; because that exact scenario is not a rare experience for the in-the-trenches film composer.</p>
<p>Does not reading make you a <em>bad</em> composer? Of course not. Even a few top-tier composers in the game started out just humming their melodies to an orchestrator. But before long, almost all of them learned to read and write at least functionally. Need to brush up? Take some private lessons; there are hundreds of teachers in LA, NYC, and London who will take you on as a private student and bring you up to functional and workable levels in no time. Don&#8217;t be embarrassed by your inability to read notes; not all composers who are working today are ace readers, either, and no matter how good you are, I promise you your musicians will always be ten times better anyway. But even still, having that very basic ability in your skill set will remove what is probably the biggest hurdle to self-confidence as a composer. It is your job as the captain of this ship to have a solid grasp of the fundamentals. This is as fundamental as it gets.</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; if you don&#8217;t live in a music mecca.</strong></h3>
<p>There you are&#8230; in Delaware. Don&#8217;t worry. Geographical misfortune does not a bad composer make. There&#8217;s been a lot of talk in the last decade about geography and how it correlates to the level of sophistication of a composer, implying that the farther away you are from a major music center the less &#8220;dedicated&#8221; you must be to your craft. Obviously that&#8217;s bullshit. It doesn&#8217;t matter where you live, your talents are your talents. Now, how accessible your talents are to those who need them&#8230; well, that&#8217;s another matter entirely.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re not a <em>bad</em> composer if you live in Cornwall. Still living with the folks in Texarkana? No problem. Never underestimate the powerful combo of a gigabit Internet connection and a fair amount of good old-fashioned hustle. You can accomplish a lot with an IMDbPro account, a well thought-out demo reel and a cell phone. But if you are determined to be in the thick of the film world, the brick and mortar studios are all still standing in Los Angeles. Film and TV seem to be the only industries who haven&#8217;t figured out that the world is flat like the video game industry has. They are making strides in that direction, but they aren&#8217;t there yet. Post-production on films and shows happens in LA.</p>
<h3><strong>&#8230; just because somebody says you are.</strong></h3>
<p>Human beings are strange creatures. We love to kick our wounded. I don&#8217;t know what it is, but people will love you when it&#8217;s easy to and hate you when it&#8217;s easier. There is nothing that will take the wind out of your sails more than negative feedback from colleagues. Complete strangers? Whatevs. But colleagues&#8230; That&#8217;s a tough knife in the gut. And there are those out there who are self-loathing enough to let you have it. Believe me. As I&#8217;ve just finished a very personal project, the barbs from the people I figured would lob them last have found their mark. And for a while, I internalized every one, taking it apart and searching for where I&#8217;d gone wrong. But then I realized that those people are not my audience. Do you make music for other musicians? I sure don&#8217;t. So what was I worried about?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: The people who love what you do love it because it does something for them. It fills something in them. It cures what&#8217;s ailing, if only for five minutes. That is your <em>audience</em>. <em>The</em> <em>fans</em>. Not the freaks&#8230; <em>the fans</em>. The freaks are just freaking. They need something to freak about so that they don&#8217;t have to keep staring at their own work. There will be people who &#8220;get&#8221; what you do and there will be people who just don&#8217;t and never will. Just accept that those people aren&#8217;t the people you are doing this for and they likely never will be. Don&#8217;t read your comment feed. Never punch down. Even the biggest stars in entertainment get railed by the folks who are sitting at home doing nothing. If you happen to convert a non-believer through consistent output that ultimately changes their mind, awesome&#8230; You&#8217;re lucky. That doesn&#8217;t happen often. Take great care of them and don&#8217;t abuse their commitment to your art by following up with a piece of crap. But if you never do, remember who you are playing to: <em>Your fans</em>. The dedicated few. Your niche. Your tribe. Your supporters. The people who will join your mailing list, share your content in their social circles, attend your panel discussions, and email occasionally to tell you they &#8220;enjoyed this last one&#8221;. That is the person you are working for. That is where your mental bandwidth deserves allocation. Not thinking about how to <em>get new fans</em>&#8230;. but thinking about how to care for the ones who are here already. That&#8217;s an endgame that matters.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Composer Brian Ralston puts a different spin on how you sell yourself as a composer in today's over-saturated market.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was talking with a friend, who, on behalf of his brother, was asking for advice on getting into the industry.  Specifically, his brother is the musician in the family while my friend is a more traditional businessman who sells product. My pal asked me, &#8220;How do you determine what to charge? I know that in my industry I have to do an analysis of what a product costs me to produce and how much profit margin I need to make to survive. If a music mix takes a certain number of hours and you can determine its cost to show the client, why can you not get people to pay for that?&#8221; This inevitably led to the train of thought that <em>you charge what you are worth </em>— a topic we have discussed here at SCOREcast many times in the past. But upon further discussion, I determined that in advising his brother on how to charge for his work, there was a fundamental problem in their approach. They were focused on selling the wrong product.</p>
<p>What Are You Selling?</p>
<p>Answer this question for yourself. As a composer, what product are you selling? Think about it. Answer honestly in your head before you read on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&#8230;(Queue Merv Griffin&#8217;s &#8220;Jeopardy&#8221; theme)&#8230;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you answer &#8220;music?&#8221; Did you answer &#8220;a film score?&#8221; Did you answer &#8220;fully produced tracks?&#8221; &#8220;Original compositions?&#8221; Well&#8230; you are wrong on all accounts. What is the product you are selling? The product you are selling is YOU!</p>
<p>It is a fundamental shift in how you look at your business. It&#8217;s why some composers can charge seven figures and perhaps you can not — those composers are worth more. But if you are frustrated because you feel the fully produced tracks on your demo are just as polished and unique as those composer&#8217;s then you are taking your eye off the ball. It is NOT about your music. It is about <em>YOU</em>. <em>You</em> are the product. ALL of <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>Of course you produce music, but that is only part of it. You also make the director feel like his or her movie was the best thing made this year. You also solve problems with a positive and professional approach that makes people want to be around you for months at a time on a project. You also communicate well and deliver on time and on budget. There is so much more to it.</p>
<p>The challenge in setting a price for your music is really just determining what <em>YOU</em> are worth to the client, rather than what your <em>music</em> is worth. A Blu-Ray can be purchased at the nearest store for about $15-$20 USD. There is a value assessment to that product that the market has determined and can sustain. But with us, our value changes — sometimes overnight. If your movie hits #1 in the country, all of a sudden you&#8217;ll be worth more. It is not like your music is any different today than it was yesterday before your film hit number one at the box office, but the value of having you on a future project is now much more valuable to a producer or director. It has nothing to do with your music.</p>
<p>The honest truth: If you are having a hard time getting your fee up it is because the industry does not feel <em>YOU</em> are worth that. If they felt you were worth the money, they would find the money to cover your fee. It also plays into <a title="Deane Ogden: Founder of SCOREcast" href="http://www.deaneogden.com/" target="_blank">Deane Ogden</a>&#8216;s frequent posts about the <em><a title="DeaneOgden.com | The Culture of Free" href="http://www.deaneogden.com/2012/02/23/the-culture-of-free/" target="_blank">culture of free</a></em>. If we agree to free gigs, we are simply affirming to the industry that we are worth&#8230; nothing.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the next time you re-evaluate your business plan and try to determine what your fee is, remember what it is that you are actually trying to sell. Also remember that you are not a <em>composer looking for a job</em>, you are a <em>business looking for clients</em>. It is a subtle distinction but an important one. It shifts the dynamic of where you sit on the ladder with your clients.</p>
<p>The product is not your music — the product is <em>YOU!</em></p>
<p>[sncallout type=&#8221;announcement&#8221;]<em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Leave your thoughts on this below. I would love to hear your take on what makes YOU a valuable product to your clients.</span> — Brian</strong></em>[/sncallout]</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Aurora tragedy has sent shockwaves through the filmgoing community, and has almost silenced the filmmaking one. The <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/aurora-colo-batman-shooter-james-holmes-phd-student/story?id=16817842" target="_blank" class="">senseless act that ended the lives of twelve innocent moviegoers</a> and violently and unnecessarily interrupted the lives of dozens more is a staggering and sobering realization that, when you really get honest about it,&nbsp;nowhere in the world is a safe place anymore. Bad things, horrible things, will happen in public places, and will not necessarily be done in the dark alleys and forgotten corners of your city in quite the way they perhaps unfold onscreen in movies like <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>.</p>
<p>The hours following the tragedy simply had me at a loss for words. There was nothing to say. There was no hopeful thing to utter, no inspirational quip that would take any of the sting away. The atmosphere, both in reality and online, was just too damned dark and deflated to do anything but sit in the undeniable shock and awe of the situation. As a human being, there was nothing to be done but offer condolences to the families who were directly touched by the events.</p>
<p>But, as a movie maker, as an artist, I absolutely do have things to say about these events. I think we probably all do. In no way do I say this to downplay the events or take away from the extreme horror and selfishness that occurred at the hands of the sicko responsible, but the attack was not just a random attack on humanity — <em>It was also an assault against art</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that the man behind the masacre never fathomed this far ahead in his&nbsp;convoluted&nbsp;state, but he essentially caused a ripple effect for a lot of people that stikes at the core of the human creative experience. The people who were waiting to see that film weren&#8217;t your average moviegoers. They were diehards; in-costume advanced-ticket purchasers who were making a special effort to wait in line for something they&#8217;d been anticipating since 2005. The fact that they had made such huge efforts to be there in the middle of the night proves that cinema is still alive and well in this country and that the naysayers have it all wrong. So long as we create something compelling, interesting, and in their minds worthy of being viewed in the sanctity of a movie theater, we are doing our jobs.</p>
<h2>An&nbsp;Assault&nbsp;On Art</h2>
<p>And that is what I&#8217;ve been pondering for the last 32 hours. <em>The peace of the moviegoing experience.</em></p>
<p><em></em>A movie theater has always been a place of escapism. The place where people go to forget about the plausibility of someone quietly&nbsp;entering&nbsp;a room wearing a gas mask and opening fire. The movie theater is an incubator where children hatch dreams (and even a few old people, too). A place where people are free to reflect on the things that broad daylight won&#8217;t allow them to. A place where folks can get real and honest with the things they are wrestling with in their hearts and minds and lose themselves in imagination— a 90 minute dream sleep, if you will; a coming-to-grips with certain things that perhaps a film will challenge them on that no other entity in their lives will have the balls to. <em>That</em> is the beauty of the movie theater. It is a place of wonder, challenge, and fearless anonymity.</p>
<p>But what is it now? Is all of that now ruined because some mental case walked into a midnight screening and forced his alternate universe down the throats of 100 innocent bystanders? For some, yes. Definitely. For some, this event has stolen the freedom a movie theater provides them to completely go on autopilot for two hours and simply &#8220;enjoy the ride&#8221;. That&#8217;s not an insignificant concern and we cannot blame those who now feel unsafe and exposed in a plush red seat.</p>
<p>For me, and I hope for every artist and moviemaker out there… I say &#8220;Fuck that.&#8221; Strong words, I know, and I do not mean any irreverence toward anyone or anything other than Mr. James Holmes and any other savages who would dare take up his cross. To them I say&#8230; If you think you&#8217;ve downed humanity, you are obviously delusional. We get kicked in the teeth from time to time, but we never lay down for more. If you think you&#8217;ve leveled off the moviegoing experience, wrong again. Maybe for a second, but it will bounce back. It always does.</p>
<p>As for <em>art</em> and <em>creation</em> as holistic concepts? If you think you&#8217;ve stopped the proliferation of artistic expression — or even put a dent in it or slowed it down in any way — you are crazier than they are giving you credit for in the press.&nbsp;Art is bigger than you, Mr. Holmes. It is stronger, meaner, nicer, better, worse, funnier, sadder, saner and more delusional than you could ever hope to be or imagine being. Art has built empires and taken down dynasties. It was here long before you were even a twinkle in your mother&#8217;s eye — long before the world even thought about giving way to you or the bloodline that produced you. Art has been around for millions of years; since the inception of thought, really. It will be around for millions more. In fact, dare I say that as clever as you might think you are, you haven&#8217;t arrived at any original thought here that art hasn&#8217;t already beat you to in the pantheon of storytelling.</p>
<h2>Good vs. Evil</h2>
<p>It is interesting to note that the very nature of the Batman character is the antithesis of James Holmes&#8217;. Batman never kills anyone. He doesn&#8217;t use weapons to hurt or maim, steal or destroy. Instead, he chooses to fight evil with good and to stand for something most of us are realizing we have less and less ability to stand for on our own: <em>Justice</em>. For us to turn our focus from being a people who love and partake in entertainment to a people who love entertainment but are now unwilling to be entertained would be a travesty, I believe. Instead, it is time to turn our eyes toward the goodness in people, to recognize now more than ever that the prevailing triumphs of art and creativity are what feed a lot of that good to begin with, and to continue on making the most amazing things we&#8217;ve ever made. To think less, dream more, and work together to achieve masterpieces. Those kinds of works cannot be toppled. They can never be taken, destroyed, or ultimately even marginalized by anyone or anything.</p>
<p>To say that this event is horrific is to drastically understate the situation. It will never be forgotten and it will never fade from view. For those directly touched by it, it will serve as a terrible reminder of what happens when evil gets through the door unchecked and interferes with those we treasure most. But my hope is that as art has been a healing balm for many of society&#8217;s past wounds, the <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> will and can help us heal from this too. After all, underneath the great costumes, the cool gadgets, the Batmobile and the action set-pieces, what people are really coming to see is the good guy prevail against the bad guy. That doesn&#8217;t always happen the Hollywood way — sometimes the bad guy gets his licks in first. But in the grand scheme of the story, we good guys always just keep surging forth, evolving, and staying fierce. As for movies… well&#8230; in this ever-changing business, who the hell knows. But somehow we will continue to entertain people, whatever the format looks like in years to come.</p>
<p>For art as an ideal? Not to worry&#8230; <em>Art wins</em>. It always wins. It&#8217;s too big, too important. It&#8217;s&nbsp;the cornerstone of the ecosystem that supports our very existence as human beings. We need it too much to let it die at the hands of even a few, let alone one singular entity. Was the temple defiled? Absolutely. Perhaps in a way that it never has been. But, the temple still stands. It&#8217;s a little bruised, a little battered… but it refuses to be moved.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1354" title="SoundCloud_logo-800x500_orange" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/01/800x500_orange-640x400.png" alt="" width="640" height="400" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/01/800x500_orange-640x400.png 640w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/01/800x500_orange-389x243.png 389w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/01/800x500_orange.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><a href="http://soundcloud.com/" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a> is a versatile and effective platform for composers and sound content creators of all kinds, and is arguably the next big thing in online audio. Over the last year and a half I have invested hundreds of hours on SoundCloud and would like to spend a few minutes with you to share a few nuggets I&#8217;ve picked up along the way, that may help you as a composer, and that may shed some light on the community aspects of the service, as well.</p>
<h3>Ten Point Briefing</h3>
<ol>
<li>SoundCloud is an audio platform for sharing, promotion and collaboration, with its own social networking framework.</li>
<li>SoundCloud is accessed via desktop web browsers, embedded webpage widgets and smartphone apps.</li>
<li>SoundCloud began as a music file sharing service in Berlin in 2007, by Alexander Ljung and Eric Wahlforss, growing from 1 million members in May 2010 to 9 million members in December 2011.</li>
<li>Members can upload sound files in all common formats, with public or limited visibility, downloadability and all common licensing options, Buy links and a vanity URL, for example soundcloud.com/the-chemical-brothers.</li>
<li>Tracks can have players embedded on external websites with flexible appearance and browser compatibility options.</li>
<li>Members can follow other members, provide feedback via timed comments, mark tracks as favourites, keep abreast of other member activity on a dashboard, and create and join groups.</li>
<li>Detailed stats are available, showing who played your track, where, when, how often, and who downloaded or saved your track to their favourites list.</li>
<li>SoundCloud is well integrated with Twitter, Facebook and other online social networks. At the Facebook f8 conference in September 2011, Facebook announced a strategic technology partnership with SoundCloud, effectively providing SoundCloud embedded exposure to over 800 million Facebook users.</li>
<li>Membership is free but there are premium accounts ranging from €29 to €500 offering various levels of storage, stats, widgets, support and other options.</li>
<li>Finally, and crucially, SoundCloud is a community.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Who Uses SoundCloud?</h3>
<p>Essentially, sound content creators of all types, and listeners of all tastes. From dance music producers like Deadmau5, Skrillex and Swedish House Mafia to A-list pop stars like Lady Gaga, Radiohead and Bjork, from indie singer/songwriters to podcasters, comedians and even newspapers like The Economist, and of course composers.</p>
<p>I asked a handful of film and television composers to share their experiences of SoundCloud, starting with LA-based Kerry Muzzey, who enjoys the community-oriented learning and social aspects of SoundCloud:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I have fallen in love with SoundCloud. I&#8217;ve enjoyed it not only for the many musical discoveries I&#8217;ve made but also for the ability to interact with other composers. I love that so many have been willing to share their tech tips and secret recipes. Sure, it&#8217;s a really simple and slick demo-hosting site: but take some time to go a little deeper and you&#8217;ll be surprised at the community you&#8217;ll discover: these are people who are passionate about music and about the beauty of sound.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Sean Beeson from Ohio has over 400,000 track plays on SoundCloud and gains from the marketing aspects it offers:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I use SoundCloud to gauge the success of my online marketing campaigns. I can see what sites people are accessing my music from, where in the world they are listening from, and what music the are listening to. It helps me to cater my sets to what music is most listened to in the hopes that I can gain greater exposure for my work.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Geographically, members are spread across the world in roughly the following order: US, UK, Germany, rest of Europe, Canada, Russia, Australia, Japan, rest of world.</p>
<p>UK-based Marie-Anne Fischer, film and television composer and chapter director of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/composium/" target="_blank">SCOREcast: London</a>, has experience with a number of online music platforms including ReverbNation. Marie-Anne shared a little about using SoundCloud for professional showreel and private sharing purposes:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I discovered SoundCloud <em>about 10 months ago </em>when I started writing demos for Sonokinetic because they use SoundCloud to post their demos. I like the direct connection and simplicity. SoundCloud is becoming more interesting to me as I have found more film and media composers on SoundCloud than I had on ReverbNation. I like the group features on SoundCloud where there is no clutter. I tend to be using SoundCloud more recently to link prospective clients to my showreel and being able to share private tracks is a great feature.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Given the fact that there are over 9 million members, of course not all members are professionals in the line of work they present on SoundCloud and membership is arguably weighted towards amateur enthusiasts, but that does not detract from its usefulness in professional spheres.</p>
<h3>Can SoundCloud Help Your Career?</h3>
<p>SCOREcast: London&#8217;s own Dominik Johnson, world music production specialist:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>SoundCloud, for me, is one of the best community music tools online at the moment for the pro musician / composer / producer. I know the audio quality on my music (typically 48kHz/24bit) can be lost with some of the upload compression, but to me, that’s a price worth paying. A few months ago an independent film director from Berlin got in touch after hearing a few of my works on there, we got chatting on there, then we starting having Skype calls – and BOOM! I’ve been commissioned to write some tracks for his upcoming feature documentary – and yes, his production team does have a budget for the music.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Dominik touched on a point above with regards to upload/playback quality, which I&#8217;ll explore in the Technical section further below.</p>
<p>I know of one case where the SoundCloud user was not necessarily the <em>beneficiary</em> of a career opportunity. LA-based film composer, orchestrator and conductor Deon Vozov has this story:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>For me as a composer, no, there&#8217;s nothing that&#8217;s happened on SoundCloud without my initiation that&#8217;s led to a contract. However, because I also do some small music supervision work, I have FOUND tracks on SoundCloud and gotten them placed in projects. The first few were free, but there are starting to be licensing gigs that pay a little something, help build reels, and feel more dignified. And believe me, it is much more fun to approach people with money than with &#8220;it&#8217;ll be good for your reel&#8221; statements of questionable accuracy.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Deon continues with an interesting point about the depth of SoundCloud&#8217;s penetration into the upper echelons of film-making:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>My clients seem to fall into two categories: producers and directors who are very, or at least comfortably, familiar with SoundCloud but not very well-funded yet, and producers and directors who’ve never heard of SoundCloud but can cut those juicy checks we all love to then spend getting the job done.</em></p>
<p><em> In other words, my experience has been that it&#8217;s still not an industry standard in audio post production. By gently guiding clients towards it, however, I think it will become more so.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Offering more insights than I could ever have hoped for, Deon goes on to make a point about visual versus audio impact of a demo reel:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>That said, it&#8217;s not selfless support of SoundCloud that has led me to steer clients to the site. Rather, I like to link even initially skittish clients, and potential clients, to private sets here because <strong>it gets them focused on listening with their ears rather than their eyes </strong>[emphasis mine]. </em></p>
<p><em>Everyone wants video links, and they will tell you with a straight face that they&#8217;re really listening to the music, and they really do believe that they&#8217;re telling the truth when they say that. But the reality is that these are highly visual, highly visually sensitive, and highly visually creative people experiencing audio tracks by way of how they feel about picture. </em></p>
<p><em>It is possible to separate picture from music, of course, but difficult, and it will always imprint indelibly upon the track. That can work in one&#8217;s favor (an expensive car spot, for example) or against it (a feature that suffers a malaise of some kind or other). By sending clients to a simple, easy-to-navigate, custom-built set, they have an interactive experience and can jump around in the set to find what they want to discuss and, if they&#8217;re bold enough to create an account, they can even leave timed comments for us to discuss in relation to their project.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Many of the responses in this section came to me as a result of engaging with the community on SoundCloud directly by publishing a track inviting my followers to share their stories as timed comments. Here&#8217;s a handful of other stories, in brief:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Uploaded 1st track, surprised by response. Uploaded more. Got made Soundclouder of the Day and then featured on SoundCloud <a title="SoundCloud Tour Page" href="http://soundcloud.com/tour" target="_blank">tour page</a>. Label emailed me and now I have two releases out.<br />
— Russell Knight, London</em></p>
<p><em>A few months ago Norwegian Landscape photographer Ole Salomonsen approached me via SoundCloud, asking if he could use my track &#8216;Counting Stars&#8217; on his latest vid of the Northern Lights. My first piece of paid work.<br />
</em><em>— Mei-Ling Grey, London</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Amidst the success stories, two cautionary tales emerged:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I believe I did *not* get a gig because of the music in my SoundCloud profile. I was considered during the final round of applicants, and <em>when asked for a portfolio I </em>directed them to my SoundCloud profile. Something like two days later I found out they gave the job to someone else. </em><em>This has led me to reassess the quality of the work I upload to SoundCloud, even though it could be that the work I have on my SoundCloud is quite different from the piece I made for that job.<br />
</em><em>— Rodrigo Hernández, Mexico City</em></p>
<p><em>I signed a contract with a company called [redacted] who have a group here on SoundCloud about three months ago. I had to go to a notary and everything, alas I have not heard from them since and they don&#8217;t reply to my emails.</em><br />
<em>— Andy Carter, Cornwall, UK</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The insights I&#8217;ve gained from these last two are to keep one&#8217;s SoundCloud profile tidy and focused on the target market, and to know who you&#8217;re dealing with.</p>
<p>One reason I&#8217;m able to share this article with you today is that my own case is potentially one more success story to emerge from SoundCloud, but this is not about me so I&#8217;ll save that for the end.</p>
<h3>How SoundCloud Compares to Other Audio Platforms</h3>
<p>In the user content audio hosting space, SoundCloud competes with, among others, BandCamp, ReverbNation and Myspace.</p>
<p><strong>BandCamp</strong> is mainly focused on allowing independent artists to sell their work, and are funded in part on a commission basis. Users can customise the look and feel of their music pages and have their tracks downloadable in many formats. BandCamp has attracted some commercially established artists including Amanda Palmer to abandon their labels and self-promote (interestingly, Amanda Palmer also has a <a title="SoundCloud: Amanda Palmer" href="http://soundcloud.com/amandapalmer">SoundCloud account</a>).</p>
<p>Jeremiah Pena, SCOREcaster, says:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I like Bandcamp. I don&#8217;t get as many track plays as Soundcloud, but it&#8217;s my main method of selling music to the general public, which SoundCloud doesn&#8217;t seem to do very well. It&#8217;s also very useful for building email lists, since you can have people supply an email address for free downloads. And it&#8217;s free, with no major limits like the free version of SoundCloud. I&#8217;m able to put a lot more music than I could there.</em></p>
<p><em>I do find SoundCloud much better for getting feedback and it has very good community features (commenting, groups, etc.) that Bandcamp doesn&#8217;t have.</em></p>
<p><em>— Jeremiah Pena, Film Composer, Utah</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In terms of usefulness to composers, BandCamp may serve a function to sell original soundtracks if the production licensing terms permit, but since BandCamp does not offer embedded players, the composer would have to set up a specific BandCamp page outside their main website, which may not be a desirable solution for those who like a one-stop-shop approach to their web presence.</p>
<p><strong>ReverbNation </strong>aims to provide a collaboration and communication platform as well as music hosting for independent artists, and have an embeddable player.</p>
<p>SCOREcast&#8217;s Marie-Anne Fischer knows ReverbNation well, having ruled the London and UK Classical charts with a regular #1 spot. In her words:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I started using ReverbNation in 2009 because I was able to link my playlist to my Facebook profile as an app. I wasn&#8217;t particularly interested at the time in having a Facebook fan page, so this was a great alternative. Unfortunately Facebook subsequently took away the ReverbNation band playlist feature from personal Facebook pages. &#8216;My Band&#8217; feature could only feature in a fan or group page but I was still able to use the widgets and apps for posting new tracks.</em></p>
<p><em>ReverbNation has been great for meeting musicians and I have already collaborated with a couple of them. During 2009 and 2010 I made great use of my ReverbNation site, my website is linked to my profile which I pay for annually.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Marie-Anne also offers us a comparison with her SoundCloud experience:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You can personalise ReverbNation&#8217;s profile which you can&#8217;t on SoundCloud but that hasn&#8217;t stopped me from using SoundCloud.</em></p>
<p><em>I like the statistics SoundCloud collects and provides me and also their feature where people can favour a track and leave a comment.</em></p>
<p><em>The great big difference between SoundCloud and ReverbNation is that SoundCloud is purely functional and works well where as on ReverbNation you can add your personal touch to your profile, link music to multiple stores, integrate with other websites, create newsletters, blogs and apps are only but a few of their features.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Marie-Anne is right about SoundCloud being less customisable than ReverbNation, which takes a modular approach to the profile page with a lot of control over content and branding. On SoundCloud, personalisation can be applied to player widgets for website-matching style and colour scheme, for user dropbox page branding, for linking other profiles like Twitter, Facebook etc. and for essential items like profile image and an HTML-enabled description area.</p>
<p>In terms of how that translates into commercial opportunities, I would argue that for a composer it is the presentation of your professional website that is more important than the presentation of your profile on the audio hosting website, but that can be debated in the comments below.</p>
<p>One other factor to consider is the service value available to non-paying customers. Although ReverbNation&#8217;s free account allows more tracks to be hosted than SoundCloud&#8217;s free account, the size of each track is limited to 8MB which forces lossy upload format; the longer the track the lossier it has to be to fit into 8MB.</p>
<p><strong>Myspace</strong> does not make for great headlines these days, having been sold to News Corporation for $580 million in 2005 and then bought by Specific Media and Justin Timberlake in 2011 for $35 million. But as a music hosting social networking site with 33 million unique US visitors in August 2011, it cannot be ignored in this comparison.</p>
<p>Oxford-based soundtrack composer, electronica producer and SCOREcast reader &#8220;The Unfinished&#8221; (Matt Bowdler) shared his experience with me:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Myspace, I haven&#8217;t used for a long time. It may have improved, but I think it has been superceded by SoundCloud from a music hosting perspective and Facebook from a community perspective. The options were limited (I think ten tracks was the maximum) and it just got incredibly spammy. Endless messages from people who were plugging their latest track or gig that was almost always a genre that bore no relevenace to what you were doing. Quite a bit of spam from Myspace themselves as well. Put quite simply, there isn&#8217;t anything that Myspace does that isn&#8217;t done better elsewhere.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I think Matt&#8217;s view is shared by many in the music community including myself: That Myspace is not necessarily the most strategic technology partner for a professional composer. If you disagree, please share your experience in the comments below.</p>
<h3>Technical Considerations</h3>
<p>How do you get your SoundCloud tracks on your web page? SoundCloud makes it simple.</p>
<p>You can embed SoundCloud widgets in several sizes and styles, with both Flash and HTML5 options. HTML5 is more mobile browser-friendly, especially on iPhones and iPads which can&#8217;t play Flash, but some older browsers (e.g. IE6) can&#8217;t view HTML5.</p>
<p>To embed a track or set, use the Share menu item at top left of the track or set to access the widget options, customise to taste.</p>
<p>Here are some Flash and HTML5 examples of embedded track players.</p>

<h4>The main technical issues reported by professional SoundCloud users are well-known and steps have been taken to address them.</h4>
<p><em>1. SoundCloud playback is compressed at 128kbps, which many audiophiles can discern distinctly from studio-quality uncompressed recording.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In previous email exchanges, SoundCloud staff let me know that they&#8217;re always thinking of and considering ways to make the experience better for both creators and listeners. One way for creators to offer higher quality is to enable downloads for their sounds so listeners can access the file in its original quality. They&#8217;re regularly discussing this topic internally and are considering changes in the future.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In the meantime, SoundCloud seems to remain the platform of choice for many sound libraries&#8217; demo tracks, including Sonokinetic, 8dio and others, which is a good indicator that the quality, although not perfect, is widely acceptable for professional demo purposes.</p>
<p><em>2. Flash-based SoundCloud players are subject to the inherent stability and compatibility issues of Flash, particularly where smartphones often have trouble showing Flash controls.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">SoundCloud recently released HTML5 versions of their embeddable widgets, addressing both the stability problem and making it compatible with most smartphones and mobile devices including iPhones and iPads. The new HTML5 widgets have been well-received and many say better looking than their Flash predecessors.</p>
<p><em>3. Some users reported that the encoding produced glitchy playback, particularly in high frequency ranges and at high volume levels.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Up until recently, SoundCloud advised: &#8220;This rarely happens but if it does, we suggest uploading in 320kbps 44.1kHz with at least -3dB of headroom&#8221; but a recent discovery has revealed that this is no longer required.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FLAC is the recommended upload format for optimal playback quality, but this may not be ideal for download purposes and is probably best-suited for playback-only tracks (non-downloadable). For people who would prefer to have their files available for download, the higher the quality of the lossy file they upload, the higher quality the encoding will be.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The <a title="SoundCloud: Help" href="http://help.soundcloud.com/customer/portal/articles/94796" target="_blank">Help Page</a> on this topic offers this advice:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Sometimes our transcoding system can create audio artifacts, as we transcode all tracks to 128 kbps mp3 for streaming playback. Uploading a lossless or high-quality lossy file will usually reduce these to a minimum, but unfortunately there&#8217;s not much we can do for the handful of individual tracks that are still affected.</em></p>
<p><em>If you choose to make your track downloadable though, the version users can download will be an exact copy of the version you uploaded, without any transcoding.</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is an important point with regards to using SoundCloud for track sharing between yourself and the film production co, or for demo or collaborative purposes: <strong>The track you download is the exact track that was uploaded, regardless of the playback encoding</strong>. So you can happily share your 192kHz 32-bit float wav file if that tickles your fancy, in full trust that that is how it will be received. You can also do so in complete privacy without violating your NDA.</p>
<p><em>4. SoundCloud has experienced unscheduled downtime in the past.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For 24 hours in October 2011, SoundCloud fell victim to an aggressive DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack leading to slow response times and occasional periods of downtime.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">No data was lost in the attack and no user profile security was compromised, but better measures have since been put in place to defend against future attacks of that nature. Unfortunately, no website is untouchable from such an attack attempt.</p>
<h3>My SoundCloud Story</h3>
<p>I joined SoundCloud in August 2010 and from the start had a revelatory and inspirational experience, so much so that by New Year&#8217;s Day 2011 I resolved to turn my life-long passion and hobby into a career. This I knew would be a long path but one that would hopefully be rewarding at every step of the way, and as 2011 passed by, I reflected on those intentions in confidence that things were finally moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>My first steps on SoundCloud were like most others—a one-way path of uploading music and hoping it would be heard and liked by someone, somewhere, just as most creative artists hope for their own art to be observed and appreciated. It only really happened for me when I realised that it was more than a music hosting site but a community as well.</p>
<p>And so I started engaging in-depth with other people&#8217;s music—going through their entire track lists to understand their own creative processes and leaving comments and, drawing on my own experience, leaving constructive feedback along the way. This revealed the reciprocal nature of SoundCloud interaction when all of a sudden my own tracks started drawing a lot of attention.</p>
<h4>Community</h4>
<p>The third stage of my SoundCloud involvement began in June when I decided to try tapping into the collective creativity of the SoundCloud community.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first crowd-sourcing project was extremely simple: &#8220;I invite you to suggest a name for this track&#8221;. SoundCloud staff noticed this, thought it was a cool idea, and tweeted it to their then 80,000 followers. My track got absolutely bombed by name suggestions and the winning title and subtitle were really well-suited to the track (<a href="http://soundcloud.com/oliversadie/namethis">White Light Rendezvous: For Those Who Follow</a>). With around 200 followers at the time, I then gained another 200 or so on the back of that mini-project.</li>
<li>The second project was a little more ambitious. I played a 9 minute piano improvisation and called it &#8220;I invite you to suggest an orchestral composition with timed comments on this track.&#8221; This got a lot of attention too with comments like &#8220;a harp arpeggio phrase for next 8 bars&#8221; and after about 100 comments I spent a month composing those elements over the original piano improv. I called the resulting track <a href="http://soundcloud.com/oliversadie/scs">&#8220;SoundCloud Sinfonietta: You Composed This&#8221;</a> which quickly racked up over 5,000 plays and was a finalist in the <a href="http://www.g-technology.eu/competition/">G-Technology Europe Driven Creativity Awards</a>.</li>
<li>The third project is still on-going and is called <a href="http://soundcloud.com/oliversadie/your-tune">&#8220;Your Tune&#8221;</a> where I invited followers to share a 20-second solo melody and composed a full-length orchestral or band instrumental track using the submitted melody.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Career Break</h4>
<p>As well as the community projects I run on SoundCloud, I also produce a lot of original work and get involved in many collaborations. Through a friend on SoundCloud, one of my original tracks <a href="http://soundcloud.com/oliversadie/ochre-threads-piano">&#8220;Ochre Threads&#8221;</a> was heard by an independent filmmaker in LA, also on SoundCloud, who is working on his 3rd feature-length film and wanted to use the track for a particular scene.</p>
<p>The same filmmaker then spotted a track I released in December 2011—<a href="http://soundcloud.com/oliversadie/of-valour">&#8220;Of Valour&#8221;</a>—and on the strength of that alone gave me the opportunity to score the entire feature-length film, due for release in Summer 2012.</p>
<p>This is potentially the career break I&#8217;ve dreamed of for many years and could be my ticket to full-time paid filmscoring work in the future.</p>
<h3>SoundCloud Communities</h3>
<p>Apart from members who used underhanded spam-like tactics to drive playcount and visibility, the most active and successful accounts are those of people who take the time to listen and provide feedback to other SoundClouders. The communities thrive in the timed comments, the track favouritings, the collaborations and in groups, especially those which have forum-like chat areas. There are also regular live meetups across the world, like <a href="http://blog.soundcloud.com/2011/10/13/soundcloud-global-meetup-day-review/">this one</a> in October 2011, which Yoko Ono got involved in too.</p>
<p>Naturally I prefer an organically grown community to one built on spam and follow-backs, and contributed <a href="http://soundcloud.com/101/community-building">&#8220;How to Grow Your SoundCloud Community&#8221;</a> to SoundCloud HQ, which they keep on the front page of the user guide here: <a href="http://soundcloud.com/101">soundcloud.com/101</a></p>
<p>The SoundCloud community is well supported by dedicated community teams with staff in Berlin, London and San Francisco, headed by <a title="Europa Award Winners 2011" href="http://theeuropas.com/2011/11/peer-index-wins-the-grand-prix-as-the-europas-awards-drifts-eastwards/" target="_blank">Europa Award-Winner</a> <strong><a title="David Noël" href="http://david-noel.com/" target="_blank">David Noël</a></strong>. The team actively promotes community projects via their <a title="SoundCloud Blog" href="http://blog.soundcloud.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>, <a title="Facebook: SoundCloud" href="http://www.facebook.com/soundcloud" target="_blank">Facebook</a> page (500,000+ followers) and <a title="Twitter: SoundCloud" href="http://twitter.com/SoundCloud">Twitter</a> account (150,000+ followers), for example a global project collecting translations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in as many languages as possible.</p>
<p>One very charming aspect of the <strong><a title="SoundCloud: Community Team" href="http://soundcloud.com/community-team" target="_blank">SoundCloud Community Team</a></strong> is their daily SoundClouder Of The Day nomination, where a member is singled out for their community activity or other unique attribute that deserves recognition. SCOTD alumni are then often contacted for input on community questions and feedback, and are given a little boost in follower-ship by means of a shoutout on their social networks.</p>
<p>&#8220;This Week in SoundCloud&#8221; is another community project highlighting interesting discoveries across the &#8216;Cloud, in podcast format on a weekly basis (incidentally, the jingle for this podcast was written by me and 2 other SoundClouders).</p>
<p>There is a lot to the SoundCloud platform, it is not just an audio widget on your demo page. I&#8217;ll end where I began: SoundCloud is a versatile and effective platform for composers and sound content creators of all kinds. It is arguably the next big thing in online audio, and maybe most important&#8230; it <em>is</em> a community.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Attention spans are short and very demanding. If you want to make your art into a business, you have to brand yourself and then market your art. No getting away from it.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For some reason, we creative types seem to take an instant dislike to the notion of Branding and Marketing.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t be quantified or packaged. We&#8217;re artists, darling. Our art speaks for itself. All true&#8230; but all the art out there is vying equally for all of your potential clients&#8217; attentions. And those attention spans are short and very demanding. If you want to make your art into a business, i.e. make money at it, you&#8217;ve no choice &#8211; you have to brand yourself and then market your art. No getting away from it.</p>
<p>And as film composers and sound designers, we&#8217;re usually selling art that&#8217;s <em>yet to be created</em>. So what might be a more effective overall marketing strategy is to think of how we can sell ourselves, our persona, our fun-to-work-with-ness, our attitudes to career and life, how you and I collaborating together will without a doubt create something more awesome than we could possibly have done separately.</p>
<p>So marketing is very important to the film music composer or sound designer. But it need not be boring, time-consuming or expensive. Marketing for us film sound creators can be quick, easy, painless, fun, interesting, and very cheap if you take a little time to think creatively about it. Even if you&#8217;re totally anti-marketing/branding/selling your soul, you&#8217;re probably doing some of it already without even realising it (I&#8217;ve talked about some of this in <em><a href="../../../2010/06/heather-fenoughty-personality-branding.html"><strong>Personality Branding</strong></a></em>).</p>
<p><strong>And</strong>&#8230; if it sells more of your work or your services, what you complainin&#8217; about? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Here are all of the ways I can think of (so far) that a film music composer may market themselves. I&#8217;ve separated them out into whether I&#8217;ve used them or not, and how useful they&#8217;ve been up &#8217;til now. Hopefully you can pick out a few to start forming an easy strategy for marketing your wares and yourself.</p>
<p>This turned into rather a long list so stick with it&#8230;</p>
<h1>Marketing Stuff that really works &#8211; directly led to sales:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Online portfolio website with music and contact details</li>
<li>DVD Showreel ready to go upon request</li>
<li>Tailored CD submissions</li>
<li>Music licensing on other site which led to commissions</li>
<li>Content marketing (fancy name for blog attached to website): writing blog posts about opinions and thoughts about my experiences. This is all about building a connection with audience, fleshing out a more thorough picture of yourself, what you&#8217;re like as a person to work with rather than just a faceless, personality-less, unknown quantity.</li>
<li>Networking in person and seeing it as an opportunity to make connections for people with other people.</li>
<li>Having an elevator pitch ready to go&#8230; then getting out of the way, asking questions, listening, really engaging in creating the potential for a new business relationship.</li>
<li>Twitter for both forging new relationships and developing ones already made through other methods.</li>
<li>Maintaining and keeping tabs on pre-made business relationships on Facebook.</li>
<li>Word of Mouth recommendations from people you&#8217;ve worked with before. Isn&#8217;t as tricky as you might first think &#8211; be easy to work with, go above and beyond, add value, and make the client feel special (&#8216;cos they are &#8211; they&#8217;re working with you aren&#8217;t they?).</li>
<li>Working in associated roles &#8211; this is really a form of networking. The word-of-mouth that you can gain about you being a really cool person and being great to work with works wonders when you hear about new projects coming up and you offer music composition/sound design!</li>
<li>Collaborating with other artists in relevant areas for free or as equally paid co-creators in order to raise both of our profiles.</li>
<li>Doing really awesome work with awesome people on awesome shows with high profile venues/channels with massive audiences is worth its weight in gold (though this probably counts a word of mouth too).</li>
<li>Giving away free CDs of pre-composed music to trusted filmmakers to license whenever they might like to in the future. Sometimes they&#8217;ll come back to you for a bespoke version or even a new commission.</li>
<li>Participating on relevant trade forums.</li>
<li>Sending showreel CDs out to local and national production companies. I actually did this without checking whether they wanted to hear it first, tut tut. Even though it worked for me, right at the start of my career when I was a little fraidy-cat when it came to cold calling, it was such a small response &#8211; 3 replies from 100+ CDs sent out &#8211; that really, I spent an awful lot of money that could have been saved just by making a few phone calls. Though you never know&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<h1>Marketing stuff that probably worked indirectly, though I don&#8217;t know for sure, or methods I&#8217;ve implemented so recently that&#8217;s it&#8217;s hard to say what effect it&#8217;s yet to have:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Website SEO (search engine optimisation)</li>
<li>Building a website with a CMS or &#8216;Content Management System&#8217; (e.g. wordpress, joomla) that&#8217;s very easily update-able with news, presents a more unified site where the blog isn&#8217;t just an add on, and where you don&#8217;t need to go into the code to make site-wide changes.</li>
<li>Asking for testimonials for your website &#8211; also reminds the client how great it was working with you. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>Following up with email note after networking meetings (&#8216;great to meet you&#8217; type stuff).</li>
<li>Business cards handed out at networking events and included in showreel mailouts.</li>
<li>Trade press and general newspaper interviews.</li>
<li>Relevant website interviews.</li>
<li>Writing articles for relevant websites (such as this one).</li>
<li>Email signature including links to my latest work on- or off-line.</li>
<li>Twitter-driven traffic to my website &#8211; these visitors tend to stay around on the website a little longer than the average.</li>
<li>Scheduling tweets for Twitter to maintain a more consistent, steady online presence and reach more followers in all the different timezones.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong><br />
</strong>Marketing stuff I&#8217;ve tried that hasn&#8217;t worked for me so far (but might for you&#8230; but it&#8217;s dubious, and if you don&#8217;t have time or money or energy, then maybe don&#8217;t bother):</h1>
<ul>
<li>Private online music store selling mp3s and music licenses for media attached to my website.</li>
<li>A website built on flash &#8211; very little search engine traffic at all as most of it can&#8217;t be indexed.</li>
<li>&#8220;Faking it &#8217;til you make it&#8221;/exaggerating your achievements/pretending to be something you&#8217;re not personality-wise &#8211; you get found out eventually! It&#8217;s so tiring to keep up the facade consistently.</li>
<li>Following general marketing gurus and social media &#8216;experts&#8217; on Twitter.</li>
<li>Following lots and lots of people on Twitter &#8211; signal to noise ratio gets less and less favourable, even though your follow stats are high. They aren&#8217;t really a targeted audience.</li>
<li>Premium, i.e. paid-for, online portfolio/cv sites &#8211; e.g. Productionbase</li>
<li>&#8220;Working the Room&#8221; at industry networking events &#8211; no real, viable relationships formed as a result of constantly looking for instant &#8216;usefulness&#8217; indicators in conversations, looking over shoulders at other people who might be more &#8216;useful.&#8221; This behavior doesn&#8217;t really give the best impression.</li>
<li>Music &#8220;giveaways.&#8221; I tried this once and it didn&#8217;t work&#8230; but it might next time.</li>
<li>Myspace page (although I didn&#8217;t put a lot of effort into it)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Stuff I haven&#8217;t tried yet so can&#8217;t say either way. But these tips might send your business into the stratosphere, so am not ruling them out yet:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Professional logo design.</li>
<li>Headshots/professional photography (technically I have but it was for a different business &#8211; a live string group &#8211; and wasn&#8217;t really the right style for what I wanted to promote for my freelance composition).</li>
<li>Professional web design.</li>
<li>Hired professional PR and marketing services.</li>
<li>Email list marketing (round-robins, news updates)</li>
<li>Using bookmarking sites and comments on other blogs to drive traffic to my site (not intentionally anyway)</li>
<li>Paid-for ghostwriters for blog content.</li>
<li>Paid advertisements &#8211; e.g. Telephone directories on and offline, in trade magazines, on relevant trade websites.</li>
<li>Real-world thank you notes (vs email, which I actually do quite a lot).</li>
<li>Professionally printed branded headed note paper, &#8216;with compliments&#8217; slips, holiday cards etc.</li>
<li>Pursuing the press e.g. having a press pack ready, calling the press with a pre-made story or angle.</li>
<li>Video interviews/vlog (e.g. on your blog).</li>
<li>Branded associated merchandise &#8211; hats, cups, tshirts, bags, stuffed animals&#8230;</li>
<li>Reverbnation page (technically I&#8217;ve got a page. but I&#8217;ve not put anything of interest on it. So can&#8217;t really claim to be an authority on this one)</li>
<li>Publicity &#8220;stunts.&#8221;</li>
<li>Cold-calling production companies. (I take the easy route and ask my working friends and colleagues who I&#8217;ve met through networking or working alongside in related media who work at those companies, what&#8217;s going on there. So, technically, it&#8217;s warm-calling).</li>
</ul>
<h1>Final word &#8211; and this is as technical as I&#8217;m going to get&#8230;</h1>
<p>As media composers and sound designers, we are B2B &#8211; business to business &#8211; rather than B2C &#8211; business to consumer. We sell our services or our previously composed music to producers of other media as raw material for them to sculpt into the product that will be sold to the consumer &#8211; the audience. So a lot of the advice for marketing for musicians you may find on the web or offline, unless specifically for media music composers and sound designers, isn&#8217;t actually that relevant.</p>
<p>Ultimately, rather than focussing on the product, we&#8217;re aiming to be service providers &#8211; you&#8217;re selling you: your working personality, your style of collaboration, your creativity-on-tap. You can&#8217;t really afford to just let the music &#8216;speak for itself&#8217;. That&#8217;s your past. What you&#8217;re selling is in your future. Who you are as an artist. Your creative soul.</p>
<p>If that doesn&#8217;t scare you then you&#8217;re probably in the right business. Go get &#8217;em, tiger.</p>
<p><strong>Which marketing strategies do you use? What&#8217;s worked and what hasn&#8217;t? What would you add to these lists, and what points here are you inspired to take away and implement immediately? Tell us in the comments below.</strong></p>

		<description><![CDATA[I often get asked for a checklist of things one can do to break in to the business. Here is my personal "top ten" of lessons learned.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I frequently get emails from burgeoning composers and new Los Angeles transplants either looking for a composer assistant position or just advice on breaking into the industry.  I often agree to meet them (usually over lunch) and invariably get asked if it&#8217;s beneficial to assist and/or ghostwrite for a bigger name composer.  The advice I give them is almost always the same.  It comes from my own years of experience working hard to establish myself in the composer world.  A feat that I feel is not only difficult, but one most all of us are ever in the constant pursuit of doing.</p>
<h4>10 Lessons on &#8220;Breaking In&#8221;</h4>
<p>I learn something new on every film and further hone my craft and skill with each project.  There are some truly fundamental things I have learned in the last few years.  Many years ago, fresh out of USC&#8217;s Scoring for Motion Pictures and Television Program, I was given one particular piece of advice, from a highly respected composer that influenced me greatly as I set out on my composing career.  I would like to share this advice as well as some of my own lessons with you.  Here is my &#8220;top ten&#8221; list of lessons learned while breaking into the industry as a composer.</p>
<h5><em>1) You have to break into the business of tomorrow, not the business of today.</em></h5>
<p>Basil Poledouris said that. Today&#8217;s working directors and producers already have established composer relationships they go back to over and over. You have to find the up and coming directors and producers of &#8220;tomorrow&#8221; and work with them now before they make it in Hollywood. When they eventually get their first studio gig, they will usually go back to the people they know and trust from when they were struggling themselves. Hopefully you will be one of those people on their team.</p>
<h5><em>2) Everyone&#8217;s path is different.</em></h5>
<p>So don&#8217;t think if you do what the guy next to you is doing, you will get the same result.  Some composers are at the right place (or on the right film) at the right time, and their preparation synergistically meets with their opportunity.  Some pound the grind stone for years and years before getting noticed.  Careers are like snowflakes.  No two career paths are alike.</p>
<h5><em>3) Set a precedent as Department Head.</em></h5>
<p>Music Composer (as on-screen credited on a film or show) is a &#8220;department head&#8221; job. The only way you will get bigger and better department head jobs (on multi-million dollar films) is to have a proven track record AS A DEPARTMENT HEAD on previous SUCCESSFUL films. Being the composer&#8217;s assistant, ghostwriter, orchestrator or musician on studio films do not count as a DEPARTMENT HEAD and will not help a studio see you as less of a risk in the composer job. I have learned this from 4 different studio level producers. This is all I have been hearing for the last 8-9 years.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, composer assistants, orchestrators, etc&#8230;are positions to be respected and it is valid work.  It just usually does not lead to a career as the lead composer.  And it certainly will not give you the freedom to develop your own &#8220;sound&#8221; which is also very important in building your brand as a composer.   Remember, your sound is what you will get hired for.</p>
<h5><em>4) Main title, on-screen credits matter most.</em></h5>
<p>If you are not the on-screen credited person, the credit really will not count to a producer hiring you to be their lead composer.  This is a subtle difference.  Again&#8230;working under the wing of another composer is valuable experience and work to be proud of, but you were not the lead composer in charge.  Your reputation was not the one on the line.  It is that on-screen, single, main title card credit of &#8220;music by&#8230;&#8221; that really matters most on your resumé.</p>
<h5><em>5) Recommendations are key.</em></h5>
<p>A word of mouth recommendation is a more powerful influence to getting a gig than anything else. If you get a strong recommendation from someone a director or producer respects, they will hire you nine times out of ten. One job truly leads to the next in this business.  And it is not just about getting &#8220;the gig&#8221; but also getting their next gig.  If the people you are working for hire you over and over again, you are probably doing something right.  If not, you may have to do some self evaluation.</p>
<h5><em>6) The entertainment industry is a business of relationships.</em></h5>
<p>Those relationships take years to establish. Trust takes a long time to build and a short time to fall.  You better be in this for the long haul.  Do not expect to arrive in town and think you are going to quickly find work.  It may take a good 5-7 years to start composing on films where people will start to notice you and another 5-7 to build off of that.  Ask yourself, are you in this for the long haul?</p>
<h5><em>7) Be a good listener. Be a good communicator.</em></h5>
<p>I could go on and on about this one in an article by itself. But to be successful in your job, you will have to be a master at both of these tasks.</p>
<h5><em>8) Be &#8220;production friendly.&#8221;</em></h5>
<p>Meaning&#8230; don&#8217;t be myopic to the music department issues only. Learn about every other step of the process in making a film. Heck&#8230;produce your own film sometime to learn about all the other issues one has to deal with in shooting and budgeting for a film. It will not only help you better communicate with a director as the composer, but it WILL make you a better composer in the long run. You will understand where everyone has just come from on a shoot and why things are the way they are in Post (which is usually the only thing composers care about).</p>
<h5><em>9) You must be well rounded in your skills.</em></h5>
<p>A successful composer in Hollywood is not just successful because they are good at composing music. Most all of them are great business people as well. They know how to market themselves. They know how to work a room at a meeting or at a social event. And, they know how to make a director feel like their film is the best film of the year. I know plenty of great composers.  The ones who do not make it usually fail due to issues completely unrelated to being a composer. The ones who have made it to various degrees (while competent in their craft) were not always the best composers&#8230;but were great at all of the other things. They were pleasant to be around and had a work ethic and professionalism that pushed them above the rest.  And thus&#8230;they kept getting hired.</p>
<h5><em>10) Refer back to #1.</em></h5>
<p>Holding true to these lessons over the last few years while working and following my own path has led me to conclude that doing my own music, developing my own sound, and networking to get my own composer gigs was the path for me. Maybe it isn&#8217;t for you. Perhaps you may want to experience the industry from the perspective of being someone&#8217;s assistant for a while; you can obtain real world experience and at least make a living while working in the field of music. Again for me, I would much rather spend all of my time on building my own credit list, reputation and skills as the lead composer.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Advanced technology has merely enabled us to be efficient, but composing music for media is much more than efficiency.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/01/sig-bellis.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1060" title="sig-bellis" alt="Richard Bellis—SCOREcast composing" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/01/sig-bellis.jpg" width="136" height="136" /></a>When stores or online shopping sites offer something at a “sale” price they always show the “regular” price for comparison.  If there is no comparative regular price then the shopper perceives the value or worth of the item to be the price shown.</p>
<p>If the current composing community was comprised solely of a limited number of veteran composers, adjustments in the price of a film score—either due to the economy or because the composer just wanted to do a particular low-budget project—would be made based on a reduction of their regular price. However, with so many of the available composers being of emerging status or those just starting to build their career, and without a regular or established price or the representation to engage in negotiations, the price too often becomes whatever is perceived as a “competitive edge” (currently zero dollars with IMDB credit).  This, then, becomes an industry norm and is perceived to be the value or worth of music for that particular category of media.</p>
<p>Deane Ogden makes a good point in his SCOREcast article <em><a href="../../../2010/12/deane-ogden-community-counts.html" target="_blank">Community Counts</a></em>.  Advanced technology has merely enabled us to be efficient, but composing music for film is much more than efficiency.  It is the composer’s ability to diagnose how much music and of what kind the music should be.  Then to create, not from whatever samples are available but from one’s musical background and intellect, the perfect score for that production—and that particular film maker.  And, in addition, to offer input to that filmmaker even when he/she may not agree.  This last duty, if not coming from a place of experience, must then rely upon an extensive backlog of viewing and analysis of film scores coupled with the tact and charm of presentation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Let’s “re-sophisticate” our profession.</p></blockquote>
<p>Two of the four words above deserve some reflection—<em>Sophisticate</em> and <em>Profession</em>.</p>
<h2>Defining the Role of Composing</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Artist</strong> = An unrestricted creative</li>
<li><strong>Artisan</strong> = Creativity with functionality</li>
<li><strong>Professional</strong> = (used as a noun)  Highly educated, mostly salaried workers, who enjoy considerable work autonomy, a comfortable salary, and are commonly engaged in creative and intellectually challenging work. Less technically, it may also refer to a person having impressive competence in a particular activity.</li>
<li><strong>Profession</strong> = A calling requiring specialized knowledge and often long and intensive academic preparation.</li>
<li><strong>Craftsperson</strong> = A person who practices a craft with great skill.  Creates to specification.</li>
<li><strong>Worker</strong> = A person who is employed to do physical or mental work for wages.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to think of composing for media as neither the first nor the last of the definitions above.  I’m afraid that we might be slipping toward the “worker” category due to a perception stemming from technology and supply-and-demand ratios.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sophistication</strong> (Synonyms)<br />
—refinement<br />
—elegance<br />
—finesse<br />
—poise<br />
—tact</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sophistication</strong> (Definition)<br />
— sophisticated character, ideas, tastes, or ways as the result of education, worldly experience, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, the hardware and software with which we work is sophisticated but it is also readily available to everyone &#8211; including the film maker (think Garage Band and Apple Loops).</p>
<p>The <em>sophistication of our profession</em> comes from our experience as players and listeners; our musical education; our musical taste and our ability to write only what is needed and no more (a.k.a. discrimination).  Hardware, software and the people to operate them are in plentiful supply but the musical and mental skill-sets of a true media composer are what is rarer and of greatest value.</p>
<p>What we, as composers, need to focus on are the skills and talents which cannot be purchased online or in a music equipment store.  As “machine operators” we are worth slightly more than minimum wage, but as professionals we are worth what I consider to be far more appropriate compensation.</p>
<p>What do <em>you</em> think?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The road to Unionization isn't simply paved with negotiations about pension and benefits... It is about the core definition of what we do as media composers and how we are perceived by those who hire us to accomplish that work.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Employment = Money</h4>
<p>The employer is offering to give an employee money. The negotiation centers around whether or not the potential employee is willing to do the things required in order to accept that money. This negotiation is uneven from its very inception. The potential employee is obviously not currently employed or he/she would not be looking for employment. This gives the significant advantage to the employer.</p>
<p>When many people are unemployed either due to an economic state such as we are currently experiencing or, due to an abundance of potential employees such as the composer community is currently experiencing, the employer’s advantage increases.</p>
<p>What people are willing to put up with in order to land that job, varies. We might think of this as people with various pain thresholds.</p>
<p>So, what mechanism is necessary to “level the playing field” between employer and potential employee?</p>
<p>In the United States there are two statuses for workers designed to act as equalizers. The first of these is the official status, “Employee”. In its purest sense, employee status is given to those who meet certain criteria such as (but not limited to) being told where and when to do their work and being provided the tools with which to do that work. Workers who are deemed &#8220;Employees&#8221; are allowed to collectively bargain with the employer and are afforded a benefits package consisting of a pension or retirement fund and some kind of healthcare coverage. Those employees who create something as part of their job description are, most often, required to concede ownership rights to the employer.</p>
<p>The second status, for those who do not meet the Employee criteria, is “Independent Contractor”. Independent contractors who create something actually do own it. It is that ownership and the subsequent negotiation for access to that which has been created—either by license or sale—which is considered the equalizing factor for the independent contractor.</p>
<p>Composers and lyricists who worked on the studio lot in the forties and fifties, writing on paper provided by the studio and working in an office and on a piano or typewriter which the studio owned, were considered <em>Employees</em> and consequently allowed to form a guild or union and collectively bargain with their employers.</p>
<p>Today, there would be reason for great deliberation over which classification (Employee or Independent Contractor) would be most beneficial to media composers and lyricists if it wasn’t for one significant wrinkle: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Work-Made-For-Hire</em></span>.</p>
<p>Without going into the establishment of <em>Work-Made-For-Hire</em>, suffice it to say that it is today, for media composers in all but the most innocent or ignorant production circumstances, a “condition of employment”.</p>
<p>Here, then, is the situation in which media composers and lyricists find themselves:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">We are currently Independent Contractors working under a Work-Made-for-Hire agreement (the contract document is the Certificate of Authorship). The result of this is to strip the Independent Contractor of ownership making him/her a “temporary” Employee without the right to collectively bargain nor the benefits package normally appropriate for Employees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is, for the media composer/lyricist, the worst of both worlds. For the employer, it is the best of both worlds thereby increasing the employer’s advantage exponentially.</p>
<p>The possibility of overturning work-made-for-hire is remote as it is part of the U.S. Copyright Act. The possibility of becoming, officially, <em>Employees</em>, and achieving the right to collectively bargain and receive benefits is before us and obtainable.</p>
<p>The status quo should not be a consideration as it offers us a continuation of hybrid status which only benefits the employer in what can only be considered a “buyer’s market”.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/11/sig-ralston1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-956" title="sig-ralston" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/11/sig-ralston1.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>That is the question.</p>
<p>Lately, I have been talking to some industry friends of mine about their career philosophies and techniques for getting work. And while everyone has a different take on how they approach their careers, one fact to getting work seems to remain true among most all of them: Being busy seems to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>The individuals who go from one job to the next and have their year of work ahead planned out seem to further benefit from the very fact that they are busy. I was speaking with a good friend of mine who is a well respected Hollywood producer and he was discussing hiring crew for a film. The director of a film he is working on said he wanted to hire a specific production designer and that they had to make this person an offer early because they are busy. They wanted to &#8220;lock them in&#8221; early so they would not lose them to another project six months from now when they would actually need their services. In turn, my producer friend said he wanted to bring in and introduce a sound designer that the director had not worked with before and he was able to use the &#8220;busy&#8221; argument for her as well, even though she would not be needed until post-production even further down the line.</p>
<p>You see, this sound designer is busy. She seems to go from film to film. Some of her films you have never heard of. Some go to Sundance every year. Some of her work even stretches into the video game world. Regardless of the type of project, the very fact that she is always working puts her in a position to get an early offer for more work.</p>
<p>The executive producer said, &#8220;Well&#8230;she is always busy, so she must be good. Let&#8217;s get her.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have always felt that there is a fine line between being busy and building a credit list that is respectable and ever-increasing in size and scope. I have carefully chosen the projects I have worked on and have gone after specifically because I want each project to not only be one people respect, but to also be bigger in budget and scope than the last one. But there is a fine line: One can&#8217;t let the fear of remaining stagnant in their careers keep them from getting work, either. There has to be some middle ground.</p>
<p>I do not subscribe to the philosophy that you never turn down work. Sometimes the film or project may not be a good fit for you creatively and if your career is going to be hurt by your involvement, perhaps it is not a project worth taking on. Also, you may have certain financial obligations that prohibit you from taking some jobs that may—how should I say this?—<em>require</em> you to become an investor in the film. We have all been there.</p>
<p>Then again, if you are not busy and the phone isn&#8217;t ringing as much as you would like (especially in this economy), perhaps being busy, regardless of the type of project, would be a <em>good</em> thing. It creates momentum. Being busy creates demand for your work. As humans, we subconsciously see what everyone else is getting and we want that, too. Ultimately, you do want to create demand for yourself and your music, and perhaps the simple act of being a busy composer, regardless of what you are busy with&#8230; will do that for you.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on being busy? Tell me in the COMMENTS below.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In our industry, it's go, go, go, go, go, and go some more. How long can you drive on one tank of gas?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had a conversation recently with a fellow film composer about &#8220;creative burnout&#8221;. This person isn&#8217;t feeling it anymore. He told me that the years of rejection and rewrites have eroded his ambition and he just doesn&#8217;t find it exhilarating the way he once did. I listened as he told me about gigs come and gone and what he loved about them versus the gigs of late and what he loathed about those. He talked about how things have changed in film music; how he felt it is no longer financially possible to record a decent orchestra, convince a director to go with a melody over a drone, or make it through an entire film without competing with needle drops for a money-grabbing soundtrack release. To be honest, his long tale of discontent made me very sad and a little uncomfortable. It was a dreary story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Basically,&#8221; he summarized, &#8220;I&#8217;m tired of eating, sleeping, breathing, and living film music only to have to &#8216;write down&#8217; and pander to the new philosophy of how Hollywood churns out movies.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A fair sentiment. I mean, I think we&#8217;ve all felt that way at one time or another. I tried to encourage him as much as possible, but to be perfectly honest, I wasn&#8217;t much help. His mind was made up. He was done. We ended there and went our separate ways with a promise to get together in a few months for lunch.</p>
<p>But, the last comment he made—the one about <em>eating, sleeping, breathing, and living film music</em>—something about that statement really bothered me. I thought about weeks after, constantly. How could you ever feel that way about something you love so much? What would have to happen in order for you to become so fed up with a passion that you were willing to never do it again? Worse yet: <em>What would have to happen to ME</em> to get to that place?</p>
<p>I had a thought about it a few days ago: Maybe my friend is being shortsighted and placing undue blame on things that don&#8217;t warrant it. Maybe his problem is <em>not</em> with the decline of finances in music budgets or his perceived lack of film music savvy among directors and producers. What if his issues are systemic of the fact that he literally <em>eats</em>, <em>sleeps</em>, <em>breathes</em>, and <em>lives</em> film music&#8230; 24-hours a day? If he is <em>that</em> consumed by the DOING of film music, how could he expect any other result BUT career burnout? Thinking about that for a few minutes led me to a conclusion I&#8217;d like to share with you here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">My thought: Instead of eating, sleeping, breathing, and living film music, why not eat, sleep, breathe, and live&#8230;.<br />
and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>THEN</em></span> write film music?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Saying this will probably get me in trouble with my manager (who rides my ass like Zorro to &#8220;write, write, write!&#8221;), but if all you do is <em>write</em>—to the exclusion of everything else in your life—then your music is going to be void of any real meaning or context. <em>Your life IS your music</em>. In fact, what goes into making YOU is as vital as every other piece of your film music education, and perhaps more important altogether. It is the essence of who you are as a Creative. If you don&#8217;t refuel regularly, you WILL burn out. It is not a question of <em>if</em>, but a question of <em>when</em>. It is inevitable.</p>
<p>In thinking about this concept of eating, sleeping, breathing, and living—all four of them mandatory for human sustenance—let&#8217;s look at each one individually and try to determine exactly how crucial a role they play in our lives as Creatives.</p>
<h2>EAT</h2>
<p>The human body needs to be fed. It just does. You cannot get away from that. Even in a vegetative state, your body needs to be constantly revitalized with nutrients. In turn, those nutrients balance the metabolism and create healthful stability. But it all starts with the action of <em>eating</em>, whether voluntary or forced.</p>
<p>Question: How do you feed your creativity? How do you insure that your creativity is continually being provided with a nutritious, balanced diet? When was the last time you just <em>ingested some music</em>? When did you last <em>devour an opera</em>, <em>consume a well-crafted pop tune</em>, or <em>gorge on a brilliant film score</em>? In order to put out, you have to put in. Much like your body needs to consume fuel in order to continue operating every day, your musical metabolism also needs to be fed and maintained regularly. Many of us are educated musicians, but our formal training most likely fell off shortly after graduation, and what ever methods we&#8217;ve employed in our &#8220;continued education&#8221; have been only those borne out of the jobs we&#8217;ve managed to wrangle. If you are a film composer that is hired again and again for the same types of things (which many are), the importance of a regular refresh is even more important.</p>
<p>I have always been a voracious student of music, and it has served me well. There is an old adage: If you stop learning, you stop leading.&#8221; Thanks to the investment of my parents in my musical upbringing, I developed early on the discipline in my life that I refer to as <em>critical listening</em>. When I&#8217;m not crunching a deadline, I spend a solid hour every morning just critically listening to the music of others. Sometimes it is something new I&#8217;ve discovered, other times it is an old favorite. Whatever the case, I listen&#8230; but even more, I consciously choose to <em>mentally notice</em>. I don&#8217;t do this during any other activity. For example, I never do this while I&#8217;m cleaning the studio, cutting demos, or writing emails. I sit in a specific chair, in a specific place on my property, at a specific time every morning, and I just <em>listen</em>. It is my way of keeping the fuel tank full at all times, so that when I am called upon to spill out my most creative musical effort, there is plenty to go around.</p>
<p>Since we can only compose what we can think to compose, replenishing your creative reserve tank is not an option. <a href="../../../2010/07/deane-ogden-the-creative-tank.html" target="_blank">I wrote about this in a little more depth a while back</a>. Keeping current with musical trends and keeping your creative cabinets well stocked is vital to staving off burnout. If you constantly give and give and give and give, you&#8217;ll run out of steam sooner or later. Try to find a way to put back what you take out&#8230; and try to do this on a daily basis if you can.</p>
<h2>SLEEP</h2>
<p><strong></strong>Current scientific sleep studies reveal that most people get less than six hours of sleep per night. To a composer, that almost sounds like a luxury! Dig a little deeper and you&#8217;ll discover a more interesting component of the same study: People with careers in functional fields require less sleep than people with careers in creative fields. Counting money as a banker for eight hours a day requires a completely different skill-set than twelve hours of painting a picture will. However, painting a picture is a lot less mechanical of a task, and therefore, requires a little bit more fluidity of motion, process organization, emotion, and planning. In other words, Creatives need more sleep than Tradesmen do.</p>
<p>Years ago, I began getting extremely tired during the day while I was writing music. I would get a full night&#8217;s sleep, but then during the day it was as if I hadn&#8217;t slept at all. It started with just chronic yawning, which I didn&#8217;t think anything of—but then it developed into me literally not being able to keep my eyes open at 2pm on a sunny afternoon. Something was definitely wrong. I saw a fatigue specialist who determined that I had developed <em>obstructive sleep apnea</em> (OSA). OSA is condition by which your breathing airflow is actually cut-off while you sleep, resulting in numerous &#8220;wake-ups&#8221; throughout the night. Mine got to be so bad that I eventually went into the hospital for a sleep study where they hooked me up to all kinds of diodes and monitored me sleeping for a full two nights. What they found was unbelievable: The first night, I woke up 284 times in a 7-hour cycle. The second night was worse: I woke up 582 in an 8-hour cycle. Something needed to be done, so I underwent some treatments, and now I sleep like a dead guy every night.</p>
<p>These days, my sleep pattern is probably better than yours is—and you might be 22 years old and in perfect health! Regardless, I still need to get a full night&#8217;s sleep or I start running the risk of being slow during the day and generally off my game. It is a proven fact that not getting enough sleep can lead to bouts of depression, lack of stamina during the work day, self-doubt and drops in self-esteem, and sharp overall decreases in productivity. Lack of sleep will also make you irritable, short-tempered, given to fits of spontaneous anger and outbursts. As you might imagine, these are not the kinds of qualities that the people who are making composer decisions in the major motion picture studios are going to want to contend with.</p>
<p>Over the years of doing this gig, I&#8217;ve heard lots of people say a lot of different things in regards to what the right time to work on music is. Some say that they are better in the morning, while others swear by the quiet hours between 1am and 7am. We&#8217;ve all heard people say &#8220;I can&#8217;t get up in the morning. I&#8217;m just not a morning person.&#8221; Scientifically speaking, however, I&#8217;m not convinced that &#8220;can&#8217;t&#8221; is a reality. If you are the kind of composer who always says, &#8220;I&#8217;m just better at night!&#8221;, then I call bullshit. Listen, if there was an 8.5 earthquake in your city, we all know your ass would be up and at &#8217;em like Private Pyle in &#8220;Full Metal Jacket&#8221;! Getting up in the morning or going to bed at a decent time at night are simply two disciplines that are not unlike any other discipline you have surely made time for in your busy, busy life.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another interesting thing to consider: Most sleep specialists and biochemical scientists agree that no matter what time you go to bed, if you are asleep between the hours of 11pm and 2am, you have rested as much as your body needs for a full 10-hour day following that sleep cycle. There is something about the planet&#8217;s biorhythms during that particular time of night that lends  to solid <em>rest</em>. You could get up at 3am, and within minutes, be working just like you would be had you slept eight hours from 1am on. Sound too crazy to be true? Try it. DVR that Jimmy Fallon episode and go to bed. Try it for a week and see if you don&#8217;t come back to your writing refreshed and re-energized after a week.</p>
<h2>BREATH</h2>
<p><strong></strong>Another curse of being a Creative is that much of what you stress out about is brought on by panic. If you&#8217;ve been at this awhile, you&#8217;ve by now realized that as a person who earns their bread by &#8220;making stuff&#8221;, it is pretty much feast or famine in regards to resources. Everything hinges on where that next gig is coming from, and sometimes that can be an awfully stressful position to be in. To avoid burning out from lack of work (which might be the most common form of burn-out there is), it is critical that you learn to ebb and flow with the ever-changing tides of the film business. Panic will get you nowhere fast. In fact, if you avoid dealing with your lack of coping skills in regards to not keeping busy, eventually you&#8217;ll just up and quit. I cannot tell you how many people I know that have thrown in the towel because they couldn&#8217;t stand the heat of an unknown future.</p>
<p>In the film industry especially, nothing—NOTHING—is ever certain, and even after you&#8217;ve signed on the dotted line the possibility of being edged out by some random act of nepotism is stock-in-trade in Hollywood. When these types of things happen, your initial reaction will usually be to either get very angry or panic and start freaking out after the reality of not feeding your family for the next however-many-months sets in. Or&#8230; BOTH.</p>
<p>The best advice I&#8217;ve ever received about getting bad news or finding out that things aren&#8217;t going to work out as well as you might have counted on&#8230; is to <em>take a breath and relax</em> for a minute. If you can, it is even better to sleep on it. &#8220;Things are always better the next day,&#8221; my dad used to say. And that&#8217;s true. Stepping away from the drama and realizing that you are going to live to die another day is probably the best way to deal with immediate stress. Not to be preachy, but alcohol, drugs, and other substances are not the way to take the edge off of anxiety. They might work in the interim, but that&#8217;s it. It will run out fast, and then&#8230; there you are. Creatives have no room in their lives for false emotional boosters or suppressants. It&#8217;s just not how we are built. Your <em><strong>mind</strong></em> is the single most important emotional regulator available to you. And it&#8217;s free! Use it to your advantage and allow it to sooth and calm you during stressful moments.</p>
<h2>LIVE</h2>
<p><strong></strong>Lastly, doing nothing but outputting just takes a serious toll over time. You have to find a way to generate as much input into your life as you produce output, if not more.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s creative climate of pressure and immediacy (filmmaker Robert Rodriguez refers to it as &#8220;creation at the speed of thought&#8221;), there isn&#8217;t much time for what those of us in the Millennial Generation would term as &#8220;restful minutes&#8221; (thank you, Stephen Covey!). There is no such thing as a &#8220;power nap&#8221; anymore. People don&#8217;t soak in the tub to take the edge off. Walking around the block to get the creative juices flowing fast again is unheard of in most Creative&#8217;s schedules. Why? Because we lack margin in our lives to the point that we simply don&#8217;t have the time it would take to do any of those things. Facebook, Twitter, and texting now occupy the emotional bandwidth formerly used to &#8220;unwind&#8221; and the business climate demands that we be on a greenlight schedule 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Not a good recipe for longevity!</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Rest</em></span></h3>
<p>Speaking of technology, when was the last time you read a book? Not an &#8220;eBook&#8221;&#8230; I mean one with paper and a hardback cover? A recent poll discovered that 9 out of 10 people do 100% of their reading online. That&#8217;s cool for the environment, but not so great for the brain. You might say, &#8220;Well, now that I have my iPad, it has become a much more organic experience.&#8221; To which I would say, &#8220;Maybe a little.&#8221; Even still, there is great divide between reading at a book&#8217;s pace, and reading at an iPad&#8217;s pace. You see, the very idea of an iPad is &#8220;convenience&#8221;. Printed books are not, by today&#8217;s standards, in any way <em>convenient</em>. Shopping is not <em>convenient</em> either, hence the rise in Internet commerce in the last five years.</p>
<p>Understand, I&#8217;m not advocating against the Internet or iPads. I use them every day myself. But I also understand the difference in the quality of life that balancing technology will bring. The contrast between reading a printed book in a hammock versus reading an iPad book on the subway. HUGE difference in takeaway velocity. Or the wonder of getting outside and being around people at the supermarket versus buying groceries online because it&#8217;s convenient and &#8220;cool&#8221; to do so.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Communication</em></span></h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s another example: Communication. Most people in my life would rather text me than talk to me. I hate that. You know why? Because there are little to no consequences when you &#8220;text&#8221; someone. It&#8217;s safe. You don&#8217;t have to see the distasteful look on my face when I don&#8217;t agree with what they are texting me. Texting is low-risk. Texting doesn&#8217;t cost you anything. There is zero social output, so there is zero social input. It&#8217;s boring, detached, and easy to ignore.</p>
<p>Perhaps the bigger problem is that texting is also easy to screw up. It is by far easier to miscommunicate in a text than if you and I are standing next to each other, or even talking to one another over a phone line.</p>
<p>There are essentially three parts to communicating effectively:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Words</em>—What you say is important and carries the overall meaning of what you are trying to convey through your communication.</li>
<li><em>Tone of Voice</em>—The way you say something is as important as what you are saying, isn&#8217;t it? How many times have you received a text message from someone where you weren&#8217;t sure if they were pissed off or joking? Most times, if you could hear the tone of their voice, it would remove all doubt.</li>
<li><em>Body Language</em>—Same idea as &#8220;tone of voice&#8221;. Someone saying, &#8220;Wow, you look nice!&#8221; with a smile on their face is completely different from them saying, &#8220;Wow, you look nice!&#8221; with one eyebrow raised and pursed lips. One communicates a genuine compliment of your tastes. (&#8220;Damn, she/he looks great in that!&#8221;) The other, a mockery of your wardrobe choice. (&#8220;What the hell was she/he thinking wearing THAT?&#8221;)</li>
</ol>
<p>Yet, we communicate like this all of the time, and it leads to a disconnect with people and to a lack of fundamental interactive communication skills. Hearing someone&#8217;s voice or seeing someone&#8217;s face is a joyous luxury that we are dangerously close to losing in our culture of convenience. It is the experience of being with someone and really spending the time that is fading away. Many of us have had the experience of working with filmmakers from a remote location. Or maybe you&#8217;ve recorded an orchestral ensemble in Prague or Moscow and have had to communicate with the conductor over an ISDN line from your studio. If you have, then you know that, while it is wonderful that the technology enables you to do that, a lot gets lost in digital translation. Communicating, which should be effortless and simple, gets complicated and difficult when you are not IN THE ROOM with the people you are working with.</p>
<p>Returning to our context, learning the art of human-to-human communication will do wonders for your nerves.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Interaction</em></span></h3>
<p>Ever wonder why most agents and execs dread sitting in a meeting with a composer? Bingo! Composers sit&#8230; in a room&#8230; with no people&#8230; 10-18 hours a day. After awhile of living within that kind of a vacuum, your sphere of influence is greatly inhibited and your studio becomes a bubble that regulates what you can know, learn, and understand.</p>
<p>I saw this concept in action recently as I sat down to talk with a young man fresh out of college and eager to get started in the world of film composing. He told me that he had just come from three solid months of having his nose in the books, closing out his time at music school, with Facebook serving as his only connection to the outside world, and an occasional one at that. As we talked about the business and his hopes and dreams as a composer, he asked me all kinds of questions about the future of the industry. While making a point, I casually mentioned the current effort on behalf of composers to unionize with the Teamsters. His eyes glazed over. Because he&#8217;d had little to no interaction with actual carbon-based lifeforms for twelve weeks, he had no idea that there was even an effort underway to unionize. He was clueless.</p>
<p>I also had an intern once who couldn&#8217;t offer an opinion to save his life. ANYONE could asked this guy for his opinion and he could not string a two-sentence answer together if his life depended on it. After awhile of trying to get him to not be so anxious around others, it became clear that he was a long way from overcoming his problem: Fear of others. He was, essentially, an isolationist. Even though he was a quick on his feet in the studio and seemed do well around me and the rest of our team, being put on the spot and expected to perform was like garlic to a vampire to this poor kid. Instead of giving up on him by relegating him to title of &#8220;Dry Cleaning Picker-Upper&#8221;, my solution was to take him <em>everywhere</em> with me until being in groups of people became second nature to him. And I did. I took him to meetings, I took him to lunches, I took him to mix stages. I took him anywhere that I felt would put him in a position to give an occasional opinion. Even when there was no opportunity for him to do that, I tried to fabricate an oppotunity that would force him to voice an opinion. My job as his mentor that summer, as I saw it, was less about film music and more about how to interact with other humans. To this day, he would tell you that his time spent at Deane Ogden Music forced him to &#8220;learn how to communicate with others.&#8221; I&#8217;m proud of that, and I think it has given him a better shot at the prize, whatever road he chooses to follow in life.</p>
<p>Interaction with others is a crucial implement in the toolbox of a film composer. Without it you honestly don&#8217;t stand a chance because the cornerstone of our business—what makes it hum—is <em>personal relationships</em>. Without the skills necessary to build personal relationships, a composer will never get through a first meeting, a director will never make it through pre-production with a producing team, and an agent/manager will never get you a gig. Period.</p>
<p>In order to build those relationships, you have to <em>get out there</em>. You have to LIVE. Not in a cocoon, not in a bubble, not in your studio. OUT. In the world. Where the action is happening. Don&#8217;t be fooled by those who try to convince you that you can do everything now in front of a monitor. They are only saying that so that you&#8217;ll spend all your time <em>in front of a monitor</em>&#8230; while they are out there making things happen!</p>
<h2>Burnproof</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve said all of this to get at this point: If you don&#8217;t take the time to have a life, there will be no life in your writing, and therefore, no life in your career. You WILL burn out, no question. Creatives who do nothing but sit at their computers and play with software, broken up by the occasional Facebook status update, cannot be that interesting, and therefore, their output won&#8217;t be either. No studio film music executive will tolerate a 30-minute meeting where the composer sits there and stares at the floor the entire time. By the same token, no director worth his or her salt will accept shallow-sounding music that comes from a composer with little or no life experience.</p>
<p>Bottom line: When it&#8217;s business time, it&#8217;s business time. When it&#8217;s not business time, redeem <em>that</em> time with restoration and recovery for both yourself AND the people in your life that are close to you, be it your family, your friends, whatever. When I come off a project, I&#8217;m creatively drained. I am doing myself, my future employers, and my family a disservice if I don&#8217;t take some time to re-energize.</p>
<p>Consuming new music is important for creative longevity, getting enough sleep is vital to good health, and taking a non-dramatic approach to stress will keep you in this for the long haul. None of these things are a waste of time for a Creative. In fact, any time &#8220;lost&#8221; from doing them is not really time &#8220;lost&#8221; but time invested, and it&#8217;s worth it. You have to be able to <em>really live</em> in order to be able to <em>really write</em>. It is these seemingly little things that add up in the long run and will contribute to your overall health as a Creative professional. And listen&#8230; The way I&#8217;ve outlined incorporating some of these things into your life might not be the most useful to you, but the principles apply down the line, no matter what your situation is. What is important is that you have as much input as you do output. It is all about safeguarding yourself from creative burnout.</p>
<p>What do <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>you</strong></em></span> do to &#8220;re-energize&#8221; your creativity and keep from burning out?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s hard to talk about what you <strong><em>suck</em></strong> at. It&#8217;s no fun. Nonetheless, it is vital if you want to grow and get better. The tough thing about your own weaknesses is that you are usually the last person to identify them, and it seems like others can sometimes be just a liiiiiiitle too happy to point them out to you—usually when you really don&#8217;t want to hear them!</p>
<p>Learning how to identify and examine your weaknesses as a composer, mixer, orchestrator, editor, player, copyist, manager/agent, executive&#8230; whatever, is an important step in creating the career you&#8217;ve always wanted. However, it doesn&#8217;t end there. If you really want to move yourself to the next level, not only do you have to figure out what your weaknesses are, but then you have to find a way to <em>conquer</em> them. You have to follow through on a solution if you want achieve more for yourself.</p>
<p>With that: <em>What is your biggest weakness?</em> And more importantly, <em>how do you plan to conquer it?</em></p>

Be careful how you answer this one: We are certainly aware of the risk involved in even putting this question out there—we are inviting a deluge of the token <em>&#8220;writing music is who I am&#8221;</em> comments.</p>
<p>If we are honest, though, simply <em>writing</em> is not the primary motivator amongst most who do it everyday. First of all, there are far more easier paths to creative self-realization, and secondly there are far more important things in the overall grand scheme of life itself. After all, if you lost everyone and everything in your life tomorrow, we&#8217;d bet money that the least important &#8220;treasure&#8221; would be all of the shows you&#8217;ve worked on, right?</p>
<p>Some are motivated by the joy of &#8220;making stuff&#8221;, and music just happens to be the conduit by which they are able to do so. Others might be motivated by the fact that they are able to support their family doing such a thing as working in film music, while even others might be driven by the mere fact that they don&#8217;t know how to do anything else! Then again, maybe you just like to&#8230;oh, I don&#8217;t know&#8230; EAT.</p>
<p>There are hundreds, if not millions, of potentially motivating factors involved in choosing a career in film music. And so, we ask YOU: What <em>TRULY</em> motivates you to continue on in this tough business? Yeah, yeah, yeah&#8230; we get it—<em>you were &#8220;made to do this!&#8221;</em> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But what is it that <em>REALLY</em> keeps you coming back time and time again to have another go, frame after frame, note after note, film after film?</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../2010/08/deane-ogden-caveats-of-convenient-film-composing-pt-1.html" target="_blank">Caveats of Convenience: Part I</a></li>
</ul>
<p>[/slidingnote]</p>
<p>While we often love to talk about what we do right most of the time, these few posts speak instead to some things that I’ve observed film composers doing <em>wrong</em> lately. Of course, that statement in and of itself is highly subjective, but I think there are some habits that are starting to trend that, while possibly not evident right away, will prove down the line to be detrimental to doing business as a film composer in our continually evolving market. I see this list of choices as “temptations of convenience”, and this series might also be called “The Seduction of the Easy Way Out”. In this economy and composing climate, I see a lot of composers taking these routes and while none of them are necessarily “bad”, I’ll try to make the case as to why I believe most of them should be avoided.</p>
<h3>Caveat #2: Fame</h3>
<p>I was at my manager&#8217;s birthday party a few weeks ago and was asked by someone who read my first installment in this series, &#8220;Why did you say, <em>&#8216;You&#8217;ll never become famous being a film composer?&#8217; </em>That&#8217;s not true. There are several people who have become famous composing for films.” This person went on to cite several people who we might all agree could be considered famous in our field: John WIlliams, Jerry Goldsmith, James Horner, and more recently—Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard.</p>
<p>While I would agree that each of those people—and more—are quite famous within the circles of film music, I would not be too quick to say that they are famous as we would define fame within our society&#8217;s immediate cultural definition of the term. For example, ask a person &#8220;Who is Michael Jackson?&#8221; and nine times out of ten you&#8217;ll hear, &#8220;He was the King of Pop.&#8221; Ask the same ten people &#8220;Who is John Williams?&#8221; and I&#8217;m not sure nine of them—or even <em>five</em> of them—would have any answer at the ready. A few may know, while others may only know if you hum a few bars of the &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; theme or the &#8220;Raiders March&#8221;, but the majority would have no clue. This is not to say that Williams isn&#8217;t every bit as influential on the modern landscape of American music. He most certainly has been. But with all due respect to &#8220;the Maestro&#8221;, the truth is that Michael Jackson and John Williams are worlds apart in the &#8220;fame&#8221; department.</p>
<p>In fact, the more I think about this question posed to me by this gentleman at the party, the more I stand behind my statement. First and foremost, “fame”, as defined by Webster&#8217;s, is “the state or quality of being widely honored and acclaimed.” I think we can all agree that by this definition, we as film composers—should we ever attain any great heights of fame and fortune—would be in the minority on this one. Michael Jackson; Michael Jordan; Michael Douglas… hell, Michael LOHAN (ugh!)—I hate to burst any bubbles, but film composers don&#8217;t even register as a blip on the radar screen of <em>that</em> kind of fame.</p>
<p>Secondly, I believe that if the impetus behind your drive to score films is <em>fame</em>, you are missing the point entirely. Maybe I should have said, &#8220;If you <em>want</em> to be famous, don&#8217;t be a composer.&#8221; Maybe that would have made the difference for my friend? I don&#8217;t know. What I <em>do</em> know is that although John Williams ended up being famous doing what he did, I&#8217;d bet money he never intended to write music for the purpose of “getting famous&#8221;. And <em>that’s</em> where I hope people are not headed as they choose to embark on their odyssey in film music. Like anything you put your hand to in life, you have to do it for the love of it, or you are doing it in vain. Period.</p>
<p><strong>The Difference Between <em>Fame </em>and <em>Greatness</em></strong><br />
I&#8217;ve made it a priority in my career to mentor a certain number of film music students during each cycle of work here at the Musicave. One recent student kept using the word &#8220;famous&#8221; every time we would talk about his career goals in our times together. I once asked him at what level a composer would need to be at in order to be free to pick and choose projects as they saw fit. &#8220;After you are <em>famous</em>,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;then you can do whatever you want. Until you get <em>famous</em>, you have to take anything you can get to build your career.&#8221; His choice to constantly use that word&#8230; &#8220;famous&#8221;&#8230; it grated on me like fingernails on a chalkboard. I finally confronted him about it. Susie and I took him to dinner and I told him, &#8220;Dude, we need to talk about something you have been saying that&#8217;s been nagging at me for a few days. This &#8216;getting famous&#8217; thing of yours&#8230; first of all, you are dreaming. That&#8217;s Number 1. Number 2, it&#8217;s just the wrong motivation for wanting to be in film music. No director gives a damn about your desire to &#8216;be famous&#8217;&#8230; they want to know if you love the story enough to give it your all&#8230; FOR THE FILM. It&#8217;s never about YOU. It&#8217;s always about the project.&#8221;</p>
<p>As we talked, the real problem came out. This poor kid has been told all his life that he&#8217;ll &#8220;never do anything <em>great</em>&#8220;. He&#8217;s been put down, stomped on, made to feel inferior, and basically just had every ounce of esteem kicked out of him by the very people who should have been supporting him the most. It became clear to me that this young man equated &#8220;fame&#8221; with &#8220;greatness&#8221;. In his mind, the best way to show those unbelieving people in his life that he was worth believing in was to become &#8220;famous&#8221; doing what they told him he could never and would never do <em>well</em>. Once I helped him identify the real problem, we were then able to have an important conversation about the vast difference between being <em>great</em> and being <em>famous</em>. For him, the delineation of those two ideas was a paradigm shift that he really needed to have if he was to ever stand a chance at this career. Maybe even at life in general.</p>
<p>The sad truth is that many of our graduating film music students are just like this young man once was. They do not understand the difference between <em>being great</em> and <em>being famous</em>. And how could they? Our culture glorifies <em>fame</em>, but places very little value on <em>greatness</em>. They&#8217;ve confused the two, thus sending young people on a wild goose chase to find this brass ring of &#8220;fame&#8221;. Think about this: How many people in your life were extremely popular (famous) but just really not that great of a person? See what I mean? It is a pathetic trend in our society that needs to seriously level off should we hope to extend any nobility to the next generation of film music innovators, or our children in general. There is an entire legion of aspiring composers entering the fold who simply want to be famous or make lots of money. There really are. If you don&#8217;t believe me, spend some time on the campus at some of our finer music schools. I have, and I&#8217;ve seen it with my own eyes and heard with my own ears. Ambition, to these misguided young minds, is simply a commodity to be bought and sold like stocks or widgets. It is something attainable by having as many Twitter followers as Justin Beiber or by having 30 or 40 comments on your Facebook statuses. These kids have seen too many episodes of &#8220;Entourage&#8221;—they&#8217;ve convinced themselves that the way to the top of the film music heap is by becoming the compositional version of &#8220;Vinnie Chase&#8221;. All they need is their &#8220;Ari&#8221; to help them get there.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fame</em> is not Enough</strong><br />
I wish I could stand in front of every film music student enrolled today and tell them that the desire for fame is not a valid reason for doing ANYTHING. To truly get all you can get out of something—in our case, film music—you must simply be in love with the mere act of doing it. Nothing more. I&#8217;m not even talking &#8220;results&#8221;, yet&#8230; I&#8217;m just talking about the <em>action</em> of it. It&#8217;s the <em>action</em> that must consume you. Writing film music must be critical to your very existence. You should love it so much that you go to sleep thinking about how you really should get up and do more of it, and you should be waking up in the morning already late to get back to doing it. The very process must be your only motivation, your every reason, and your insatiable drive for needing to do it some more. It has to be that one thing that you do, that were you ever not able to do it anymore, you would honestly cease to be complete in some unexplainable way—a vital component to your human contentment would be absent&#8230; and that vast expanse would not be a void that could be filled with dollars, fame, notoriety, or accolades. It would be a &#8220;music-shaped hole&#8221; that only writing music could fill again.</p>
<p>Fame doesn&#8217;t do any of that. Fame is a state of <em>being</em>, not a state of <em>process </em>or<em> an action</em>. Fame is not a <em>choice</em>. Fame is something that happens <em>to</em> you, not something you<em> make</em> happen. <em>Fame</em> relies on luck and chance, while <em>greatness</em> relies on consistency of character. Serenity, contentment, balance, and harmony—these are the motivating mechanisms that propel people toward <em>greatness</em>. In this light then, <em>fame</em>, it seems, is simply not enough.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>&#8220;How much money will I make as a film composer?&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the six million dollar question, isn&#8217;t it? I get this question from aspiring composers more than any other, and I never know what to say. As much as I try to come up with a cool, suave answer to their query, all I can usually muster is something like &#8220;Whatever you can!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lame and disappointing? Yes. Honest and truthful? Absolutely.</p>
<p>The bigger question — and the one I want to tackle here — is &#8220;How much money do live players eat up during a film score&#8217;s production and how do you plan for the bloodshed?&#8221; The answer to that questions is&#8230; &#8220;I wish there was an answer.&#8221; The fact is that it really depends on a load of different variables, but I&#8217;ll try to define some of them here for you to help get you thinking about how you should budget your up-fronts to &#8220;pay&#8221; for your score.</p>
<p>But first, let&#8217;s start with some customary &#8220;assumptions&#8221;:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m assuming that:</p>
<p><strong>1) You prefer quality.</strong> I&#8217;m not a believer in skimping or cutting corners. Every score I have ever written has contained live elements of some sort. Whether I was able to hire Richie Sambora to play guitar for me on a TV show or if I record timpani in my studio on my own, the fact is that I made a deal with myself early on that I would go live whenever I possibly could. A live performance, even if it isn&#8217;t the best live performance, still does miracles for a recorded score that samples simply cannot achieve. I would be willing to pay for union musicians to come in and perform on my work for a couple of reasons. First, LA players are simply the best in the world. They make everything sound better. I like having my toes in the player pool around LA because then when I get to hire a full ensemble, pending availability, I&#8217;m more likely to get who I want because of our relationship and work history together.</p>
<p><strong>2) Your score will accommodate live players.</strong> If the score to your project calls for a band consisting of piano, synth pads, mouth percussion, and Indonesian finger cymbals (I once scored a short film with this line-up, believe it or not!), then you are probably not going to need any live players. Piano samples are good enough nowadays that you can get away with Synthogy Ivory or NI Akoustik Piano or something. Anything to keep from spending that $500 to get the ol&#8217; Blüthner tuned up, right? It is really the scores that require orchestral instrumentation of some sort that we are referring to here.</p>
<p><strong>3) You have <em>some</em> budget. </strong>You cannot start with zero. I mean, <em>technically</em> you can, but it&#8217;s not going to be fun for you. To make money, you need to spend some money. Your score will not sound very good if you have no money to put into it. I say this for two reasons, the first one being somewhat obvious, and the second&#8230; not so much. First, no money into a score means that the score will be all sampled (Refer to point number 1 above!). Secondly, no money into a score means no money out of a score for you, and how much do you think *that* scenario is going to motivate you to do your best work? The principals withholding budget from their composer is both a sign of bad planning on their part as well as an assumption of lesser value on your product and its ability to service their film. Not a good combo. Try and get your director or producer to find you some money. Anything. Anything that will give you some kind of reward for scoring this thing. If they can pay you in widgets, then take the widgets and sell them for some money to hire live players.</p>
<p><strong>The Package Deal</strong><br />
Back in the good old days, composers were given a creative fee to write the score and then the studio paid for the rest of the expenses. Studios had musicians on staff that were just there all day and if you needed them, you ran out to the stage and recorded something really quick. If not, they all just sat there all day hoping you came out to visit. Obviously, this became very silly very quickly, and with emerging technology and the composer&#8217;s ability to synthesize a majority of the score at home, &#8220;the package deal&#8221; became popular.</p>
<p>A<em> package deal</em> is when the production gives you a set amount of money from the overall budget and you are then responsible to hire all of the people necessary to bring the score in on-time and on budget, while hopefully maintaining a decent creative fee out of whatever is left after everything is paid for. As you can imagine, it can be tough, if not impossible, to keep any of this money, depending on what the producers &#8220;say&#8221; they want out of the score. If they give you 12k as your music budget, and they want &#8220;live orchestra&#8221;, good luck. You might be able to augment your samples with a smattering of live players, but there will not be anything left after you are done to feed your family with. You either need to negotiate a higher package, have something else going on while you score that film that will supplement your income, or leave the deal on the table and walk away. Those are you options.</p>
<p><strong>The Music Budget </strong><br />
So, let&#8217;s assume that you have some money to play with and that you are excited to get started scoring this new film that you&#8217;ve just been assigned.  Let&#8217;s also say that this film is at the very bottom of what most independent (and by &#8220;independent&#8221;, I mean truly <em>independent</em> &#8230; of a studio, that is) films are budgeting for music these days: $34,000. That is actually where you should be if you are hired onto a low-end indie feature. In fact, if you get *this* much, pat yourself on the back. You are lucky. It should be higher, but it rarely is.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not used to working with a budget of this magnitude before, it looks like a ton of dough at first glance. But in this gig, things add up and it starts to get complicated quickly. Ready to see where it all goes, and how fast? Grab your tissue box&#8230; Let&#8217;s do this!</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Picture+6.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-854" title="Picture+6" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Picture+6-300x188.png" alt="" width="300" height="188" /></a>In a typical &#8220;package deal&#8221; scoring agreement, the composer would get paid in thirds — one-third of the total budget upon attachment to the project, one-third upon commencement of scoring, and the final third upon delivery. This will work fine with our budget since by the time we are ready to record any orchestra, we&#8217;ll already have been paid twice, to the tune of $17k. If we stay disciplined and stick to our Hard Expenses budget of $15,900, we&#8217;ll have $1,100 left over to apply to the rest of our expenses later on. Then if we come in at least under budget with our Soft Expenses, we&#8217;ll make a nice little $14,955 when all is said and done. Additionally, if we can somehow trim a bit out of our Soft Expenses, then we can probably get that number up to around $16k. That&#8217;s not a horrible profit on a film that budgeted 34k to begin with. It&#8217;s not a ton of dough, but for an entry level indie flick, it&#8217;s a nice shot in the arm to start out your career.</p>
<p><strong>Hard Expenses</strong><br />
For the sake of our discussion here, I&#8217;m going to refer to the things that are absolutely non-negotiable — in other words, &#8220;you NEED them&#8221; — as hard expenses. These would be expenses such as musicians, a place to record them (scoring stage or recording studio), an engineer to run those sessions for you, a contractor to get you the players, etc. If you are in a time crunch and/or you cannot do it all yourself, you can also toss an orchestrator into the mix along with an assistant to help you carve audio stems when you get down to delivery time and things start to get tense.</p>
<p><em>Musicians </em><br />
Using the example of some of the films I&#8217;ve scored with budgets like these, I&#8217;m going to say that a 20-piece union string section is going to run you about 10k for a single three hour session. These figures change any time the union renegotiates its contract with producers, so you&#8217;ll always want to call the union <em>before</em> you start your budget to get the most accurate numbers&#8230; but for now, you can see from our mock budget that the orchestra will be our biggest expense, and for good reason. We are not going to skimp on our players. These players are the saving grace of your sound and they are going to basically dress up a lot of what would otherwise be lacking because of our small budget. I&#8217;ve used players on short film budgets that were a fraction of what this one is, and the scores sound like something out of a major studio tent-pole film, so&#8230; our musicians get top dollar. No arguments.</p>
<p>Now, you *can* get a better rate if you were to consider recording in another part of the world like eastern Europe or even Russia, but I would use the word <em>&#8220;better&#8221;</em> very carefully here. &#8220;Better&#8221; doesn&#8217;t necessarily always mean &#8220;better sounding&#8221;. I&#8217;ve recorded in places where you are wise to schedule all of the tough cues toward the start of the day or you run the risk of musicians heading to the pub at lunch and coming back tipsy. Not a great deal for your afternoon sessions! You also have to account for the fact that if you are recording here in town, you are getting up everyday from your place across town and maybe driving 30 minutes to record. Translation: No Overhead. If you are oversees, you have to pay hotel expenses, airfare (roundtrip to Bratislava is running around $1,300 right now), food, and customary travel expenses. That being said, it pays to research the crap out of your &#8220;oversees&#8221; session possibilities before you take the leap. People don&#8217;t realize it, but over the last ten years or so the American Federation of Musicians (or &#8220;AFM&#8221;, the musicians&#8217; union) has made it as easy as ever to record an orchestra in LA or New York, having created a new fee schedule that will accommodate virtually any film production no matter how big or small the music budget. They even have a &#8220;demo scale&#8221; which is just what it sounds like: a reduced scale for those times that you&#8217;d like to have a live orchestra on your&#8230; wait for it&#8230; DEMO. Wouldn&#8217;t *that* be kick ass?</p>
<p>For a group of more than 35 players, union rates are currently hovering around $262 per player/per session. If you require fewer players, the rates go up from there. Don&#8217;t forget that you&#8217;ll need to pay your contractor (also known sometimes as an &#8220;orchestra manager&#8221;), which is the person that puts your orchestra together for you. They make double scale, which is simply twice the standard musicians&#8217; rate of pay. So in our case, since we are using only 20 players, our player rate will be about $300 per player/session. Then, you add the contractor to that at double scale, which is $600, bringing you to a total player cost of $6,600. Sweet! We budgeted 10k for players, so this means we are already way under budget, right? Well&#8230; not so fast.</p>
<p><em>Doubling </em><br />
You are having one of your violinists and one of your cellists play solos on two of your cues. You are also asking one of your players to &#8220;double&#8221; on another instrument. <em>Doubling</em> usually applies mainly to woodwind or brass players (a flutist also playing piccolo, or a trumpet player also playing flugelhorn). Piano players aren&#8217;t considered doublists if you also need them on celesta. Whatever the case, musicians aren&#8217;t going to double for free. For these special skills, they receive additional pay.</p>
<p><em>Cartage</em><br />
We also have two (2) double basses in our line-up. That means that we also will be taking care of their cartage fees. &#8220;Cartage&#8221; is the cost of getting a larger, less manageable instrument to and from the recording venue. Cartage fees always apply to double bass, tuba, cello, percussion (tympani, bass drum, vibes, tubular chimes, etc.), baritone sax, bass sax, contra-bass clarinet, contra bassoon, accordion, baritone horn, and contra bass trombone. AFM says that cartage on one single double bass is about $12 per session, but in LA, cartage fees are often billed at a higher rate than AFM projections, so we&#8217;ll add in $200 for today&#8217;s bassists. I&#8217;m not a union percussionist, but as a drummer I&#8217;m well aware of the costs of shipping gear. It&#8217;s not easy, and the employer is almost always responsible for it&#8230; most certainly so when it is a union gig.</p>
<p>As you can see, it starts adding up fast, and when all is said and done, we are looking at about $10,000 to get everybody paid and taken care of for a standard 3-hour session. You also need to take into account that this number is ONLY for a single 3-hour session. At 45 minutes of recording time per hour (AFM regulations give musicians a 15-minute break every hour), you are only talking about 15 minutes or so of finished music if you record at a rate of 5 minutes per hour (fairly standard for an LA orchestra). In a hybrid-score situation, this might be just what you need. If your score is wholly orchestral, however, you&#8217;ll obviously need a lot more time. Translation: You&#8217;re gonna need more money.</p>
<p>There are so many factors that go into accounting your budget for players. How much music do you need to record? How many players will record it? Are there any doubles? Are there any soloists? Does the *whole* band need to be there for all of the sessions, or can you record with everyone for the bigger cues and then start cutting players as you scale down the score to the more intimate cues? How much cartage is involved? Be smart. Use the schedule to your advantage. Don&#8217;t be stupid about what you can and cannot get away with using samples — if you can record it, then record it! Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask questions&#8230; there aren&#8217;t any dumb questions, and if there are&#8230; JUST BE WILLING TO LOOK DUMB! Who gives a crap! You won&#8217;t give one either after you are hit with your first meal penalty because you didn&#8217;t ask questions! Use your people&#8230; your concertmaster, your union rep. Talk to your players&#8230; go out on the floor and shake hands with them. Be genuine and thank them for playing and being who they are. Use your contractor&#8230; your contractor can either be your best friend or your worst nightmare. They are there to help you, but ultimately, their job is to protect those union musicians. They have the power to shut down your session if you are abusing musicians by not following the rules.</p>
<p>The bottom line with players is this: Everybody is working for the good of the product. You call the shots, but you have to follow the rules and treat people as they deserve to be treated. Do it right, and live session players will make your little 34k score sound like a 100k score. I&#8217;m not lying.</p>
<p><em>Recording Venue </em><br />
The next expenditure that we&#8217;ll need to shell out some good money for is the venue in which we&#8217;ll record the score. Under normal circumstances (read: a larger budget), we would contact a stage here in town like Warners, Fox, or Sony (Eastwood Scoring Stage, Newman Scoring Stage, or the Barbara Streisand Scoring Stage, respectively) to record our full-sized orchestra. But since we are working with a smaller group this time out — 20 string players, to be exact — we&#8217;ll save some money here and record in one of the many excellent recording studios here in Los Angeles that are known for getting a solid sound with a smaller ensemble. Rooms like Westlake Audio&#8217;s Studio &#8220;D&#8221;, Capitol &#8220;A&#8221;, Henson&#8217;s big room, or Glenwood Place in Burbank are all perfect for this size of group, and they are also all known for getting a great string sound. For three-hour sessions, you can expect to pay between $800 on the low end to approximately $1,500 or even $2,000 on the high end for one of these rooms. Scoring stages are considerably more, but again, you won&#8217;t need one unless you are scoring a studio feature with a large music budget which will require a 50+ piece orchestra. If you are, then that discussion is beyond the scope of this article. We&#8217;ll save that one for next time!</p>
<p>We are going to go with a place that quoted $1,200 for a 3-hour session. With that fee of $1,200, you&#8217;ll get a lot of stuff. First, and most obviously, the room—complete with all of the booth gear, the big recording console, and the lounge facilities of the studio. The studio&#8217;s piano is going to cost extra, but since we are using the Ivory plug-in, we won&#8217;t be needing that, so money saved there. For our rental of the studio, we also get use of all of the studio&#8217;s microphones, although your engineer will most likely bring their own tried and tested set-up. Just let them, believe me. They know what they are doing.</p>
<p><em>The Engineer </em><br />
Speaking of which, almost always you&#8217;ll want to differ to your engineer as to which room you should use in the first place. Nobody knows the attributes and nuances of stages and rooms better than your recording engineer. In fact, that is part of the reputation of a great recordist: Their ears are tuned to the point that they understand and are aware of the places to get the best recordings, given the specifics of your project.</p>
<p>The engineer might be the single most important piece of the puzzle to getting a great film score sound, so bargain-shopping for one is not something I would recommend doing. Expect to pay between $800 to $2000 per three-hour session for a great engineer. This might seem like a lot of money, but I assure you, they earn every penny. You won&#8217;t know this until your first time out with a good engineer, but they are working far beyond that three hours of recording time. They arrive to your session hours ahead of even you (sometimes even the day before) to set-up microphones and place music stands and seats, insuring that you have plenty of separation between instrument groups. Many times, the engineer will work with an assistant (usually the salaried assistant at the studio you are recording at), and will put this person to work running cable and positioning microphone stands. The fee for the engineering assistant is often included in the studio rental fee. If it isn&#8217;t, ask if the studio is willing to roll the assistant&#8217;s fee into the cost of the rental. Most places will.</p>
<p>One last thing about engineers: When you find a great engineer that you work well with, stick with them. Bring them with you on all of your jobs. Repeated work with that person will lead to the two of you being able to finish each others&#8217; musical sentences, and that is a luxury when things are tense in the control booth that you&#8217;ll appreciate down the road. For years, Tom Geron was my engineer. Lately, as Tom has taken on more and more work as an engineer for pop radio studio sessions, I&#8217;ve used other engineers, like Michael Arvold. On my orchestral sessions for &#8220;The Way Home&#8221;, we had a ProTools melt-down that seemed at first to be pretty monumental. As I sat there hyper-ventilating, Michael was able to fix the problem in a few minutes, saving us from wasting precious time and money with all the musicians staring at us through the glass. These are the times when history with a solid engineer is priceless.</p>
<p><em>Orchestrator</em><br />
I&#8217;ll be brief with this one, and I&#8217;ll abstain from starting a flame war as to whether or not orchestrators are important to the process. For the purposes of our example here, I budgeted one in at $900. Orchestrators typically work on a &#8220;page rate&#8221; — a certain amount of dollars for one page of orchestrated score. A common misconception among newer composers is that orchestrators and copyists are one-in-the-same. They are not. An orchestrator *can* also copy if that is the arrangement, but they are not automatically expected to do so. Copying is normally considered a separate line item from orchestration.</p>
<p>Most composers are used to paying orchestrators ±$90 per page of finished score. This is a general guideline, however, as I&#8217;ve paid less than that and more at times, depending on who the orchestrator was and what the demand was for that orchestrator&#8217;s particular brand of orchestration. You can see how this will add up when you consider that a page of score is typically four measures long for a full group of players. However, for our little 20-piece string section, we can probably have the orchestrator get most of it on two or three pages for each instrument group. This however, has little or no bearing on how much they will charge. Just because they can squeeze everything on one page doesn&#8217;t mean their page rate now goes down (another common misconception). Communication here is key, so be clear and get all of the facts when you hire your orchestrator. They will save your ass in most cases, so paying them what they are worth is something that you just need to be damned happy about.</p>
<p><em>Conductor</em><br />
I&#8217;m going to assume, since this is a little string date, that you are going to conduct your string players yourself. You may choose not to do this, either because your director will be there and you are nervous leaving them alone in the booth, or because you simply aren&#8217;t an experienced conductor. Either is fine and you shouldn&#8217;t be ashamed of those reasons for staying in the booth and hiring this role out to someone who can handle it for you. On the other hand, I heartily recommend you conducting your scores at least every once in a while. It is good practice, and it also just makes for a different kind of session. There is nothing quite like conducting players to a piece of music you have written. Often, you can evoke more emotion out of a group that you are conducting yourself, simply because the players see and feel your emotion behind your own music.</p>
<p>Many orchestrators also conduct. SCOREcast&#8217;s Brian Satterwhite recently orchestrated on a score that I wrote. As our recording dates approached, it became clear that I needed Brian to also conduct so that I could stay focused on the sound of the score with my director and manage the sessions from within the booth.</p>
<p><strong>Soft Expenses </strong><br />
Our &#8220;soft expenses&#8221; are going to be things that would be great to have, but are not absolutely necessary. I usually try and include these things when I budget out a job, but that&#8217;s just me. You can do what you want&#8230; I&#8217;ve just found that putting these things in the budget allows me to keep everything related to the project in my business accounting and separate from my personal accounting. With this method, I keep the little things that add up over time from going on a personal credit card for convenience sake. It&#8217;s not so convenient on April 15th when my accountant shows me that I accidentally paid for my team&#8217;s plane tickets to the premiere in San Francisco with my personal Visa card!<br />
<em></em></p>
<p><em>Studio Upgrades</em><br />
I&#8217;ve included this here to illustrate a point more than anything: If I had a nickel for all of the times I&#8217;ve been told by an aspiring composer, &#8220;As soon as I get my first payment from them, I&#8217;m going to upgrade my studio so I&#8217;m ready to roll!&#8221;&#8230; well&#8230; I&#8217;d be a very rich man. &#8220;Getting your first gig&#8221; is NOT the time to make sure you are technologically ready to start scoring films. You need to have that all ironed out ahead of time. Here&#8217;s why: If you are prepared for this gig, and you have done your homework early instead of waiting until you have the gig to do it, this entire category of expenses becomes pure profit. Said another way&#8230; That&#8217;s cold hard cash straight into your bank account! It&#8217;s a harsh awakening to start out a project having to hand over a major portion of your potential profits to a place like Guitar Center. Blech! That&#8217;s a soul-sucking event if there ever was one! Tackle the due diligence of getting your rig up to snuff before you sign a project. Trust me&#8230; you&#8217;d rather hit the ground running with a rig that works than have your head in manuals for the first two weeks of your scoring schedule.</p>
<p><em>Filmmaker Meetings/Meals/Gas/Auto</em><br />
I know what you are thinking&#8230; &#8220;Deane&#8230; seriously? Really?&#8221;. Yes. I. Do. I ABSOLUTELY figure in my meetings at Starbucks or dinner with my clients, as well as the automotive expenses to make them all happen. Why not? If not for those meetings, I would be totally satisfied to eat at home with my family like any other night of my life. This is a necessary expense that I incur in order to take care of my clients, so yes&#8230; I take it out of the budget.</p>
<p><em>Studio Lease/Power/Materials</em><br />
These three things are expenditures that I will incur to keep the lights on in my studio while I work on this project. All three come right out of the budget. Some of the best advice I have ever heard was from my high school economics teacher, Ron Sather. He said, &#8220;Your family budget should never absorb any of your business budget liabilities.&#8221; If you have your studio in your home, I hope to all that&#8217;s holy that you are taking a tax deduction on the square footage of your studio space. The IRS allows for that and you should be taking advantage. Additionally, do not put your power, space, and materials expenses (CD cases, printer paper, pens/pencils, ink, USB cables, etc.) on the shoulders of your family or personal budget. Everything should be kept separate so that at tax time you are able to get the maximum deduction, saving you boatloads of dough.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaways</strong><br />
I hope this has been helpful. I know it is sort of hard to envision a fake budget when there really is no hard data to go on, but I&#8217;m sure you get my point. If there is anything that I think is an important takeaway from what I&#8217;ve presented here, it&#8217;s this: The reward of scoring films is mostly an emotional/spiritual/psychological one. Sometimes, there is not much money in the craft and if you really boil down the expenses, it can be a bit disconcerting. But remember: Even the top 12 guys that are scoring 80% of the tent-pole studio features in Hollywood right now&#8230; when you add up their expenditures and their work hours, their ROI is not what you might think it is. Jerry Goldsmith once said, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t like it for the love of it, you&#8217;ll hate it for the hurt of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>If it is true that financial pressure is the #1 cause of broken families in America, you can only imagine what it can do to you as a businessperson. Get yourself together and do some hardcore, pencil-sharpening work on your budget outlines for your projects before you turn them in. It is so worth all of the footwork, and this gig will be a hell of a lot more profitable for you if you do.</p>
<p><strong>What Do You Think?</strong><br />
I realize that I left out a TON of information in this article, and honestly, this topic is ginormous—I could talk about it with you for three days and we still wouldn&#8217;t cover it all. I&#8217;m committed to being on the COMMENTS this week like never before to answer any questions anyone might have about budgets&#8230; and here is my pledge: NOTHING IS OFF LIMITS. Ask away. If I can&#8217;t give you an answer, I&#8217;ll find someone who can. Let&#8217;s talk about this budgeting thing and see if we can&#8217;t wrap our heads around it a little bit more together!﻿</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/06/sig-fenoughty.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-780" title="sig-fenoughty" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/06/sig-fenoughty.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>The month of June has been one of reflection, for me, on the first half of the year, consolidation, evaluation, and looking forward to what the rest of the year will hold. It&#8217;s the calm between storms, if you will. One of the things I&#8217;ve been mulling over and considering is business development and branding. After all, my freelance work is a business, and it deserves the same care and attention as any business to grow and become more profitable.</p>
<p>Through this process, I&#8217;ve become fascinated with the  &#8216;Myers-Briggs&#8217; test. There are loads of different kinds of personality tests out there, but this is the one I&#8217;ve found the most useful and accurate for how I approach life and, more importantly, the business of scoring picture.</p>
<p>In the most basic sense, it describes you as the kind of person who gets their kicks from jamming with other people, or from kicking your brain into high gear on your own to solve problems; if you live in the &#8216;now&#8217; or if you&#8217;re constantly plotting for the future; if you&#8217;re details- or big-picture-oriented; and if you&#8217;re ruled by your heart or your head.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s more interesting is how the different bits of your personality come together to create something greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes2.asp">The test is here</a>. (There are others out there. Google it if you want to try it a few times. If you&#8217;re that way inclined… that probably means you&#8217;re an xSTx)</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve got your type, go <a href="http://www.personalitypage.com/html/portraits.html">here</a> to get a summary of your traits, and let us know in the comments if you feel it&#8217;s an accurate portrayal of yourself…</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an INTJ &#8211; also called a mastermind! I&#8217;ll plot and plan and scheme until a solution to any problem is reached, or any system I&#8217;ve created is the most efficient and fit for purpose it can be. And woe betide anyone who crosses paths with me and doesn&#8217;t live up to these high standards of efficiency and reliability. I&#8217;m focussed on the details, the intricacies. This counts for both music and life. I know where I want to go and can tell you exactly how I&#8217;m gonna get there… and if I don&#8217;t, give me a little while to mull it over, and I&#8217;ll come back with a point-by-point plan. Colour-coded. With graphs and projections (if there&#8217;s time and it&#8217;s the most efficient way of conveying the information, of course).</p>
<p>So all this self-analysis is very interesting (unless your an ESFJ, in which case it may not be your cup of tea) but it&#8217;s all a little on the self-indulgent side if there&#8217;s no real-world application for it.</p>
<p>As with all these personality typing tests, there&#8217;s an accompanying list of &#8216;ideal&#8217; jobs per type. Take this with a pinch of salt (unless you&#8217;re an xSFP), and instead see how your natural strengths can compliment your chosen line of work… and how your less-than-useful traits can be &#8216;hacked&#8217; or worked around.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll use myself as an example, and forgive me for hogging the limelight. (As an INxx, you now know how much I dislike this <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> )</p>
<p>I&#8217;m detailed, organised, efficient, reliable, solutions-oriented = working with me is easy as I&#8217;ll always deliver on time to the utmost of my abilities, cover all possible contingencies, and not waste budget on pointless extra bells and whistles that you don&#8217;t need.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m introverted = O-oh. You&#8217;d think this was a weakness in our business of &#8216;it&#8217;s-who-you-know-not-what-you-know&#8217;. Walking into a crowded room of people I&#8217;ve never met with the express purpose of networking is not my idea of fun. I would imagine there are a few readers who are with me on that. But I&#8217;ve developed &#8216;hacks&#8217;. I like to get to the nitty-gritty of a person, to understand them, when chatting one-on-one. Small talk is neither one of my strengths nor useful to me in forming relationships with people, but I do like to know what makes them tick &#8211; what are their values, their long term goals in life, do they like sci-fi (this is actually the litmus test for getting on with me <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ).</p>
<p>So I <em>don&#8217;t</em> work the room. I can&#8217;t, I&#8217;m not made that way. Why fight it &#8211; it&#8217;s not the most efficient way to proceed.</p>
<p>So, at a networking event, there is no time limit on my discussions with you. I won&#8217;t sell myself to you, but instead I&#8217;ll find connections for you with the people I know… because that&#8217;s the most efficient way of making that room of people, that potential <em>system</em>, work… and in the end, that&#8217;s the best way for me to find business opportunities &#8211; seeking out teams of people that collaborate so well together that they effortlessly create fabulous films or projects that are a delight to score. That&#8217;s the theory anyway, and it seems to be going ok in practise so far…</p>
<p>One of the strangest things I discovered in doing this is that I&#8217;m a T (Thinker), not an F (Feeler). Life and business is run by my frontal lobe (head), not my endocrine system (heart). Whilst this is awesomely useful from a business-entrepreneurial point of view, I&#8217;ve chosen the <em>business of emotion</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a music composer, a crystalliser of feeling, a reality-maker of emotion. Conflict of interests, n&#8217;est-ce pas?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still working this out to be honest. I can reduce most of the emotional quality of a piece of score to it&#8217;s rational, practical music theory. Is it this process of analysis that allows me to synthesise a score back into that emotion at the required time for picture? Is it my dispassionate nature that allows objectivity, a &#8216;thick skin&#8217;, when it comes to criticism of my work from my clients and collaborators? Is it that I see all my work as a business so that I&#8217;m actually ok selling my creations and don&#8217;t really mind that much if an editor trims and loops it here and there to fit with a new picture cut?</p>
<p>All I know is that when a piece of music moves me, there must be something seriously useful to learn from it, since it got through all those layers of logic and reason!  Which immediately prompts analysis and filing away in the &#8216;locus of cool&#8217;. With colour coding.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes2.asp">Here&#8217;s the link</a> to the test again.</p>
<p>Let us know your type in the comments! (If not for yourselves, then do it for me. Now you know my obsessive-compulsive need to understand and work you all out.)</p>

		<description><![CDATA[This one single piece of advice will change your life, I promise.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t spend a lot of time online. I&#8217;m sure I should, and I bet there is some self-appointed social networking &#8220;expert&#8221; out there that would scold me for my lack of attention to online marketing. I don&#8217;t have a &#8220;dot com&#8221; and I don&#8217;t (think?) I have a &#8220;brand.&#8221; In fact, I barely have a business card. You should see it—it&#8217;s a simple white card in black Arial Bold that says, &#8220;Jai Meghan : Scoring Assistant&#8221;, with my phone number. Problem is, the phone number is not in service anymore, so underneath the crossed out phone number (in Sharpie, of course!) is my new Gmail address that was only set up a few months ago. By the time I finally remember to log in and check my Facebook messages—and honestly, I&#8217;m not even sure <em>that&#8217;s</em> what Facebook is really for—they are so old that the person has written a follow up that goes something like, &#8220;Dude, are you mad at me or something?&#8221;.</p>
<p>Basically, I suck.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m terrible at promotion. What I am great at, however, is returning calls, responding to emails; all of the things that are required to do business. I can handle those tasks with no problems, but when it comes to these social networking tools that are the rage right now, I&#8217;m the last guy you want advice from.</p>
<p>And so&#8230; I&#8217;ll do the opposite. I&#8217;m going to give you the antidote to all of those things; the secret weapon; the Kryptonite to what everyone else is telling you. I&#8217;m going to tell you what works better than any Tweet, Facebook status update, or MySpace Bulletin will ever work. This one single piece of advice will change your life, I promise.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Shut up and score.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This town—Los Angeles—is full of crap&#8230; and I&#8217;m not talking about content, I&#8217;m talking about people&#8217;s lines of BS. Vigorous self-promotion and self-aggrandizement the likes of nothing I&#8217;ve ever seen. Everyone has a spiel. Everybody has a schtick. I see many composers online talking about this and that on Twitter or Facebook—what they&#8217;ve done, what they are doing—and I think, &#8220;But how is your music?&#8221;</p>
<p>There seems to be two types of people in this particular area of focus: The composers that talk about everything that&#8217;s going on but have nothing <em>actually</em> going on, and the composers who talk about the stuff they <em>actually</em> <em>do</em> have going on. The second group I will &#8220;follow&#8221; or &#8220;friend&#8221;, and the first I absolutely will not.</p>
<p>There is another group of people that I will not be associated with who just gather follows or friends. I cannot tell you how many friend requests I get from people that are just out looking to build up their number of friends on Facebook or their followers on Twitter. If you are one of these people—and it is easy to tell who you are because either we have tons of friends in common but have never met or spoken, or worse yet, we have <em>zero</em> friends in common and have never spoken!—I will decline you without hesitation.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing, and then I&#8217;ll give you SCOREcasters the floor to tell me why I&#8217;m wrong or right&#8230; If you are a great composer, PROVE IT. Let us hear this amazing sound that&#8217;s coming out of your head. You don&#8217;t need to self-promote. Your <em>music</em> should do that talking. Your <em>work</em> should be your promoter. If you feel like you need to self-promote (which, given the fierce competition out there, you very well might), then do it with your work. Post some of your cues every once in a while. Have some guts! Let us hear this amazing music you keep talking about. Risk a little and put yourself out there. Let the world experience the creativity you have pouring forth. I seriously doubt your producers/directors will care. If you think they will, then ask them! I think you&#8217;ll be surprised as to what they say.</p>
<p>Quietly promote yourself, and back it up with evidence. To put it bluntly&#8230; Shut up and score.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Professionalism should be that standard by which we work at all times, no matter the type of project, the size of the budget, or the people for whom we are working. What you do at every step, how you conduct your business and professional life, will determine your career.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sig-avant.jpg"><img src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sig-avant.jpg" alt="" title="sig-avant" width="136" height="136" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-538" /></a>A professional is skilled, proficient, competent and businesslike. Who wouldn’t want to emulate these qualities? </p>
<p>Professionalism should be that standard by which we work at all times, no matter the type of project, the size of the budget, or the people for whom we are working. What you do at every step, how you conduct your business and professional life, will determine your career.</p>
<p>Be a pro at what you do: return calls; be on time for meetings; be respectful of your filmmakers’ accomplishments; be considerate of their time; be knowledgeable, efficient, businesslike, and clear; be the person on the team who gets things done — even if it’s beyond your job description as a composer — and always be prepared for any situation.  Then, create exceptional music. </p>
<p>The business of a film composer can be elusive.   You might be so involved in your own world of creating beautiful music that you forget (or don’t even know) how to be businesslike.  Perhaps musical proficiency holds more importance for you.</p>
<p>Skill and competency in music is important, but that isn’t enough to be successful as a film composer. You can be highly trained in your field but if you don’t know how to deal with people on a professional level and do business, then how will you forward your career?</p>
<p>Here are a few concepts I have acquired by reading articles and books, by talking with business professionals — who are not composers or musicians — and through my own experience.  </p>
<p><strong>The Call</strong><br />
What might seem simple, like returning calls or emails, may be a problem area you need to handle in your business approach.</p>
<p>A quick reply could put you ahead of the other composer who seems too busy and waits a couple of days (or even a week) before answering a call or an email.  It doesn’t have to be that time-consuming to make a call or write a quick email. If your attitude is, “This can wait,” then you may be sending the wrong message.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a lot of time to talk, then preface your call by saying, “I only have a minute or two, but I wanted to return your call.”  They will appreciate your quick action.</p>
<p>Make it a rule to return calls and emails within 24 hours or less, because another composer could be contacted just as easily as you, and they will find the time to make that new connection. </p>
<p><strong>Networking</strong><br />
Networking is critical for a film composer. You have to get out there and meet filmmakers. </p>
<p>Join filmmaker groups and be consistent in attending their events.</p>
<p>Networking is like an advertisement in a newspaper or on television.  People see the ad and usually don’t respond right away, but if they see the ad <em>enough</em>, the name or product becomes more familiar. </p>
<p>Results are not always immediate in advertising or networking. The people you meet may not become your <em>very</em> next project, but after consistent networking and being out there, your name will come up and you will be remembered, then <em>maybe</em> they will call you. </p>
<p>Recently I was at a film event, and I met a new filmmaker who recognized my name and commented, “I’ve heard a lot of good things about you.” That was nice!  I haven’t heard anything since, but it is a good sign to me that my networking is paying off.</p>
<p>If you need to improve your networking skills, there are some great books and articles that can teach you the technique of meeting new people and feeling comfortable in a social surrounding.  Composers are sometimes used to being on their own and not socializing, but you will never meet people in the film business unless you get out there with them and network. </p>
<p>Learn the art of conversation and be determined to lose your inhibition in a social setting.</p>
<p>A Google search on conversational books will lead you in the right direction. </p>
<p><strong>Follow Up</strong><br />
Your networking should provide you with several new business contacts and their cards.<br />
During the networking event, and directly after your conversation with the new filmmaker, write down quick notes that will remind you of what you just discussed with your new contact.  It could be something about their work or a topic that came up in conversation… anything to remind you of them and what you were talking about.  Just write it down. Later, it will be something you can refer to. </p>
<p>Then, <em>follow up</em>.  So many times people don’t follow up with the new contacts they have made, and the opportunity is lost. Business cards do nothing for you unless they are used.  Some people never look at them again and throw them away.  These are potential leads for you, so make good use of them. </p>
<p>I try to follow up with a short email the same day or evening I have met a new filmmaker.</p>
<p>View the filmmaker’s web site; in your email bring up the conversation you had with them or mention something good about their work, and include your contact information and links to your web site in your email signature.</p>
<p>Those are great ways to <em>truly</em> take advantage of business cards. </p>
<p>Continue following up with your new contacts.  Find out what they have for new projects and give them updates of your recent work. </p>
<p>——————</p>
<p>It takes effort to do business as a film composer, and even if you don’t see immediate results, you <em>will</em> eventually.</p>
<p>I look forward to your comments and the ideas you all have on being pro.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sig-brockmann.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-530" title="sig-brockmann" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sig-brockmann.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>There’s an epidemic going on that no one wants to talk about. Lots of people in our business are hurting, and computer work is the main culprit.</p>
<p>One composer I know says every bone and joint in her body hurts all the time. She is saving up for a hydraulic lifter for her keyboard and computer workstation, so she can vary her position, working standing up as well as seated. Another I know has intense shoulder pain, and can’t raise his arm above shoulder level. He doesn’t want his clients to know, because he’s afraid they will think he can’t do the work.</p>
<p>The first person I ever heard of who injured his hands trying to become a better musician was the composer Robert Schumann. In trying to develop increased finger independence at the piano, he famously immobilized his fourth fingers with a length of string and ended up crippling his hands. It’s said that this motivated him to turn to composition.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he wasn’t the last person that ever hurt himself creating music. It’s estimated that as many as a third of symphony and studio musicians will at some point in their career deal with pain or injuries to the hands. It’s very common to deny or conceal these problems, for fear of getting a reputation for being disabled and losing work.</p>
<p>In today’s world the job of composer is not a haven from such injuries. Intensive computer use, combined with the pressures of huge workloads and deadlines, can lead to serious problems if one isn’t careful. Many fail to recognize the problem until it is too late.</p>
<h4>DO I HAVE CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME?</h4>
<p>I recently discussed this situation with Laura Stewart, president of Wellspring Therapy of Glendale. In the 20 years she has been an occupational therapist and certified hand therapist, she has gained a reputation as one of the foremost authorities on treatment and recovery from injuries of the hand. She stresses that the absolute most important thing about dealing with this sort of injury is to prevent it from happening in the first place; we’ll get to that in a moment.</p>
<p>But what if you’re already feeling a twinge, how can you find out more about it? The news media, in simplifying things for mass consumption, have led us to believe that anything that goes wrong with the hands must be carpal tunnel syndrome. But in reality, there are a number of different things that can go wrong with your hands, wrists, arms and shoulders. Most common are carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, and osteoarthritis. Here’s a simple way to tell the difference:</p>
<p><strong>Carpal tunnel syndrome:</strong> Between the bones of your wrist, there are several tiny tunnels through which tendons and nerves must pass. Repetition of a motion with hands or fingers can cause swelling of the tendons that make the fingers move, constricting the nerves that share the carpal tunnel. Symptoms of this include numbness, tingling, pain that resembles a burning feeling in the hands, and eventual weakness of hands and fingers.</p>
<p>If this is your problem, you may feel numbness and tingling on the inside half of your hand, that is the thumb, index, middle, and the inside half of your ring finger. Why? Because the nerves that lead to those figures go through the carpal tunnel. Nerves that go to other parts of the hand go through other tunnels in the wrist.</p>
<p><strong>Tendinitis:</strong> Tendinitis is inflammation of the tendons in the hand, wrist, and forearm that attach muscles to the bones. Symptoms are primarily pain and decrease in movement; this problem seldom causes numbness.</p>
<p><strong>Osteoarthritis:</strong> This form of arthritis (not to be confused with rheumatoid arthritis, which is not included in this discussion) is often associated with aging, but can happen to people of any age. It is caused by the deterioration of the cartilage between the bones, the pad surfaces that cushion their intersections. Of the three types of injury, this type can most easily be diagnosed using X-rays.</p>
<h4>STEERING CLEAR OF DANGER</h4>
<p>Repetitive motion injuries can be serious and very painful, and can even threaten your career. There are ways to avoid these problems, or mitigate them if you’re already having some trouble, but it often can be difficult. It often takes very substantial changes in work habits, physical fitness, and even attitudes towards the work you do — real life changes.</p>
<p>High pressure and tight deadlines aren’t the only reason one can develop this sort of problem. Composers and other creative people are often very highly motivated, even to the point of being obsessive. It’s a rush and a thrill when a good piece of music takes shape, and one can lose track of the hours fine-tuning and tweaking the sounds with the mouse and keyboard. Later you finally come up for air and then, “Ouch!”  The pain and other symptoms are often delayed.</p>
<p>The body wasn’t designed to do the same small repetitive tasks for an extended time, and the equipment isn’t always designed to help the body in the best way. Here are few tips on how to work smart and prevent injuries; they may look familiar, but are worth thinking about again:</p>
<p><strong>Good ergonomics and posture:</strong> You must be able to reach your computer keyboard and mouse without straining. A good keyboard workstation should have a computer keyboard tray that is adjustable in its height and angle. As you sit up straight and reach for the keys, your elbows should not be bent at an angle tighter than 90 degrees. That is, make sure your chair is high enough and your keyboard is low enough that you’re not reaching up to the keyboard or mouse. Try to always hold your wrists straight and even, in a neutral position, never arched nor sunk down nor twisted sideways. Try to relax your shoulders; tension can make them rise up toward your ears. And make sure your screen is high enough that you don’t have to hunch or slump — a good rule of thumb: sit up straight in front of your screen; the top one-fourth of its area should be at about eye level and three-fourths below.</p>
<p>Reality check: What do we do about a workstation that also has a MIDI controller keyboard? For good playing technique the MIDI keys need to be at a proper height as well; a grand piano usually has its key tops at approximately 27- 28 in. Some people are more comfortable with a tray for the computer keyboard that is down low underneath the piano keys, perhaps on a sliding track, and some place the computer keyboard on top of the MIDI keys. It may also work to have the computer keyboard and mouse off to one side. Some trial and error may be necessary. But watch out for extremes — I know one composer who had his Macintosh keyboard down at the very far left-hand end of the 88-key controller, and the track ball to the right at the opposite end. His work position had him splayed out like he was on a cross, a real recipe for back, shoulder, and hand pain. Ow!</p>
<p>It’s also important to get a good adjustable chair that is the right size for you. Make sure it has good lumbar (lower back) support, and if there are armrests they should be adjusted low enough that they don’t make you hunch your shoulders or get in the way when you play music. Even though various wrist pads are popular, most physical therapist strongly advise that you don’t rest your wrists or arms while you type or work the mouse; it’s important that the large muscles of the arms and shoulders are used to support the hands and fingers, and that you have some flexibility to move your body as you work.</p>
<p><strong>Keep fit.</strong> A sedentary lifestyle can lead you to getting hurt much more easily. Think of yourself as a “hand athlete” — if you did that much continual work with your legs, such as running, you would understand the need for good fitness throughout your body. Therapists often recommend cardiovascular exercise and weight training (although if you are already hurting don’t just start lifting weights without guidance!). And, as with any athletic workout, a start with a warm-up and stretches, including your hands, is always wise.</p>
<p><strong>Keep your tools sharp.</strong> Just as it takes many more pounds of force to cut up a chicken with a dull knife than with a sharp one, computer tools that are stiff or worn out can make your work harder than it needs to be. The tiny movements that you do over and over with your hands should be made as easy as possible for them. Little bits add up! I recently sat down at a composer’s workstation and found the track ball to be so rough and stiff that it practically took two hands to move it. A good-quality trackball should glide with only a feather-light touch. Sometimes they need cleaning or lubrication or just replacing. Your fingers will thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Take breaks and break up your tasks.</strong> When we get obsessed, or on a deadline, it’s easy to lose track of time. Taking regular breaks, even if it’s just to get up and stretch and walk around the room for five minutes, is essential. And if you’ve got more than one job on your to-do list, it’s better to do a little bit of one and then a little bit of the next rather than to power through on just one task.</p>
<h4>TOOLS THAT CAN HELP</h4>
<p>There are lots of “ergonomic” keyboards and other accessories out there. Different people get good results from different things. Here are a few accessories that many find useful:</p>
<p><strong>Kensington Turbo Mouse:</strong> This is a large (2&#8243;) trackball. Its broad size helps you keep your hand in more of a flat position, which can help avoid pain. Also, the four or more buttons (depending upon the model) can be programmed to common actions such as click-hold (drag), double-click, etc. (Avoid the wireless model.) Many people find that a traditional mouse can cause stress and tension in their arms and shoulders, due to the fact that a lot of work you do dragging things around on the screen involves holding down the button and so your arm is continually tensed. Instead, you can momentarily click a click-hold button, then lightly roll the ball to make the edit or other drag, and then click again to release. I’m often surprised by people who don’t bother to program the buttons and get accustomed to them — give it a try; once you get the hang of it you will find that it helps a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Kinesis programmable USB foot switch (<a href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/">Kinesis-Ergo.com</a>):</strong> The 3 foot pedals can be programmed to duplicate any button on your mouse or keyboard. If your hands are tired of all the clicking this can help. (It can also come in handy as a “record” foot switch for punching yourself in and out.)</p>
<p><strong>Voice-recognition software:</strong> The best one I have found for Macintosh is Dictate from MacSpeech/Nuance. It’s not perfect but there’s not much else to choose from. (This article was written using it.) If you use a Windows machine, Dragon Naturally-Speaking is said to be quite good. Unfortunately these are only useful for writing tasks such as word-processing and e-mail; they’re not much help in most music software.</p>
<h4>FOR MORE INFORMATION</h4>
<p><strong>The book to get:</strong> This may well be the most important part of this article. If you’re having pain or other problems with your hands, or just want to learn more so that you can avoid such problems, an essential book is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Repetitive- Strain-Injury-Computer- Users/dp/0471595330/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1274545599&amp;sr=8-1">“Repetitive Strain Injury: A Computer User’s Guide”</a> by Emil Pascarelli, M.D., and Deborah Quilter. This contains an absolute wealth of information about hand physiology, ergonomics, managing pain, and how to deal with medical help if you need it.</p>
<p><strong>Doctors and physical therapists:</strong> Not all physicians are aware of or trained in repetitive hand injuries, and you may have to work to get your insurance to cover it. In the Los Angeles area, there are physical therapy clinics that specialize in this type of rehabilitation; some research will help you find one that might work for you.</p>
<p><strong>RSI support groups:</strong> Many cities have support groups that meet regularly, in public libraries or other places, and offer informed speakers, suggested resources, and folks to commiserate with. An internet search may find resources in your community.</p>

<p><strong>——————</strong></p>
<p>A pro is someone who gets paid for what they do, pure and simple.</p>
<p>Compare this with the opposite, the definition of an amateur, who does the same thing only for the love of it (i.e. for free).</p>
<p>As soon as you get paid, you can legitimately call yourself a professional. A &#8216;Pro&#8217;.</p>
<p>But, ultimately, only by <em>being professional</em> can you get to this point <em>and stay there</em>.</p>
<p>A roundup of the qualities of the Pro Film Music Composer (by no means exhaustive!) follows…</p>
<p><strong>1.  It&#8217;s business, not a hobby</strong><br />
If you&#8217;re in this business as a pro, then you&#8217;re a businessman/woman. That means working regularly, persistently on not only your music but <em>on</em> your business.</p>
<p>Get your affairs in order: tax, insurance, working environment, legal requirements. You&#8217;re in this game to sell your music, to get paid for composing.</p>
<p><strong>2.  Be an expert</strong><br />
Educate yourself in composition, musical styles, and methods of collaboration and delivery.</p>
<p>Keep your knowledge up-to-date with new technological innovations, musical trends, media language, etc. Have an <em>informed</em> opinion.</p>
<p>Note: this does not mean jumping on the bandwagon/keeping-up-with-the-Jones&#8217; by buying every new piece of technology that comes out. This does mean knowing what&#8217;s new, what it can do, and what it may or may not be able to do for you now and in the future.</p>
<p><strong>3.  Be objective</strong><br />
You&#8217;re creating raw materials for someone else to manipulate, not a completely finished, final product. Don&#8217;t get precious.</p>
<p>Accept criticism graciously.  It&#8217;s not personal; even when it seems like it is. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>4.  Pro-actively research and create opportunities</strong><br />
Use downtime between gigs to update your showreel, website and promotional materials — you never know when you&#8217;ll get asked for them.</p>
<p>Seek out new contacts and build relationships; plan ahead, refine your business systems, identify potential new opportunities in the making, and then <em>go after them</em>.</p>
<p><strong>5.  Invest in your business</strong><br />
Invest <em>time</em> in your education, your experience, and in building relationships with potential clients.</p>
<p>Invest <em>money</em> in equipment — the right tool for the right job — and, again, in your education, both in your skills and in running a business.</p>
<p>Invest <em>energy</em>: this isn&#8217;t a job you can just fall into. It takes focus, motivation, persistence and courage. Get on and do it already.</p>
<p>Invest in your <em>team</em> and build support networks for streams of advice and leads on sources of work, and identify potential assistants and colleagues that can bring complementary skills when you might need them. Build your team in advance to save essential writing time when that call finally does come through.</p>
<p><strong>6.  Take responsibility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be responsible for your business; you know you&#8217;ve no-one to hold accountable but yourself.</li>
<li>Act professionally: deliver on time; be courteous, civilised, and amiable to work with, yet focused; be prepared for any and all contingencies you reasonably can be; learn from past mistakes and plan for future successes.</li>
</ul>
<p>So whilst being paid for a gig defines you in the moment as a &#8216;Pro&#8217;, <em>being</em> a Pro will more importantly get you to that point and give you the best shot at <em>staying</em> Pro!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a whole category of cliché that seems, at first glance, to revel in shallowness. &#8220;Fake it till you make it,&#8221; &#8220;image is everything,&#8221; &#8220;style over substance&#8221; and a bunch of others, all trumpeting the virtue of <em>looking</em> the part… to the detriment, one supposes, of actually <em>being</em> the part.</p>
<p>Our career, though, hinges on perception. In fact, film music could be said to be <em>all about</em> manipulating the perception of an audience (through music). So maybe there&#8217;s an argument to be made that these clichés, empty and soulless as they may seem, actually have some value for us in our day-to-day professional lives. More on image, and why it is actually important, after the jump.</p>
<p>The next time you&#8217;re at a gathering of film music professionals, take a look around. Compare the throng before you to the <a href="http://www.euphonix.com/pro/news/img/client_music/euph_HZimmer_piano.jpg">glossy</a> <a href="http://www.tracksounds.com/specialfeatures/cue/2007/cue_awards_2007_outstanding_composer.htm">publicity</a> <a href="http://www.suite101.com/view_image.cfm/891214">photos</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/media/rm448960512/nm0853380">candid</a> <a href="http://www.bearmccreary.com/blog/?p=2167">event</a> <a href="http://www.michaelgiacchinomusic.com/biography.htm">shots</a> of A-list film music personalities you see on websites, in trade magazines and newspapers. Realize that the images that these famous composers are sending out into the world are usually painstakingly calibrated to coordinate with their image — generally hip, creative, elite and expensive. (For plenty of others I&#8217;ve seen at events lately… not so much.)</p>
<p>At a certain point some A-listers actually budget for professionals to come in (a publicist, typically, or maybe a graphic designer, or a website consultant… the list goes on) and make them appear even <em>more</em> professional. Professionalism professionals.</p>
<p>Pretty <em>meta</em>, right? Or pretty <em>metro</em>, if you prefer. Either way, these folks clearly believe it gets results.</p>
<p>You may not be exercising much discrimination when it comes to your image, but an image of sorts—the <em>default</em> one, which for most of us falls under the heading of &#8220;…needs work&#8221; — is presenting itself nonetheless. It always does. And people come to associate the look with the profession.</p>
<p>Think about that the next time you see some bleary-eyed, socks-and-sandals composer crawling out from under their studio rock to bask briefly in the sun outside Starbucks.</p>
<p>Perception is reality… another cliché, sure, but when we&#8217;re interacting with individuals who have the power to make or break your career based on their hunches, or their intuition, or simply their <em>mood</em>, I think attention to professional presentation is worth a little head space. Too much is at stake to do otherwise.</p>
<p>These days it&#8217;s a hot topic of conversation to hold forth on those few of us who can command more than a pittance to do this job. I think one way the &#8220;million-dollar score&#8221; clique got there was to <em>look</em> like a million dollars.</p>
<p>It goes beyond the person, of course, to the entire setting: like so much of Hollywood, there&#8217;s a danger of obsessing over the right way to stock the koi pond, or whether it&#8217;s better to roll up to your director lunch in a Mercedes or a Maserati… but this whole thing doesn&#8217;t really have to be incredibly spendy or self-aggrandizing. <em>Really</em>, it doesn&#8217;t. And you don&#8217;t have to have the world&#8217;s greatest design sense to create a space and a &#8220;look&#8221; that communicates your own identity to your collaborators.</p>
<p>It just takes a little effort, and a little thought, and a little creativity. All stuff we&#8217;re good at. Be the kind of professional you&#8217;d like to be seen hanging out with. The kind you&#8217;d pay good money to work with. It&#8217;s a respect thing, that&#8217;s all. And respect is never a cliché.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Groucho Marx famously said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to belong to any club that will accept people like me as a member.&#8221; I tend to agree with that sentiment, and it&#8217;s a good thing I do&#8230; because <em>I don&#8217;t think that the AMCL wants me very much</em>.</p>
<p>Although the actions of the AMCL Steering Committee—the eleven men who have taken it upon themselves to spearhead the effort to unionize composers in Los Angeles under the Teamsters Local 399 banner—have run a somewhat confusing gamut from ill-prepared to scatter-brained to misinformed to moderately victorious, one thing is particularly clear: The AMCL and the Teamsters Union have <em><strong>zero</strong></em> intentions of unionizing ALL composers. They only want the &#8220;working ones&#8221;.</p>
<p>What does that mean? AMCL Steering Committee member Mike Post, one of the most successful (if not THE most successful) composers in television history, said at the last AMCL meeting at the WGA that he will not &#8220;be part of a union that is run by non-working people&#8221;. Well, so far, the Teamsters have not been too picky about who has turned in one of those all-important orange cards that Steve Dayan makes certain to mention every time he speaks into a microphone. I&#8217;d like to meet the poor bastard that the AMCL is paying to make sure that each one of those orange cards was turned in by a composer who is&#8230; <em>working</em>. He must be one hell of a researcher!</p>
<p>Which leads me to my first of many questions: What IS a &#8220;working composer&#8221;, anyway? Is it someone who is doing commercials? Working on a short film? Is it someone who only composes a feature film score once every 18 months&#8230; maybe in-between concert music commissions? What is the AMCL&#8217;s definition of a &#8220;working composer&#8221;? Because let&#8217;s face it—there&#8217;s &#8220;working&#8221; like Mike Post works, and then there&#8217;s &#8220;working&#8221; like the rest of us work. Pretty different stories, methinks.</p>
<p>The AMCL has stated that they are &#8220;in the process of&#8221; determining what they deem is a <em>working composer.</em> They&#8217;ve stated that they are in the midst of &#8220;looking into how many composers are currently working&#8221;. Who are they kidding? That&#8217;s not even possible. Laughable, yes, but possible? No. They&#8217;ve also stated that the way in which they are going about documenting the number of productions that are potential union signatories is to scour through IMDb and single out every production that has a casting director attached. &#8220;If there is a casting director working on a production, surely those productions will also have a composer&#8221;, said Steve Dayan at the first AMCL meeting at Pickwick Gardens in Burbank.</p>
<p>In that case, I hereby make it public that I&#8217;ll buy a pizza for the first person to go over and educate the Teamsters on how movies are being made these days in Hollywood. They seem to think that each film being made has the budget to hire someone to come in and set up a process by which they will audition actors for their roles. Oh. My. God.</p>
<p>These things seem to me—you know&#8230; ME: The guy that doesn&#8217;t currently have a primetime network franchise that he&#8217;s composing for—to be Unionizing 101. A clarified mission, realistic goals, and attainable objectives all seem to me like things you might want to hammer out BEFORE you get a large number of people together and pitch a union to them. But, that&#8217;s just me.</p>
<p>The recent &#8220;confusion&#8221; over the AMCL&#8217;s focus when they start negotiations with the AMPTP is another thing that doesn&#8217;t make a whole lot of sense. It&#8217;s like the Bush White House every time we all get together in a group in front of the AMCL dais: They tell us one thing, and then a week later, they circulate information that stands in contrast. Benefits only&#8230; wage minimums. Benefits only&#8230;. wage minimums. Benefits only&#8230; wage minimums. I feel like I&#8217;m at the World Table Tennis Championship.</p>
<p>As far as the Teamsters involvement? I thought that it would be a complete disaster, but honestly, I&#8217;ve been pleasantly surprised. That is until the two big ballbusters from the Teamsters got up in front of everyone at the last meeting and proceeded to tell us things like &#8220;we know how to inflict misery&#8221;. Throughout this process, Steve Dayan has only alluded to the history of the Teamsters via a few well-placed jokes, yet it has remained one of the elephants in the room out in the community. After the display of Teamster support at this last WGA meeting, I found myself giving a little more credence to some of the stories I&#8217;ve heard about our Teamster &#8220;friends&#8221;. Try as I might, I can&#8217;t seem to reconcile the concept of <em>pencil-on-manuscript</em> with the image of <em>tire iron-on-kneecap</em>. But again, that&#8217;s just me.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s just too much cloak-and-dagger, secret-society bullshit going on with these two groups, and it&#8217;s starting to make this composer (I&#8217;m STILL not sure if I&#8217;m considered a working composer, or just a regular guy yet) a little uneasy. I&#8217;ll oblige with yet another example.</p>
<p>In recent months, mysterious letters and reprints of emails sent by Steve Dayan to other professional film industry unions were popping up around our community like heads on a Whack-A-Mole at Chuck E. Cheese&#8217;s. These letters and emails outlined a request for support from these unions on the basis of several criteria that the AMCL would negotiate for with the AMPTP, including, but not limited to, <em>working conditions</em> and <em>wage minimums</em>. Shortly after that, the AMCL issued numerous statements (both verbally by Bruce Broughton at the WGA meeting and through a mass email sent to his AMCL mailing list) telling us that an underground rogue group had been disseminating false information in an effort to screw with everybody&#8217;s heads on this Benefits Only vs. Wage Minimums issue. Ummm&#8230; okaaay. Who could that possibly be? Who could possibly have access to the AMCL&#8217;s mailing list, other than the guys running the&#8230;&#8230;..WAIT A MINUTE!!!!!</p>
<blockquote><p>ALAN ELLIOTT.</p></blockquote>
<p>The guy who started the AMCL and then mysteriously &#8220;resigned&#8221; right after Mike Post and Co. signed on to the committee. The guy crying at the top of his lungs at the initial meeting about how minimums would &#8220;get us back to the way that things used to be 30 years ago when film music was a respected art form.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is just my opinion, and there is no evidence—zero, zip, zilch—that Elliott was behind leaking those emails, but it makes sense that the guy who is asked to leave his own organization because he&#8217;s too much of a loose cannon retaliates by sending confusing messages to the constituency. Steve Jobs, eat your heart out!</p>
<p>Even so, what the hell is going on here? Not many people are making public mention of the fact that it looks as though the AMCL is saying one thing, yet doing another. At the WGA, someone brought up the question as to whether or not this new AMCL stance of &#8220;Benefits Only&#8221; was a Trojan Horse—that the committee was using that as a catalyst to build the union, and then start piling on the non-starter issues that everyone is embarrassed to even talk about anymore, seeing as they made no sense from the get-go. After those leaked emails from Steve Dayan, how can you NOT wonder the same thing?</p>
<p>The members of the AMCL Steering Committee want &#8220;pro&#8221; composers ONLY. I get that. I completely understand why, and I see that it makes perfect sense. I really do. Nobody wants a government run by non-taxpaying citizens, either. Unfortunately, despite the interest of the committee in the &#8220;pros&#8221; in our community, I could fill twenty pages with examples of the &#8220;un-professionalism&#8221; that is leading this effort from the dais. Having said that, I DO believe that the intentions of the committee are of the purest. I REALLY do. I totally believe that. I do not think for one minute that the men on this committee desire to see anything but good come of this possible union with the Teamsters Local 399.</p>
<p>However, until this committee starts showing us composers—working and non-working—that they are capable of acting professionally in the deep water that they now want to swim in; until they can clearly identify the TRUE reason for their wanting to unionize composers, with no interference from &#8220;rogue&#8221; groups and no mysterious letters to other industry unions popping up left and right; until they can give us a clear and honest reason as to why they blatantly and openly solicited orange cards from young, emerging, student composers in an effort to get the first seedlings of their grass-roots effort off the ground, yet are now avoiding that particular demographic like the plague—my little orange card is staying right where it has been since the first meeting back in November&#8230; in my dresser drawer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sig-sanders.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-514" title="sig-sanders" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sig-sanders.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>This weekend I&#8217;m once again consumed with work: finding it… doing it… following up afterwards. It reminds me that one sign of a real pro is that he or she is extremely careful with time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said it before in this very column: in the end, what we&#8217;re all playing for is time. One of the best uses for the money we make is to buy us a little more time here and there… more time to polish up a demo; more time to strengthen relationships with our filmmaker contacts; more time to spend outside of music, with family and friends. And all the thousand other things that make your life a <em>life</em>.</p>
<p>Running a professional composing business is a lot like running a restaurant—besides the amusing comparisons to junk food, fast food and kitchens full of too many cooks (!), there&#8217;s the idea that there&#8217;s always something to do. Whatever time exists will all get spent on a given (menu/project).</p>
<p>For example, I&#8217;m using my time right now to write this. I could have written it last night, but I needed that time to finish up demo edits on a few cues for a project demo I&#8217;m working on next week. I could have written it tomorrow morning, but that&#8217;s my time for taking care of business stuff.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m writing this now, because it&#8217;s actually a pretty great use of my time: I&#8217;m on an airplane somewhere over New Mexico, updating this text file via the in-flight wi-fi (don&#8217;t worry; by the time you read this I&#8217;ll be back in action at the Gulag!).</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t really write music with the laptop all that effectively (although here in a few minutes I <em>will</em> be working on some scores and parts!), so being able to remain productive like this is what I consider time well spent.</p>
<p>Just a quick anecdote, but the point is an important one: part of being truly professional is building a subroutine into your thought process that automatically seeks out these kinds of efficiencies. Even when it&#8217;s not crucial. Because once it becomes crucial—i.e., once you&#8217;re down in the trenches of an actual gig, for pay, with actual deadlines—it&#8217;ll be too late to have to think about all the great ideas and habits we talk about constantly on here.</p>
<p>Build &#8217;em in beforehand, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying. You perform like you practice… fake it till you make it… pick whatever cliché you like. But remember to be <em>careful</em> with the ultimate finite commodity for us all: time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My goal in starting this website and podcast has always been to make our professional film music community “smaller” as we naturally grow “larger”. Over the past year, our website has undergone many alterations and we&#8217;ve experimented with various ways to communicate and interact as a community. Some of these methods have worked and some of them have needed further tweaking, but we&#8217;ve always strived to make SCO the very best experience it can be. To commemorate our anniversary, we will be launching even more new features at SCOREcastOnline.com in the coming weeks that will make the site even more robust as we seek to better serve this community.</p>
<p>One of the things that I believe differentiates SCO from the rest of the pack is that we are all <em>working professionals</em>—none of us are offerring knowledge or putting something out there for public consumption that isn&#8217;t a tried and true method, technique, philosophy, or question in our own daily working film music routine. It annoys me to no end to encounter people who really have no idea what it is like being a working professional in this business, yet they either want to tell you all about how to do it or they have an opinion that they feel is relevant— never mind the fact that they haven&#8217;t written a note or edited or mixed music for the last fifteen years. How can this person *truly* know what it is like NOW in the film music business, other than to simply speculate on something they know very little about? (And for the record, I&#8217;m NOT talking to those of you who are just coming up in the biz—&#8221;Looking for&#8221; work and &#8220;talking about&#8221; work are two different things. To me, one is of merit. The other? Not so much.)</p>
<p>Which leads me to a potential discussion with you: <strong><em>GOING PRO</em></strong>. What does that mean? What is the difference between being a <em>professional</em> film composer, music editor, orchestrator—what have you—and being an <em>amateur</em> hobbyist?</p>
<p>Understand this difference: I&#8217;m NOT asking, &#8220;How does a person <em>make the leap</em> from being an amateur to being a professional?&#8221; Or even, &#8220;How do you <em>break into</em> the working community?&#8221; Instead, I&#8217;m seeking to illustrate and highlight the <em>differences</em> in the two species—because a working film composer and a film composer who isn&#8217;t working are two VERY different animals… and the reasons why, at least to me, are extremely telling and very educational for all of us at every stage of the career.</p>
<p>Like many of my working colleagues who&#8217;ve had any amount of success at this gig, I&#8217;ve lectured in plenty of film music classes at the university level. After years and years of doing so and talking with hundreds—if not thousands—of students, my spirit of discernment operates at a fairly high level: I&#8217;m able to tell which students have the chutzpah and internal drive to eventually find their way into the professional ranks and which ones do not.</p>
<p>I have a lot to say on this topic, and I&#8217;ll spread it out over the rest of May in various articles I&#8217;ll write, but in the meantime, and to get the party started, here are two immediate thoughts that come to mind that I feel are relevant to all of us:</p>
<p><strong>Personal Responsibility</strong><br />
Everyone screws up. On almost every project I&#8217;ve ever worked on, somebody somewhere has messed something up. Sometimes the mistake is small and it goes unnoticed and gets swept under the rug, and sometimes it&#8217;s a Category 5 disaster that cannot be ignored and the entire scoring team, from the studio executives on down, hears about the blunder. Usually, with some quick thinking and a little magic dust, it is fixable. Sometimes it costs the person their job.</p>
<p>No matter what, and in every case, a <em>professional</em> takes the responsibility for everything they do, good or bad, pretty or ugly. There is no pointing fingers, no whining about how someone else is to blame. If you did it, you own it.</p>
<p>As a film music pro, there is no surer way to kill your career than passing the responsibility buck. I used to compose music for NBC&#8217;s &#8220;The Apprentice&#8221;, and &#8220;The Celebrity Apprentice&#8221; is still a huge guilty pleasure in my home for both me and my family (I finally got them hooked!). One thing that has always fascinated me about that show is how well the teams work together and have each other&#8217;s backs. That is… UNTIL they get to the Boardroom, where they, without fail, start throwing each other under the bus in an effort to stay on one more week. While I understand that this is part of the dynamic that makes a show like this work, it still blows my mind how far people are willing to go to cast blame on others for what are so obviously their own poor decisions. Many times, Trump sees right through this kind of crap and yells, &#8220;You&#8217;re Fired!&#8221;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s worse? These are all people who are <em>working professionals</em>! Truthfully, I&#8217;ve lost much respect for many &#8220;celebrities&#8221; that I once held in high regard by watching them sell their teammates out to stay alive one more week. This isn&#8217;t an indictment on Reality TV. It is an indictment on not taking Personal Responsibility For Your Own Actions. You have to own your own shit. If you did it, face it and be a professional about it. Own up to it, fix it quick, and move on with getting your job done.</p>
<p>Everybody makes mistakes, but one of the things that differentiates a <em>professional</em> from an <em>amateur</em> is the ability to own up, apologize appropriately, and make things right.</p>
<p><strong>Acting vs. Reacting</strong><br />
This is another personal core value of mine, and it&#8217;s a doozy.</p>
<p>Are you the kind of person who <em>waits</em>? <em>Waits</em> for someone to call, <em>waits</em> until April 15th to file taxes, <em>waits</em> to have the tough conversation, <em>waits</em> to deal with broken gear, <em>waits</em> to put processes and people in place until &#8220;I absolutely need to&#8221;, <em>waits</em> to demo for a project until it shows up on IMDb, <em>waits</em>, <em>waits</em>, <em>waits</em>, <em>waits</em>, <em>waits</em>?????</p>
<p>If yes, then you&#8217;ve got a problem. Mark my words: You are going to have a hard time in the film music business.</p>
<p>Again, a delineation: I&#8217;m not talking about &#8220;timing&#8221;. <em>Appropriate Timing </em>is an art unto itself that I will discuss later this month as we dive deeper into Professionalism. No, I&#8217;m referring to &#8220;putting things off&#8221;. <em>Procrastinating</em>.</p>
<p>I like to do the opposite. I act NOW. If I hear about a project in it&#8217;s early stages of pre-production and I want it—I jump on it TODAY. Not tomorrow, not Friday… TODAY. If I learn of a potential scheduling conflict that is headed my way, I handle it this very second. I do not&#8230; <em>wait</em>.</p>
<p>I pay estimated quarterly taxes. I don&#8217;t wait for April 15th to do all of that work. I pay business expenses at the beginning of the month instead of at the end. I deal with staffing issues when they happen, not after they unfold. I take my team out for regular <em>play dates </em>instead of waiting until they are dragging ass and need a jolt of emergency R&amp;R.</p>
<p>I diagnose computers or take them to the &#8220;doctor&#8221; at the first sign of trouble rather than waiting for them to go belly-up two days before a deadline.</p>
<p>I initiate conversations with producers and directors and I do not wait for them to seek me out by word of mouth. I make it a point to network, socialize, and mingle. I work to meet and befriend at least one new person in my life every single day.</p>
<p>I return all of my calls and emails once in the morning and once before I go home for the day. I follow up with all of my team members on each project by sending something nice (when appropriate) or telling them in person how much I appreciate them.</p>
<p>All of these things are in an effort to <em>work ahead of schedule</em>. Ultimately, it all becomes important on the day that a big project hits my studio, along with the realization that if these things aren&#8217;t already done, they won&#8217;t get done for the next 4-6 weeks. At that point, it&#8217;s too late—I&#8217;m committed. The work now dictates how I can spend my time, and no matter what, I have to maintain focus to meet my project&#8217;s deadline. This means that many of these aforementioned tasks must fall by the wayside in order to meet that commitment, and so I must operated in my &#8220;downtime&#8221; with a bias toward working ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>Most people I have encountered that are only sort of poking around with the idea of making a career out of composing act exactly counter to the way I just described. They toy around with these things. But <em>professionals</em> don&#8217;t. And if you want to ascend to the next terrace in your career, you can&#8217;t either.</p>
<p>I had an instructor once who used to tell us that the best way to get to the next level in anything in life—sports, music, business, relationships, fitness… whatever—is to &#8220;start living and acting on that level&#8221;. How true this is.</p>
<p>Where are you headed and what do you need to change in order to get there?</p>
<p>I await your comments below.</p>

It could not exist in its current form without your efforts.</p>
<div>For the sake of your growth as a composer, sound designer, or other post-production professionals, you must underline the importance to your own psyche that this is a moment to be emphasized and cherished, that it is something desirable &#8211; and so to be repeated.</div>
<div>How often have you actually gotten to the stage of delivery in all of your projects? As Lee said in <a href="../../../2010/04/delivery-finaling-and-changing-world.html">this post</a>, it&#8217;s never a done deal that the project will complete and you&#8217;ll be able to get to that all-important stage of delivering your musical opus. So when you do get there… celebrate!</div>
<p><span id="more-297"></span></p>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"> </span><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="font-family: inherit;">Reap the Rewards</span></strong> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Reward yourself &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t have to be expensive, it doesn&#8217;t have to mean going on vacation for 3 months, but it must be significant. </span></span></div>
<div>You want to spend a day reading that book you never have time to get around to? Do it, and enjoy it, and banish any feelings of guilt that you should instead be working on something else!</div>
<div>Go out for a meal, go sit in the park, by the beach, catch up with friends over a coffee. For a certain length of time, be it a week, a day, or even just a few hours, get a change of scenery or schedule and just have fun.</div>
<div>Reward your family and friends, the ones that stuck by you when you were working long hours, the ones that made sure you ate properly and kept the roof over your head whilst you were waiting for the installments to come through, those who had their ears bent whilst you whined about how the project may not have been going to plan or you were having a tough time with a colleague.</div>
<div>You know who they are. Let them know that they&#8217;re appreciated and that they had a significant hand in you achieving this success &#8211; and that they get rewarded too!</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Space and Time</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The importance of stepping back and allowing a little space and time to reflect on the processes and experiences you&#8217;ve gone through to reach the success of delivering cannot be overstated.</span></span></div>
<div><a href="../../../2010/04/weekend-provocation-post-mortem-edition.html">Lee&#8217;s post on the &#8216;Post-Mortem&#8217; process</a> illustrates this very effectively: check what went wrong, system-wise and operationally, select material for demo versions and samples, paperwork and admin updates, thanking people who helped get the project to this stage.</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gratitude</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">I think the point Lee mentions at the end is possibly the most significant in the long run: Gratitude. Being thankful to yourself that you worked hard to get to this point in the project &#8211; that delivering a finished, finalized score is no mean feat &#8211; is essential. </span></span></div>
<div>You have the skills and the talent to achieve something great, possibly life-changing but at least enjoyable for those that hear and experience the project, whatever form it takes. Acknowledge this.</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recharge Your Creative Batteries</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Going from one project to the next without a period of time to recharge can be dangerous. Creative burnout is a serious issue for those of us working in the creative industries, not least because the creative value we produce is our source of money! </span></span></div>
<div>Having a temporal buffer between projects is essential not only for the reward and analysis procedures already mentioned, but for recharging your creative batteries. Get some distance from the music and sound themes of the project just delivered, or risk inadvertently re-hashing those themes and ideas for the next gig.</div>
<div>You need time to let those ideas go and to get prepared for the excitement of new themes, textures and colors that will come to you, given that chance.</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Accept Compliments Gracefully</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Finally, in acknowledging your own achievement in delivering an awesome score on schedule in an organized and professional manner… you must also learn to notice and accept the compliments and acknowledgments of others! If someone praises your work, say thank you! Do not put down the achievement with, &#8216;it was nothing,&#8217; or other such self-effacing statements. </span></span></div>
<div>You know as well as I do: it certainly was not nothing.</div>
<div><span style="font-family: inherit;">By acknowledging success and accepting compliments graciously, you will build confidence in your abilities and improve your self-esteem, which will ultimately mean the improvement of you as a composer.</span> <span style="font-family: inherit;">You&#8217;ll be more assured of your skills and potential, will have more faith in your own ideas and opinions about the use of music and sound in film.</span></div>
<div>Rather than staying within the safety and security of &#8216;what works&#8217;, you&#8217;ll be more willing to take the risks required to create something genuinely brilliant and different next time.</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">In conclusion&#8230;</span></div>
<div>Having the time and space to reflect is no luxury. It is an essential part of the process, a tool not only to analyze and correct any problems, but to gratefully accept the success that you&#8217;ve achieved in delivering this score.</div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Ultimately, it will only make you a stronger and better prepared for the next gig!</span></span></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sig-sanders2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-767" title="sig-sanders" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sig-sanders2.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>This weekend&#8217;s post ties together a couple of the topics we&#8217;ve touched on during first year here at SCOREcast (has it really been almost a year… we ought to do something to celebrate! Hmm…): delivery and studio organization. The question, then:</p>
<p><strong>Is a gig ever really over?</strong> Sometimes it&#8217;s clear when you&#8217;re finished (especially if things go, how you say, <em>not</em> so well). Other times, though, it seems that these ghosts of gigs past come back to haunt us over and over. More on all of this after the jump.<span id="more-296"></span></p>
<p>Something that happens more often than you&#8217;d think around here is this: I&#8217;ll get a suspiciously friendly phone call from a filmmaker I haven&#8217;t spoken to in a while. In the midst of catching up, I&#8217;ll hear that he has some Exciting News! (oboy.)</p>
<p>…Their two-year-old (or three-year-old, or six-year-old, or older) project has just been picked up by a distributor. Or they&#8217;re re-editing it for a festival. Or they just want to spruce it up or &#8220;dot all the i&#8217;s&#8221; before moving on to something new.</p>
<p>And, of course, there are a few teeeensy little technical details that need to be ironed out, the pace of technology being what it is and what-not.</p>
<p>Here it comes: Can I, their Amazing Composer, take a quick second and look through my files and send along:<br />
A) the cue sheet<br />
B) the Composer Agreement (funny how filmmakers and production companies seem to lose these!)<br />
C) a complete set of audio files/stems of the score<br />
D) a couple of revised versions of cues that &#8220;we never really nailed,&#8221; or maybe even…<br />
E) a new version of the score, mixed in 5.1 instead of stereo? (Don&#8217;t laugh about that last one. It&#8217;s happened.)</p>
<p>Well, some of this is just a good laugh on a weekday morning. There&#8217;s no way you&#8217;re gonna volunteer for this kind of duty. But it costs them nothing to see if they can squeeze a little extra work and hassle out of you for free, so they&#8217;re giving it a shot.</p>
<p>But short of that, there&#8217;s a wide range of requests that we might legitimately consider to be part of the ongoing commitment we take on when we sign our composer agreements. We should, for example, keep all of our paperwork, filed away so that we can access it whenever it&#8217;s needed. This kind of paperwork should <em>never</em> be thrown away.</p>
<p>Likewise, it shouldn&#8217;t be too time-consuming to re-deliver the score (unless your internet connection is sloooow). If they want a new <em>physical</em> version mailed to them, my opinion is that they should cover the costs of materials and postage. And they should volunteer to pay for that (but they usually don&#8217;t).</p>
<p>By the way, a similar syndrome can manifest itself before <em>any</em> time has elapsed, and I had a phone call about this from a colleague just today. Here&#8217;s how this one goes: You&#8217;re ready to submit a set of library cues to (insert name of Big Library Music Company, or maybe even Cable Network Executive, here).</p>
<p>Not only are you getting no money up front for this ingenious piece of entrepreneurship, but you get a call from the recipient asking either A) if they can keep the hard drive(s) on which you submitted the material (at which point you&#8217;re paying for the privilege of giving your music away—!) or B) if you don&#8217;t mind creating an online-searchable database of those cues… you know, &#8220;so you can be competitive with the other companies submitting cues. We don&#8217;t really want to waste time with a library if it&#8217;s not searchable online.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, those are nearly the exact words my colleague heard over the phone not 12 hours ago. As the executive was holding music placement for something like 100 cable episodes over his head. The beauty of this is that later in the conversation, the same exec uttered the phrase &#8220;I&#8217;m not comfortable with the idea of having some invoice from you hanging over my head.&#8221; (re: the hard drives, which I&#8217;m supposing the exec wanted the composer to offer up as a gift, free of obligation to use the music inside.)</p>
<p>That, to me, is equal parts painfully obscene and beautifully surreal.</p>
<p>Again, something this gratuitous is worthy of derisive laugher and not much else. But other requests sound so easy, so not-a-big-deal-just-this-once that you might get sucked in. Please, for the sake of the rest of us, consider what sort of standard operating procedure you&#8217;re committing to… and committing the rest of us to, by default.</p>
<p>Getting back to the larger point: you should have a system in place to deliver old materials. That includes organizing your completed works in such a way that they&#8217;re accessible and current in format (Jaz drives ain&#8217;t gonna cut it!). You should also take a little time when you&#8217;re not under the pressure of deadlines, to decide exactly what your own boundaries are with respect to this stuff. There are some gray areas here, which you&#8217;ll need to define on your own.</p>
<p>For example: should you be required to re-mix? Probably not. But you might be willing to batch-convert the audio into a different format if you&#8217;re asked. Or you might not. Should you re-send paperwork? Sure. But should you be willing to chase down signatures if that original paperwork never got fully executed? That&#8217;s sort of up to you.</p>
<p>Those, plus dozens of scenarios and situations I&#8217;m forgetting or incapable of imagining. They&#8217;ll all happen over the course of your career. Get out in front of them now, while it&#8217;s (relatively) easy.</p>
<p>Whatever your personal &#8220;lines in the sand&#8221; are, you should take a little time and consider how you&#8217;re going to handle phone calls like the ones above. While you&#8217;re at it, make a note to tighten up your organizational system… never throw anything away… keep an eye on new formats and figure out a strategy for transferring your data on a regular basis as your old media become obsolete.</p>
<p>Because it never ends.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[To a do-it-yourself composer working on student films, non-paying gigs, super-low-paying gigs, and other micro-projects (although don’t call them that!), delivery may not seem like that big of a deal.

<p>Maybe I don’t know much of what I’m talking about. I’ve done a couple very small projects. But as I’ve mentioned in previous posts, I’m bringing my “day job” experience to bear as well. In my day job, if I have a presentation to give to the Board of Directors, I don’t just go in with a scribbled-on legal pad. I use the official corporate PowerPoint template, organize my notes, think through what I’m going to talk about, and dress nicely. Sure, the information I present would be the same whether I’m in flip-flops or Florsheims. But like it or not, delivery is critical to establishing or maintaining credibility as a professional.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m trying to do here is urge any of you <em>start-up composers</em> to not to disregard &#8220;big-budget&#8221; delivery concepts simply because you may not be working on a &#8220;big-budget&#8221; project. Soak up every bit of advice. <em>Now</em> is the time to learn, take some risks, experiment, and make some mistakes. Read every SCO article you can, do some writing (documents, not music) to get your thoughts down about how you may want to handle certain situations. Research tools and techniques to better manage your computer files. Develop a letterhead and business cards. Go check out <a href="http://www.garageband.com/mp3cat/.UZCMYySG562u/01_SCOREcast_No_17__The_NEW_SCOREcast___How_to_Give_G.mp3">SCOREcast’s Podcast #17</a> on how to deliver a killer demo, and apply it to everything you deliver. It’s best to get all the details out of the way and know what you’re doing before you get too busy writing music to figure it all out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And the Oscar goes to&#8230;.</p>
<p>Michael Giacchino for &#8220;UP!&#8221;.</p>
<p>Even though Jennifer Lopez and Sam Worthington butchered his name many times during their presentation for &#8220;Best Original Score&#8221; at the Academy Awards on Sunday night, there was no denying who won the award once Michael Giacchino got up and took the statue in his hands. With a simple speech about how kids who have dreams of entering into the entertainment industry should never listen to those who say it is &#8220;a waste of time&#8221;, Giacchino accepted his award with grace and respect, and then went and sat back down in his seat for the rest of the show.</p>
<p>With a contentious race in many categories, including Best Original Score, it didn&#8217;t take long before I was seeing people on Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, and Tumblr light into Giacchino, assessing his win as a &#8220;fraud&#8221;, a &#8220;mistake&#8221;, a &#8220;travesty&#8221;, &#8220;non-deserving&#8221;, and even &#8220;political&#8221; (Political? WTF? Really?) Since the awards broadcast, I&#8217;ve even received several emails from people in our community asking me what I thought of &#8220;someone like Giacchino winning the award up against Horner and Hans&#8221;.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Someone like Giacchino?&#8221; </em>What does that even mean?</p>
<p>Over the last 24 hours, the vitriolic criticism of Giacchino&#8217;s win is, frankly, astounding — things I&#8217;m ashamed to even mention here&#8230; so I won&#8217;t. Suffice it to say that some of the things I&#8217;ve read are some of the most ridiculous arguments against <em>anyone</em> winning <em>any</em> award at <em>any</em> ceremony for <em>anything</em> they&#8217;ve <em>ever</em> accomplished. It&#8217;s just been plain stupid.</p>
<p>Before I continue, I want to make it clear: I do not know Michael Giacchino. I&#8217;ve never met the man. I do know many people on his team, and have worked with people who also have worked with him, but I do not know him personally. I will say that in the years I&#8217;ve been working and living in Los Angeles as a film composer, I&#8217;ve never heard a sideways word about Giacchino. That aside, however, what cannot be argued is that Giacchino is one of the busiest composers in the business, and in this industry, you don&#8217;t get to keep coming to the sleepovers if you continually poop the bed. So I have to wonder what the motivation is to cut this guy down. I don&#8217;t get it.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t matter whether I know Mr. Giacchino or not. The things I&#8217;ve read over the last twenty-four hours have surprised even this composer, who thought that he&#8217;d seen it all and heard it all. To be sure, cutting down others isn&#8217;t unheard of in this town, especially considering that a high level of competition is one of the main cords that binds our little community together and makes it so interesting. Competition, as we talked about last month here at SCOREcast, comes with the territory of being in business for one&#8217;s self, no matter what the profession.</p>
<p>But who are the people chattering in the dark about Giacchino, only 24 hours after his Oscar victory?</p>
<p><strong><em>Composers.</em></strong></p>
<p>Giacchino&#8217;s own community of colleagues are the ones doing the cutting. It&#8217;s not some Nicolas Chartier-conspiracy that is to blame for this. It&#8217;s his own community.</p>
<p>And it extends beyond Michael Giacchino. In fact, here at SCOREcast, we&#8217;ve seen all kinds of listeners and readers write in with negative accusations and heated and highly-charged opinions about the alleged detriment of Hans Zimmer&#8217;s influence in the community, as well as allegations of him being someone who doesn&#8217;t do what he proclaims he does — and I&#8217;ve never understood it. Is it jealousy? Envy? Anger? What?</p>
<p>Year after year, month after month, day after day, I hear composers in this industry talk about how &#8220;the studios are the enemy, our craft is under-appreciated, our budgets are laughable, and there is no work out there for anyone. But I would propose this, instead:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s not the studios&#8217; fault, or the economy, or the projects and budgets shrinking that has led to the composing community being the red-headed step-child of the filmmaking process. It&#8217;s the composers. It is our fault. <em>We do it to ourselves.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Is it any wonder that this community is trying to argue the need for a union predicated largely on that fact that undercutting each other for gigs has become a way of life? Is that the fault of the studios? Of course not. So in other words, we need a union to protect us from&#8230; us. Nice.</p>
<p>There are many things wrong with the system, but therefore, since the system is run by people, the people need to change before the system will change. Reform happens when people get sick and tired of being sick and tired and mobilize to change themselves and the things they can control. Reform doesn&#8217;t happen when people mobilize to change things that are beyond of their control.</p>
<p>So, with that, allow me to speak directly to <em>you</em>:<br />
<strong><br />
COMPOSERS</strong><br />
Stop your bitching. You think Hans deserved the award over Giacchino? Marco? Desplat? Horner? Perhaps so. But they didn&#8217;t get it. For whatever reason (and I have my own, but again, they don&#8217;t matter!) the Academy found them all wanting and deemed Giacchino&#8217;s score the best work of 2009. Do you really have nothing better to do than to sit around for 24 hours and make case after case as to why you believe Michael doesn&#8217;t deserve this honor? As if you know anything about playing at that level yet? How about a few positive strokes to a fellow colleague for winning something that only five people, out of hundreds of thousands, were in the running for? I mean, I know the Oscars can be political&#8230; but really? Giacchino? I never saw any lobbying on his part for the award. Not once. No ads, no commercials. I spend a fair amount of time on the Disney lot. There was nobody standing outside of the music department handing out &#8220;UP!&#8221; CDs with <em>&#8220;For Your Consideration&#8221;</em> embossed across them (I know they exist, but you know what I mean!). No giant billboards with Giacchino&#8217;s name and likeness sprawled out for us all to see.</p>
<p>C&#8217;mon. Examine what it is in you that feels the need to cut someone down every time they accomplish something you do not. This extends to losing gigs to other composers, losing awards to other composers, having the fame and fortune (huh?) of other composers, and having the nice studio that another composer might have. So&#8230; you haven&#8217;t made it to their level yet. So what. Go write something that is worthy of an accolade. Go orchestrate one of your cues in a manner that is worth us all listening to. Hone your skills. Get better. WRITE BETTER MUSIC and get competitive *that* way. Updating your status on Facebook to reflect your disgust for what someone else has beat you to is not only childish and stupid but also petty and ugly. My SCOREcast cohort Lee Sanders and I compete with each other ALL THE TIME, yet I consider Lee one of my best friends and I cannot imagine him not in my life.</p>
<p>Stop whining about what you are NOT getting and start working toward what you CAN get. Nobody is going to feel bad that you think your music is better than someone else&#8217;s and why couldn&#8217;t a producer just give you a chance — no one is going to give you a chance until you learn to shut your negative mouth&#8230; <em>and take some chances</em>. If you don&#8217;t risk yourself a bit, who would ever bother risking themselves for you?<br />
<strong><br />
REPRESENTATIVES</strong><br />
Start being genuine. Quit pitting composers against other composers in your same stable (I know you&#8217;ll never do this, but we all have always wondered how you can possibly look us in the eye with a straight face after doing so&#8230;. so what the hell. I&#8217;m putting it out there.)</p>
<p>Bet on us like we bet on you. Work a little harder toward at least making us feel like we are the only client you have. I know some of you do that now, and kudos to those of you who operate in that way — I am one of the lucky clients of someone whom I never have to worry about in that regard. But for others of you, your clients will be the first to tell you that you make them feel small, worthless, insignificant, and unimportant. Stop texting and taking calls while we are trying to talk business with you. Rid yourself of the phrase, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&#8230; I have to take this!&#8221; when you are in our presence. Whomever it is, I&#8217;m sure they can wait 30 minutes until we are done talking. Try and remember the details of things we tell you we are interested in pursuing. Write it down somewhere or something. Buy some Sticky Notes. Get an iPhone.</p>
<p>Focus more on career development than on agency development. Let the success of your clients be the catalyst by which word of mouth champions your brand. You promote us, and we&#8217;ll promote you. It&#8217;s pretty simple. Of all of the people in this industry, you have the greatest vantage point as to the path a career should go (and is capable of going). Share your reality with us. Wake us up. Guide us. Help us. Direct us. Shape and mold us. We&#8217;ll listen — we respect you. If we didn&#8217;t, we probably wouldn&#8217;t be working with you anyway — it&#8217;s not like we can give up hunting down our own gigs just because we have representation. That&#8217;s not a slam, it&#8217;s just the way this business works. We are a team, and if the whole team hunts, the whole team eats. Teach us how to be better hunters. We <em>want</em> to make you rich.</p>
<p><strong>IN CLOSING&#8230;</strong><br />
When I started SCOREcast in 2006, my aim was to bring our community closer together — for us to grow smaller as we grow larger. A little of that has happened and it makes me very happy. But the reality of the situation is that no podcast, website, technology, organization, procedure, or process can really do what needs to be done to make that fully happen. Only the people can. Only we can, as people. Composers and their teams have to start supporting each other and learning how to be positive and encouraging, rather than negative and destructive towards one another.</p>
<p>I am not advocating us turning a blind eye to the very real issues that plague our profession, but rather than instead of shaking our heads and complaining about them, we instead take some action and take an active role in the process of correcting them. It is so easy to sit on the sidelines and &#8220;armchair-quarterback&#8221; as the game is played on the field by others.</p>
<p>Start being a lightning rod of good in this community. I challenge you to that. We need that from you. Stop posturing on your Facebook pages and your Twitter accounts against those that have worked hard to get where they are. I don&#8217;t care what you think of Hans Zimmer. Have you met him? Have you sat and talked with him? Maybe you could learn a lot from someone in his position. Better yet, maybe you could learn something from him as a person. As a human being. Forget his music. What kind of wisdom could he impart to you as someone who has worked himself to the top of the heap and doesn&#8217;t look to be going anywhere soon? Michael Giacchino, in the grand scheme of things, is a relative newcomer to the game. He is one of the first of the &#8220;new generation&#8221; of film composers to start winning Academy Awards. He&#8217;s only a few years older than I am. That&#8217;s inspiring to me — it affirms that this generation&#8217;s time is now. We are on the right track, making great choices, and moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>Use these guys as inspiration instead of vilifying them and crucifying them with your opinions. They are working hard at their craft and working towards the same goals that you are. Believe me. They&#8217;ve been where you are and they&#8217;ve seen a way to rise to the next level. Don&#8217;t buy into the old story that it&#8217;s &#8220;all about luck&#8221;. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s about a lot of things — relationships, hard work, persistence, tutelage, experience, and making mistakes&#8230; just to name a few.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marc Shaiman will tell you that one of his best-known scores, for <em>City Slickers</em>, came into this world with more than its fair share of agony.<em> </em>One of the toughest parts to write was the famous cattle-rustling scene—Shaiman says he was scared out of his mind by the temp track. He felt like &#8220;the ghost of Copland was standing over [his] shoulder.&#8221; It&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve all faced. Not from Copland, and not always from the temp track, but there&#8217;s a sort of intimidation that hits us once we&#8217;ve landed a really good gig.</p>
<p>Once in a while a project lands here at the Gulag that makes me sit up and take notice. Sure, I do my best work every time out, just like you all do, but you know what I mean. Some gigs just get under your skin. There&#8217;s something there that makes you want to knock it out of the park… show the world what you can do… get off your rear end and write the Great American Film Score.</p>
<p>All of which is usually followed by a sudden feeling of creative nausea. Musical constipation. Call it what you will—lots of people have called it lots of things, usually invoking some sort of unsavory gastrointestinal metaphor.</p>
<p>Instead of writing music, you&#8217;re <em>thinking</em> about writing music. You&#8217;re competing against some hypothetical &#8220;perfect score&#8221; (whatever that beast would sound like), instead of simply doing what you do. In other words, you&#8217;re making parts of the process conscious, even <em>self-conscious</em>, that ought to be subconscious. It&#8217;s a fast track to an unhappy ending.</p>
<p>And yet we&#8217;ve all been there. If you haven&#8217;t, kudos… but your moment will come.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how Shaiman handled it: he got out of his own way. He sat down at his piano and mentally let go of the whole cue for a little while. He played through a bunch of tunes he knew well, and knew he knew how to <em>play</em> well, just for enjoyment and distraction. Just to allow his mind to decompress a bit and regain its footing.</p>
<p>He was jamming along to an up-tempo gospel tune when the tape machine (now *that* dates this story, doesn&#8217;t it?) automatically reached the end of its pause-timer and resumed playing that cattle-rustling scene.</p>
<p>As the story goes, Shaiman looked at the now-unpaused video, and heard the music he was playing on the piano, and the two just… fit. He knew exactly how he was going to score the scene. Copland&#8217;s ghost was banished (either to a Mexican salon or an Appalachian spring, one supposes), and Shaiman got back to work.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t want to end this month of competition with the cliché about your toughest competition being yourself—there are a whole <em>lot</em> of us composers out there now, and some of us are pretty damned good! So that whole thing, Zen as it might be, just isn&#8217;t true.</p>
<p>Except when it is.</p>
<p>Make of all of this what you will… I hope in the weeks and months to come, you&#8217;ll get out there, compete, hustle, and kick down some doors. (and let us know how it goes, OK? We love to hear from you!)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/02/sig-fenoughty1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-719" title="sig-fenoughty" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/02/sig-fenoughty1.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>Pitching for composing jobs is a necessary part of the business. By finding a niche and hanging out your wares, you&#8217;ll effectively reduce your competition from other composers, and by being an excellent chap to work with you&#8217;ll be inundated (!) with repeat business.</p>
<div><em>But there will be times when you just gotta knuckle down and compete to get the gig.</em></p>
<div>I, as a person, am not particularly competitive. Inherently, I&#8217;m more interested in the collaboration side of this job &#8211; I think that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re all at this crazy game, no?</div>
<div>I&#8217;ve somehow managed to get away with competing no more than 4 times for a gig (that I can remember… maybe I blanked the rest of the times out…). Read on to find out how they turned out (save for the most recent &#8211; I&#8217;ll let you know when they get back to me) and what lessons there&#8217;s to be learned.</div>
<div><a name="more"></a></div>
<div>I&#8217;m seriously grateful that in most of my work I&#8217;ve been kept busy with commissions from repeat business and word-of-mouth recommendations. I put this down to <em>finding my niche</em>.</div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><span class="hw" style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">niche</span> <object style="margin: 1px;" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="13" height="21" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><embed style="margin: 1px;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="13" height="21"></embed></object> <span class="pron" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #809e83; cursor: pointer;" onclick="pron_key()" onmouseover="return m_over('Click for pronunciation key')" onmouseout="m_out()">(n<img src="http://img.tfd.com/hm/GIF/ibreve.gif" alt="" align="absbottom" />ch, n<img src="http://img.tfd.com/hm/GIF/emacr.gif" alt="" align="absbottom" />sh)</span></span></p>
<div class="pseg"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><em>n.</em></span></p>
<div class="ds-list" style="margin-left: 1cm;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><strong>1. </strong>A recess in a wall, as for holding a statue or urn.</span></div>
<div class="ds-list" style="margin-left: 1cm;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><strong>2. </strong>A cranny, hollow, or crevice, as in rock.</span></div>
<div class="ds-list" style="margin-left: 1cm;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><strong>3. a. A situation or activity specially suited to a person&#8217;s interests, abilities, or nature: </strong><span class="illustration" style="color: #226699; font-style: italic;"><strong>found her niche in life.</strong></span><strong> </strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><strong>b. A special area of demand for a product or service</strong></span></p>
<div class="sds-list" style="margin-left: 1cm;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><span style="color: #226699;"><em><br />
</em></span></span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"> </span></p>
</div>
<div>Looking back, it wasn&#8217;t a conscious decision, I don&#8217;t think. It just kind of happened while I was focussing on getting any and all composing and sound design work I could possibly find.</div>
<div>I have a composing niche. It&#8217;s orchestral, created with samples and often has a contemporary vibe, somehow. There&#8217;s usually a quirky or dark flavour to it.</div>
<div>Though to be fair, I don&#8217;t think I can call this a niche. It&#8217;s more like 50-90% of the film composers&#8217; style out there&#8230; so that can&#8217;t be it what&#8217;s making me more attractive to clients.</div>
<div>I also have a geographical niche. Even though it&#8217;s the fourth largest city in England, few people have heard of Sheffield, my base in the UK. There&#8217;s a grassroots film and a reasonably successful television industry in the region… but there are so few composers here, I really have cleaned up.</div>
<div>I suppose I might consider that I have a personality niche. I&#8217;m uber-reliable, never miss a deadline (to date!), unusually objective towards my creations&#8230; sometimes it&#8217;s a rare quality in this line of work.</div>
<div>I do rather wonder if being a female composer has helped rather than hindered my career &#8211; maybe there&#8217;s an element of novelty value there?</div>
<div>So, back to pitching. The first time I pitched for a gig, it was an unpaid feature. I was fresh out of postgrad college and needed to get a credit and some showreel fodder urgently. I beat 40 other composers, wuh yeah! … but I think I had an unfair advantage at that level, and it was pretty much a done deal that I&#8217;d win. It was unpaid, and a student film too. I figured after the fact that not many composers with my experience, training and skill would probably go for a gig like that.</div>
<div>Moral of the tale &#8211; shoot low.</div>
<div>My god, that&#8217;s awful advice, that can&#8217;t be right.</div>
<div>Perhaps rather it should be… be better than the competition! But what does &#8216;better&#8217; mean. Let us know your thoughts in the Comments below.</div>
<div>The second time I pitched, I didn&#8217;t get the gig. There were two other composers in the running, and the best man won, to be fair. The pitch was very specific and precise, and I twisted it a little to suit my style, skills and gear. I had a few redrafts too after feedback, which meant I got closer to the desired product, a luxury not usually afforded to pitching composers. I think I was treated better since I&#8217;d worked with the director before and he was in my corner!</div>
<div>When I heard the music on the show though, I realised why I didn&#8217;t get the gig. They wanted Tibetan vocals and ethnic instruments with a very, intimate, human edge, and I&#8217;d given them music better suited to epic panoramas on a nature show. Oops.</div>
<div>At the time, I was pretty gutted &#8211; I&#8217;d assumed that since they&#8217;d come to me first and that the director wanted to work with me again that it was a done deal.</div>
<div>Trust me, it&#8217;s <em>never</em> a done deal &#8217;til the fat lady sings.</div>
<div>Morals of the tale:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>If the client has been very specific, really do follow that brief, to the letter. If they&#8217;ve come to you with the offer to pitch, they obviously know your stuff already. No need to do more of the same. Be as accurate as you can.</li>
<li>Never assume you&#8217;ve got the gig simply because you have an awesome working relationship with the director/producer/editor/music supervisor. He&#8217;s not the only one who has the final say…</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t take it personally. Rejection is par for the course in this line of work. It&#8217;s not personal, it&#8217;s not that you&#8217;re a bad person, it&#8217;s (hopefully) not that your music is dire. It just wasn&#8217;t right, and someone else got closer to that bullseye. Find out what the finished music was like, learn what it was that they meant by their brief, get over it and move on to the next job. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>The third time I pitched, I have to be honest… my heart wasn&#8217;t really in it. It was not a passion project, but rather a friend&#8217;s film, co-produced with a big-name channel, destined for broadcast &#8211; and so had the promise of back-end royalties. My heart became less in it when I got 3 very different briefs over the course of 6 weeks with various revisions going back and forth. By the end, I was still putting in the effort, but the love for the work had gone. Ugh.</div>
<div>Can you guess whether I got the gig? You&#8217;d be right I suspect &#8211; no, I did not win this particular commission.</div>
<div>Did I mind? Surprisingly (or not), no, partly because by this point I had developed that elephant-thick skin that is so important when dealing with criticism and/or rejection. But partly I was also a little relieved. The brief was really tricky to pin down and changed with every new conversation I had… and I took that as a sign of things to come. Also the tracks I wrote were awesome and I&#8217;m now selling them as library tracks. Win-win. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></div>
<div>Moral of the tale:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>When pitching, if the brief is hazy, ill-defined or keeps changing, you better develop some awesome mind-reading skills. Otherwise you have to rely on the gamble of guessing and hoping. This isn&#8217;t to say that you should avoid these gigs if they&#8217;re the only ones available to you at the time. You may get lucky. Just don&#8217;t get too attached to the outcome.</li>
<li>If a brief keeps changing as you pitch, it doesn&#8217;t bode well for the rest of the gig even if you do somehow win the commission.</li>
<li>If it&#8217;s not a passion project, or even a subject matter that interests you vaguely, the other benefits better be good. &#8216;Cos if they&#8217;re not… why are you pitching for it in the first place? There has to be some inspiration for those lines and dots, you know.</li>
<li>The music you wrote should be pretty awesome if you put your all into it. It still belongs to you. Why not flog it through a music library, or offer it to your local filmmaking buddies for non-exclusive licensing, if it&#8217;s appropriate for that sort of project. Sell it on iTunes. Don&#8217;t let it just sit there, put it to work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, as I write this I&#8217;m pitching again. I actually just finished uploading the tracks to the ftp!</p>
</div>
<div>Yikes.</div>
<div>This time the brief is pretty, well, brief. And not really a brief, more a transcription/reduction of an email conversation between the production company and the funding clients, where they decide that they&#8217;d like to compare different styles for the work rather than being very specific. It&#8217;s really very open-ended. But there are some &#8216;style&#8217; tracks that the clients appear to like and also a sample of the video to work to, which gives an idea of where they&#8217;re headed. And the genre of the project is sooooo in an area that I really want to get into, so the love is there.</div>
<div>So this one is a little bit of an experiment. I&#8217;m sticking to the &#8216;vibe&#8217; of the style tracks, but they&#8217;re definitely in my &#8216;niche&#8217; writing style too. I&#8217;m providing lots of variety within those styles, some very contemporary, some more orchestral and cinematic and also there&#8217;ll be tracks that blend the two styles.</div>
<div>If I get the gig, I want to be writing music that I want to write, that I love to write, that will make me jump out of bed in the morning in the knowledge that I&#8217;m scoring a series I&#8217;m excited about.</div>
<div>If I&#8217;m not the right gal for the gig with these tracks, I won&#8217;t be gutted that I didn&#8217;t get the job. I&#8217;ll be happy that I didn&#8217;t get contracted into writing for a project that wasn&#8217;t my cup of tea.</div>
<div>But I really do hope that I am the right gal for the job. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seems like there are a lot of ways to spend your money these days, often more money than may be coming in. What are the right choices to move your career forward? Here are a couple of contrasting ideas, both worth considering in their own context.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">More bits</span><br />
To start with, here I am wearing my &#8220;technical guru&#8221; hat. Let&#8217;s review some things about digital and computer audio; there&#8217;s a new technical trend and product you should be aware of.</p>
<p>You probably know that digital audio, in the files we create and the way in the signals can flow from one piece of equipment to another, can be in a variety of different sample rates (44.1KHz, 48KHz, etc.) and word lengths (usually 24-bit for most professional applications). (If you need a refresher, check my article &#8220;<a href="../../../2009/09/technical-guidelines-for-film-and-tv.html">Technical Guidelines for Film and TV Scoring — Part 1</a>&#8220;.) Recently there has been a lot of talk about &#8220;32-bit&#8221; and &#8220;64-bit&#8221; — how does that fit into all of this?</p>
<p>The new Apple Mac Pro computers with Intel Core2 Duo processors and the newest operating system, 10.6 (Snow Leopard) are said to be 64-bit capable. Do they sound even better? No, not necessarily. 32-bit and 64-bit don&#8217;t have anything to do with digital audio formatting or fidelity. What this is all about is the ability of any individual software app to access on-board RAM memory.</p>
<p>With 32-bit capability, which is how things have been up until now, an app such as our familiar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstations_%28DAW%29">DAW</a> hosts Digital Performer, Logic, etc., can have a current working file size of up to 4 gigabytes. This includes the amount of memory that is needed for plug-in soft synths, many of which are getting to be pretty substantial memory hogs. This would include, but not limited to, such popular products as Omnisphere, Trillian, Ivory, and the various orchestral library sample players. Maybe you&#8217;ve noticed, by the time you get a few of those instantiated, your DAW becomes logy, slower and less responsive, maybe crashy. It&#8217;s not just processor power, it&#8217;s memory handling.</p>
<p>When clients ask me about buying a computer, a common question is how much RAM memory to equip it with? The computers can hold more and more, but if the DAW can only be filled up to 4 GB then the practical guidelines have been maybe 8 GB total. But that&#8217;s not the case anymore; on a new machine I would recommend 16 GB or more — I think very shortly you are going to be able to put that to good use.</p>
<p>In order to run more soft synths, there have been work-arounds that some composers have used. A common and practical one is <a href="http://www.plogue.com/?cat=4">Plogue Bidule</a>. This app runs in the background along with your DAW, talks to it (sound and MIDI) via <a href="http://www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/index.cfm?fuseaction=get_article&amp;article=rewire">ReWire</a>, and can act as host for plug-in soft synths in a variety of formats. The instruments connect to and can be programmed in your DAW software but are not limited by how much memory an individual app can access, at least up to the 4 GB limit. So effectively you can double your capacity, with some soft synths in your DAW and some in Plogue.</p>
<p>But now we are entering the era of 64-bit memory accessing, so this limitation is going to go away. With 64-bit, a processor can address up to 16 exabytes of memory (that&#8217;s over 16 billion gigabytes)! Now the DAWs, sample players, and other apps have to be re-written in order to take advantage of this. Some already have: Logic 9.1 is 64-bit ready, and (some) SpectraSonics synths. Others can be expected to join the party certainly within the next year or so.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there is another &#8220;background&#8221;-type host which looks to be an even better bet than Plogue: <a href="http://vsl.co.at/en/65/71/1738/1356.vsl">Vienna Ensemble Pro</a>. This was built for their excellent Vienna Orchestra sample sets, but can work with other brand plug-ins as well, and the advantage is that it comes with both 32-bit and 64-bit versions — you can run both at the same time, hosting whichever format your individual sample instruments might support. Composer <a href="http://www.joelgoodman.com/">Joel Goodman</a>, recently installed these and reports that his performance with Digital Performer 7.1 has been generally smooth and trouble free (well … we are talking software here!). (Special thanks to Joel who brought me up to speed on this stuff.)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">More people</span><br />
Now let&#8217;s talk about something that will make your music even more exciting than the best software instruments, I promise.</p>
<p>How many of you would be willing to take your entire fee from a gig, maybe even several gigs, and invest it in the newest greatest computer software or hardware upgrade? &#8220;Yeah, I can see that, it keeps getting better and you gotta keep up, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, how many of you would be willing to take that same pile of money and invest it in a room full of expert studio musicians, for one day? Or maybe just a few of them?</p>
<p>Not so easy, is it? &#8220;My clients don&#8217;t really care. There&#8217;s no budget for it, or time. I&#8217;m barely making ends meet as it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve observed something from my engineer&#8217;s chair: Everybody&#8217;s got about the same computer tools, and you need them of course. But the typical one-man band-in-a-box score is a pretty good way to get more of the same kind of work you already have, but not necessarily to move a career forward.</p>
<p>A couple of examples come to mind: most people are familiar with the composer Michael Giacchino. A couple of years ago at the SCL annual meeting, he told the story of his big break, when he insisted on using a live orchestra to score a video game. Now of course that&#8217;s not uncommon — thank you Michael! I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll ever reach for Omnisphere when he wants to pull someone&#8217;s heartstrings.</p>
<p>Or, closer to my home: composer <a href="http://www.miriamcutler.com/">Miriam Cutler</a>, whose documentary scores always feature as many live warm human beings playing instruments as she can possibly squeeze in. Often they are recorded one at a time, in her personal studio, and sometimes layered with electronic textures as well, but the net effect is an organic and emotional sound that keeps her in demand in her chosen genre. I know she&#8217;ll agree that insisting on live musicians is a big part of what gives her music the magic that clients notice.</p>
<p>Think about it: when you add even one more expert player to your mix, you are doubling the intellectual and creative firepower. And in a city like Los Angeles, there is an incredible wealth of experienced players who have &#8220;been there and done that&#8221; over and over. They bring not only the ability to play a part in tune and expressively, but help solve dramatic problems, improvise in just the right way for the emotion of a scene, or give an immediate sonic spark that you&#8217;d never get out of East-West Quantum Leap even if you worked all night.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not in Southern California (or just want to stay off the freeway), ask me and I can refer you to amazing musicians with personal studios and high-speed Internet who can work with you anywhere in the world — guitarists in every style from metal to ethnic world sounds, woodwinds and brass players, harp, bass, a pianist with an amazing Bösendorfer piano, some percussionists, fiddle and other strings, kick-ass drummers, even a pretty good mixing engineer <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . All with experience in major motion picture and television scores.</p>
<p>I have to admit, I&#8217;m not a composer and I don&#8217;t write the checks. Maybe yet another episode of a reality series is not the time to suddenly splurge on a bunch of live guys (although check out &#8220;Lost&#8221;); if so then what about the next big pitch demo? You will have to find the right time and place, but I strongly believe it&#8217;s worthwhile.</p>
<p>What do you think? I&#8217;d be very interested to have composers weigh in with comments about when and if you have worked with expert live players (no matter where you are located), and what your experience was.</p>
<p>Who is your secret weapon (don&#8217;t worry we won&#8217;t tell), player or players that you couldn&#8217;t do a score without? Did you ever try live musicians and then regret it? Did you ever work with a musician who gave you fantastic results that you never would have expected? Did you learn something? Did your clients (or demo targets) care, or notice? Did you get the gig? Would you do it again?</p>

Where we might do better to unclench a bit. Go with the flow. Let it come to us, rather than launching ourselves at it all gung-ho and crazy-eyed.<br />
What I found, after the jump.<br />
<a name="more"></a><br />
<strong>First off,</strong> I find a lot of composers these days (particularly composers who are just getting started) with their fingers on the trigger of the <em>spam cannon.</em> They&#8217;re just blasting away, firing off demo packages to anyone and everyone who might have an active e-mail account. Filmmakers? Sure. They get demos… but so do music library companies, music supervisors, music editors, studio/network execs, and anyone else whose Hollywood Creative Directory listing seems to touch even marginally on the subject of organized sound waves. There&#8217;s often little or no follow-through involved—it&#8217;s all about hitting the maximum number of targets <em>once</em>. That, to them, constitutes being a tough, aggressive competitor. But that&#8217;s not just being overly competitive; it&#8217;s also competing in the wrong thing.</p>
<p>I receive plenty of these e-mails myself; usually it&#8217;s from well-intentioned folks who really want to get a foot in a door (mine). The truth of the matter is this: If I don&#8217;t know you, I&#8217;m not going to hire you. And getting to know someone, in my opinion, takes a little time. If the only correspondence we&#8217;ve had is the one e-mail you sent with links to your website and your work—and if that e-mail ends with something like &#8220;please give me a call or an e-mail so that we can discuss how much money you&#8217;ll be paying me,&#8221; you&#8217;re pretty much hosed before you even got started. It&#8217;s a turn-off. You&#8217;re making me feel like I&#8217;m just a sub-boss monster in the video game of your life. And you&#8217;re gonna blast me with your spam cannon and get onto the next level. I&#8217;m not that easy… and neither are most filmmakers.</p>
<p>I like meeting new people, especially music people, and even more especially music people who are <em>on fire</em> to get their careers going. But a little unclenching in this particular department works wonders. Building relationships takes time… at its best, it happens organically. And trying to force those relationships—looking at them too much like they&#8217;re something to be shooting your way through, rather than nurturing and enjoying—is, to my way of thinking, over-competitive.</p>
<p><strong>Next up: gear.</strong> We&#8217;ve talked about GAS (Gear Acquisition Syndrome) around here before, and I freely admit to succumbing from time to time. What I sometimes find, though, is film music pros snapping up a whole new array of toys merely out of a desire to race in the Gear Derby. Again, it&#8217;s competing in the wrong event.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not suggesting that it&#8217;s not important to stay up on the latest stuff; it definitely is. But it&#8217;s a means to an end. And there&#8217;s a pacing to the thing: it ought to be at a level commensurate with the gigs you&#8217;re actually getting (and if you simply <em>must</em> compare and compete, do so with those peers who are at your own level).</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to have a brand spanking new Euphonix or SSL console; who wouldn&#8217;t? But I don&#8217;t need it. It&#8217;s way out of profile with where I am in my career. And the fact that (insert A-lister here) just bought one, or five, or whatever, shouldn&#8217;t really bear on my decision. If I let it, I&#8217;m allowing my urge to compete over my head put the rest of my finances in jeopardy. And that&#8217;s dumb. I don&#8217;t need any more machinery to legitimize what I do.</p>
<p>My take on this: put the blinders on, run your own race, and unclench. When you need gear, get the best you can afford and no more. (it&#8217;s enough to have to spend just doing that!)</p>
<p><strong>Last thought for now: </strong>There are all sorts of aspects of this biz in which thinking of the struggle as a competition can be healthy. It spurs us on to do more than we might be inclined to otherwise. It takes us out of the safe, familiar zone where no growth occurs. It gives us definitive, often-humbling feedback about how we&#8217;re progressing.</p>
<p>But competing over who can go the longest without sleeping, or who has neglected their family and friends the longest, or even who can write the craziest number of minutes of music in a day? Somewhere in there is that oft-mentioned line between hard-ass and dumb-ass. Tread carefully. Run the right race. Don&#8217;t let your hardcore composer status become an end unto itself.</p>
<p>Lurkers—here&#8217;s a great chance to pitch in your own thoughts. I&#8217;d love to hear what you think on this one. What have I missed? Are there other areas where we&#8217;re all guilty of getting too amped-up, <em>too</em> competitive? Hit the COMMENTS below and let me know what you think.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/02/sig-sanders.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-509" title="sig-sanders" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/02/sig-sanders.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>So… your demo is standing tall. Your people skills are honed, crisp and extra-sparkly. You&#8217;ve targeted a few level-appropriate projects, and maybe one or two &#8220;long-shot&#8221; gigs, just to start getting higher-ups familiar with your work. Your phone calls are getting returned, and the gatekeepers seem ready to say the magic word—<strong>yes</strong>.</p>
<p>Then, one by one, those gigs just… slip away. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory">Black swans</a> start cropping up in your work life—unforeseen interlopers that threaten to swoop in and snatch the fruits of victory out of your hands.</p>
<p>What—and who—are these <strong>unexpected competitors</strong>? Knowing about them—and how to compete with them—should be an integral part of your game plan. So let&#8217;s take a look, after the jump.<br />
<a name="more"></a><br />
<strong>1. The Budget Composer.</strong><br />
This person&#8217;s a vulture—preying on productions whose budgets are tight. He swoops in fast and lowballs everyone else off the table. Sure, it&#8217;s no way to earn a living in the long-term. Budget Composer is hoping to cement a relationship with the filmmakers, though, so that he&#8217;ll be a lock for the next gig (and, through some sort of magical process, the filmmakers will decide he&#8217;s worth a lot more money next time around).</p>
<p>Two problems with this approach: first, &#8220;lowball&#8221; has come to mean <em>zero</em>. And it takes real creativity to get below that (of course, some composers are now striking deals to give away their royalties, in effect literally paying for the privilege of writing music).</p>
<p>Second, chasing an expanded music budget on the next gig is like chasing the horizon. It&#8217;s out there, tantalizing you but never coming within reach. Take it from me. It&#8217;s not going to happen. Not if you do a standout job with the budget you have. Think of it like a producer: Why would you pay more for the same product—especially when the person providing that product desperately <em>needs</em> the gig?</p>
<p>I think the best tactic against Budget Composer is to take the high line. Know what you cost. Don&#8217;t deviate from it. And if you do deviate from it, make it clear up front that the filmmakers are getting a x score (where x is the rate you&#8217;ve chosen for yourself) for y dollars (where y is the amount you&#8217;re agreeing to), and that this special one-time offer won&#8217;t be repeated. You will lose gigs this way, but my take on it is that they&#8217;re predatory gigs to begin with. If &#8220;low cost&#8221; is the sole criterion (or even the #1 criterion) for choosing a composer, then you have to wonder about the filmmakers&#8217; priorities elsewhere in the show. And you have to ask yourself if you want to spend the rest of your career on your knees, begging for every extra penny.</p>
<p>By the way, if this gig is for someone with whom you have an existing track record—i.e, if they already know your rate and have paid it in the past—you might be wise to take any offer of this sort to be a relationship-threatening insult. Unless everyone on board is taking a hit just to do the project (and the filmmakers are taking a bigger hit than anyone else!)… and even then I&#8217;d advise you to be wary.</p>
<p>If your standing (social <em>and</em> professional) with the filmmakers is solid, though, I still claim that you&#8217;ll have some general protection because of the rule that states: people generally don&#8217;t screw over their friends. Sure, it happens… but less often than you think. Keep those relationships right and tight, and you&#8217;ll find out for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Music Supervisor.</strong><br />
When the position of music supervisor was first imagined, it pertained almost exclusively to the domain of <em>songs</em> in films. Now music supervisors have begun to assert jurisdiction over the score-selection process as well. In addition to presenting a &#8220;short list&#8221; of songs and/or artists to be considered for placement in a film or television project, they often recommend one or more composers for the gig. And their recommendations, increasingly, are carrying weight. Not just with individual filmmakers, but with networks and studios as well. The model is evolving: in a growing number of cases your demo will have to go through a music supervisor before it&#8217;s even mentioned to any other gatekeepers.</p>
<p>This additional middleman can save the filmmakers an immense amount of time—and never more so than in today&#8217;s composer-saturated environment. We&#8217;ve talked before about the hundreds—literally hundreds—of demos that land on the desks of filmmakers for each and every gig. Giving all those demos legitimate consideration really is a full-time job.</p>
<p>Of course, if you have a pre-existing relationship with those other gatekeepers, you can communicate with them directly, regardless of whether a music supervisor is in the picture. And if you&#8217;re friendly with the music supervisor, you may find yourself with a powerful ally in the competition to land a gig. You might even get a call out of the blue from a music supervisor, letting you know he or she is recommending you for a job!</p>
<p>So, while this additional layer of &#8216;triage&#8217; does nudge composers a little further from the heart of the creative team, it also presents opportunities for you to enlist other Industry professionals as your evangelists. It&#8217;s all in making those connections.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Music Library House.</strong><br />
If you&#8217;re writing any sort of library music, this is your dilemma. The production companies that make these shows are less and less inclined to speak with individual composers. It&#8217;s just too much of a hassle to pick up a few dozen cues here and there. They simply don&#8217;t have the time… or the budget to pay someone to hassle with the phone calls and e-mails and downloads and paperwork.</p>
<p>Reality shows today deal more and more frequently with massive music library corporations, who can &#8216;represent&#8217; tens of thousands of tracks. The task of &#8220;filling out&#8221; the music for a show becomes a one-stop shopping kind of event—a single phone call from a line producer to a music library sales rep (though they typically give themselves a more high-flung title, that&#8217;s really what they are) can make it happen.</p>
<p>So if you want to compete in the music library biz under your own banner (i.e., not writing for an existing library company or composer), the bare minimum number of cues you&#8217;d better have ready to go is 500. Fewer than that, and no one (producers <em>or</em> music library execs) will consider you worth the trouble of doing the paperwork. Even better is 1,000 cues. At 1,000 cues, across a wide variety of styles and emotions, you could conceivably go directly to a reality show or production company and promote your own library. Your mileage may vary, but in my experience that&#8217;s where it seems to be shaking out these days.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have that many cues just lying around (!), one option is to get into business with an existing outfit. There are many of them out there, and (like music supervisors, above) they&#8217;ve pretty much sewed up the market for this type of gig. You&#8217;ll be one or two steps removed from actually meeting filmmakers or seeing picture… and you&#8217;ll be giving up a sizeable portion of the income on the cues you create… and the pay up front is small, if any… but you will be writing music that actually stands a chance of getting placed in a show. You&#8217;ll be aligning yourself with a company that already has established contacts, in a business where contacts are the coin of the realm. It may sound like I&#8217;m slamming the notion, but I&#8217;m really not—you just have to have a plan for moving beyond this stage of your career, if moving beyond it is what you want to do (for many people it isn&#8217;t!). Otherwise that old chestnut about a career opportunity turning into a career trap could be the story of your life. Proceed with caution.</p>
<p><strong>4. The Temp Track.</strong><br />
Here&#8217;s one where you can actually gain ground, if you&#8217;re willing to admit that there&#8217;s no rule prohibiting composers from befriending music editors and sneaking their own scores into the temp. It&#8217;s actually the rule rather than the exception… and another reason why LA-based composers have a colossal edge. Befriending music editors brings cool people into your social circle. It makes interesting work-conversations more likely. And it makes it possible for your music to become the &#8216;default position&#8217; early in the show&#8217;s post-production process. Let some other composer fall prey to an unexpected competitor… you!</p>
<p>At a bare minimum you can ask your music editor friend what&#8217;s being temped into a project they&#8217;re working on. Then you can demo in a style that is similar. Or, if you&#8217;re convinced the approach is wrong, you can work against the grain and submit something completely different, armed with the knowledge that what you&#8217;re sending will be a fresh approach. (crazy as this may sound, I heard of a situation very much like this only a couple of weeks ago. Of a dozen short-list composers who sent in demos, the one who went completely against the brief from the filmmakers landed the gig. But you have to be damned sure you&#8217;re right to try this!)</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not &#8220;on the temp,&#8221; and you haven&#8217;t the first clue what scores the music editor is using, you will find it much harder to write music that&#8217;s in the ballpark of what the filmmakers and execs are expecting to hear. You&#8217;re writing in the dark, using your psychic abilities to divine the intent of the production. That&#8217;s a tough proposition.</p>
<p><strong>5. The Producer&#8217;s Girlfriend&#8217;s Cousin&#8217;s College Roommate.</strong><br />
Unlike the temp track, here you basically have no wiggle room. You get blown out because of a pre-existing relationship (however tenuous or unmerited) that someone leverages to get on a show. The only thing I&#8217;d mention here is that sometimes the composer at the other end of this ridiculous broken-line connection is actually good. And you have to admire the networking skill required to pull off something like this. Don&#8217;t hate the game… don&#8217;t even hate the player. As with the temp track, the secret here is: don&#8217;t assume a rule exists just because a tactic is personally distasteful to you.</p>
<p><strong>6. The Old Flame.</strong><br />
No, I&#8217;m not talking (exclusively) about ex-romantic partners. I&#8217;m thinking more about a situation like Burton and Elfman, reuniting after Howard Shore stepped in for Ed Wood. Or Cameron and Horner. Or any number of other teams that break up and come back together… sometimes precisely at the moment you think you&#8217;re a lock for the gig! Ouch. It&#8217;s a tough one to take (believe me—I&#8217;ve experienced it), and yet there&#8217;s something to be said for loyalty. Even if that loyalty is sporadic.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not much else to say here… if you get edged out by an Old Flame, there&#8217;s little to be done. My advice: wish them the best, then silently hope for another breakup (and your opportunity to introduce the filmmaker to the joys of a lower-drama creative relationship).</p>
<p>One thing I&#8217;m noticing about all these unexpected competitors is that there&#8217;s a social aspect to nearly all of them. Which underlines the social-interaction portion of our job even more clearly. I&#8217;ll end by making it simple: Being a competent writer is crucial. Being a brilliant writer helps. But the better you are at the social aspect of the game, the more success you&#8217;ll meet with in your career. Whichever of the two you are.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/02/sig-ogden2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-508" title="sig-ogden" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/02/sig-ogden2.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>I cherish &#8220;verbal economy&#8221;. Getting to the bottom of something — to the core level of it — while utilizing the smallest amount of verbiage possible is something that I am profoundly fascinated with. It drives me crazy when someone is trying to make a point, and instead of stating the main crux of their position, they wax on with twenty minutes of preamble.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ll try my damnedest to make this intro quick and to the point.</p>
<p>I am supposed to talk to you today about &#8220;competition&#8221;, but I don&#8217;t want to, so I&#8217;m not going to. Instead, let&#8217;s talk about what the very core of the word &#8220;competition&#8221; boils down to: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>winning and losing</em></span>. And there&#8217;s a lot to talk about.<br />
<a name="more"></a><br />
Here&#8217;s the deal: Right this very second, as you sit wherever you are and read this post, one of two things is taking place in your life. You are either <em><strong>winning</strong></em> the game of being a successful working film composer, or you are <strong><em>losing</em></strong> it. It really IS that simple.</p>
<p>It is easy to lose at this gig. It doesn&#8217;t take much. If you are haughty enough to think you can simply make it on talent alone, you are losing already. Mark my words: Your disciplines, not your ability to put dots on a page, will be what determine whether you win or lose in this crowded film composing landscape. If you have the wherewithal to really dig into what makes a winner and what it takes to win consistently&#8230; you are well on your way to making a serious run at this thing.</p>
<p>If you know me personally or have spent any amount of time reading what I write here at SCO, you already know that I personally do not subscribe much to the &#8220;luck&#8221; speech you hear from most successful film composers. Sure, fortune plays a part, but I rather believe that it is a steady stream of hard-carved winning disciplines that moves a person closer to the place where fortune can smile upon them. To me, winning is not about being the best at the moment. Winning is about being the best over time.</p>
<p>Think about it this way: NBA legend Michael Jordan is a winner. But to Jordan, winning is clearly a life choice. Much like putting on his pants everyday or taking a shower. You just do it, but you do it through a combined effort of several &#8220;habits&#8221; that work together to birth the perfect long-term win. Over time, we&#8217;ve all come to view Michael Jordan as someone who just simply does not lose easily. And occasionally when he does lose, he goes back to basics and gets serious about those fundamental habits that will propel him toward his next victory.</p>
<p>With that said, let me share several disciplines that I consistently examine and re-examine of myself in order to insure that I am winning, and not losing, at this incredibly competitive game we call &#8220;Composing for Film and Television&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>DISCIPLINE #1: PURPOSE</strong><br />
<em>What is it that you like doing? If you don’t like it, get out of it, because you’ll be lousy at it. You don’t have to stay with a job for the rest of your life, because if you don’t like it you’ll never be successful in it. — Lee Iacocca</em></p>
<p>The day that you even have a fleeting thought that you aren&#8217;t having fun composing anymore is the day it&#8217;s time to get out.</p>
<p>For several of us, composing for film and TV is non-negotiable. We HAVE to do it. It is, as they say, in our blood. I am a musician at heart, but I do not get the sense of fulfillment by playing drums, piano, or violin the way that I do when I write music to picture. There is nothing that makes me feel quite like the act of writing score does. It is not something I can explain; it is not something I can define. It simply &#8220;is so&#8221;.</p>
<p>You might be passionate about other things in life that bring you joy in a way that scoring films cannot. If so, please take my word for it: You need to quit pursuing film music as a possible career choice. Game over. You&#8217;ve lost already. I don&#8217;t say this out of anything other than the fact that everyone should be happy and fulfilled in life, and believe me, doing something you are not 1000% charged up about won&#8217;t ever bring you that joy and fulfillment you are looking for. In fact it will create the opposite, with a little &#8220;wasted time&#8221; added in for good measure.</p>
<p>It is with this kind of supreme confidence that I start every day of my life. I was MEANT FOR THIS. There is nothing else BUT this. No matter how hard it gets, how crowded the market gets, how poor the economy gets, how miserable the industry becomes&#8230; no matter. I am here, I am a film composer&#8230; I WILL achieve and I WILL be victorious. I have no &#8220;Plan B&#8221;. I have no safety net. I have no choice. THIS is my career purpose.</p>
<p>Another part of this has to do with the strength of your &#8220;drive&#8221;. I know a person who wants to break into the entertainment industry, but at every opportunity, at every turn, he excuses himself from meeting socially with directors, producers, and executives, always with the reason of being &#8220;too tired from work&#8221;. Guess what? That&#8217;s a losing mentality, and it&#8217;s guys like me who cannot wait for people like him to say things like that so that I can come in, full of purpose, ideas, and solutions, and save the day.</p>
<p>The bottom line is you either mean to be here, or you don&#8217;t. There is no middle ground. There can&#8217;t be. It&#8217;s too competitive. There are winners and losers in this, and winners are here out of necessity. Losers are here temporarily.</p>
<p><strong>DISCIPLINE #2: ORIGINALITY</strong><br />
<em>I am not looking like Armani today and somebody else tomorrow. I look like Ralph Lauren. And my goal is to constantly move in fashion and move in style without giving up what I am. — Ralph Lauren</em></p>
<p>Nobody is looking for a clone of a new fad. They might think that will work, but if a person is presented with two choices, one being a carbon copy of the latest and greatest and the second a fresh, powerful, revolutionary idea, they will always choose the latter. This is a tested principle that has held true throughout the history of the world.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>People desire to be first.</em></span></p>
<p>This goes for studio executives, also. I know you&#8217;ve heard the horror stories of composers being &#8220;forced&#8221; to rewrite the temp. But consider the possibility of a studio exec, under pressure from stockholders to keep things riding high, realizing half way through the scoring dates that their composer simply is not in the creative space to deliver a fresh idea like they hoped he would. Imagine the internal feeling of compromise that must be reached for a studio boss to come to the place of allowing that composer, because of basic financial and schedule economics, to just do what they &#8220;know will work&#8221;, and call it good.</p>
<p>This is NOT the fault of the studio executive. Sorry. You don&#8217;t get off that easy. No. This is the fault of the composer. It is OUR job to bring a fresh musical voice to every production. It is OUR job to create something, through the careful balance of tradition and forethought, that will support the picture in way that has never been heard before.</p>
<p>When you shortcut your creativity in the interest of time, finances, or for any other reason, you lose.<br />
<strong>DISCIPLINE #3: ORGANIZATION</strong><br />
<em>The object of this competition is not to be mean to the losers but to find a winner. The process makes you mean because you get frustrated. Kids turn up unrehearsed, wearing the wrong clothes, singing out of tune and you can either say, &#8220;Good job&#8221; and patronize them or tell them the truth, and sometimes the truth is perceived as mean. — Simon Cowell</em></p>
<p>Our industry is complex. As a film composer, the deck is already stacked against you from the moment your feet hit your bedroom floor everyday. Why then, would you ever poke the bear by not doing things that are elementary to the success of any business venture? I&#8217;m talking about things like not having materials ready; not remembering names; not researching meeting participants, etc.</p>
<p>All of these things are things that I have nailed down when I go into a meeting. I operate under the assumption that I&#8217;m up against the most rehearsed, prepared, organized person out there. THAT &#8220;superhuman&#8221; is my #1 threat. I will know every name associated with the project, every movie that each producer has worked on, each composer that the director has used before, the styles of the films that these people have completed in the past, and what kinds of stories this team likes to tell. Am I surprised every so often with something I didn&#8217;t anticipate? Of course. But I am so prepared that you&#8217;d never know it.</p>
<p>Imagine trying to beat The Terminator in a fist fight. No matter what you do, you are screwed, because through repetition and carefully calculated methodology, he is simply engineered to be better, stronger, and able to take more abuse than you ever could.</p>
<p>That is who you are up against. I hope you are ready.</p>
<p><strong>DISCIPLINE #4: DECISIVENESS</strong><br />
<em>Remember, a real decision is measured by the fact that you&#8217;ve taken new action. If there&#8217;s no action, you haven&#8217;t truly decided. — Anthony Robbins</em></p>
<p>If SCOREcast&#8217;s Lee Sanders has said it once, he&#8217;s said it a million times: <em>We are hired for our opinions</em>. And he&#8217;s right. Nobody cares about your music if you, as the composer, do not have a statement about why you did it that way. Sitting quietly in the corner, afraid to utter a word or join in the conversation is a career killer, and you really need to get over it.</p>
<p>In this town, people who are decision makers for THEIR companies have no time or tolerance for whiny little kiss-asses who are afraid to make a move one way or another for fear of screwing up. Even if it&#8217;s the wrong one, people would rather you just move at all.</p>
<p>I have zero trouble making large, key, career decisions. In fact, I have an easier time making a decision that will effect a multi-million dollar budget than I do deciding what shirt I am going to wear each morning. Your directors and producers are going to be counting on your ability to make key decisions under pressure. Work now to develop the habit of deciding. Do not allow the paranoia of making a mistake keep you from making decisions.</p>
<p>Also, make decisions quickly. Not hastily, but quickly. There is a difference. I don&#8217;t rush decisions — I think things through completely. Sometimes you have to &#8220;hurry up&#8221; and decide, but usually, there is zero need to do that. In fact, in most cases, the need for a rushed decision is merely poor planning on someone else&#8217;s part cloaked in urgency. Don&#8217;t fall prey to that. Car salesmen hate me with a passion because I don&#8217;t buy into their &#8220;the sky is falling unless you buy today&#8221; rhetoric. At the same time, I never over-analyze anything to the point of indecision. Operating like that cripples your ability to complete tasks. Being afraid of making the wrong decision can cripple your ability to be a leader in your field.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my next point&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>DISCIPLINE #5: LEADERSHIP</strong><br />
<em>Outstanding leaders go out of their way to boost the self-esteem of their personnel. If people believe in themselves, it&#8217;s amazing what they can accomplish. — Sam Walton</em></p>
<p>If you still think this is a solo career, you have been living in a very dark cave and it&#8217;s time to move. If there ever was an example of a career where strong leadership skills are becoming more and more crucial, it is that of the film and television composer.</p>
<p>However, it has always been taught that leadership is only an attribute of those who are at the top of the power pyramid. I would argue, instead, that a more modern paradigm of leadership could be a phenomenon that is so far-reaching that it also brings along those who are in higher positions of power than that of whom is doing the leading. I&#8217;ve been involved in countless organizations where the person who was elected the leader is obviously not the person who is in charge. In fact, sometimes, it is hard to know who to follow because on one side of the room you have the person who is the &#8220;designated&#8221; leader, but over here you have someone else whom everyone seems to want to follow. And of course, the person everyone is following IS the true leader.</p>
<p>I say all of this to say that if your leadership skills are strong, it is possible to lead in such a manner that those who are in positions of power way out of your paygrade will follow you also. Good leadership is a party people want to attend. It got our current President elected, and it is the reason why Donald Trump is where he is today. You might not agree with Obama&#8217;s politics, and you might think Trump needs to &#8220;fire&#8221; his hairdresser, but you cannot deny either man&#8217;s ability to get people charged up about something, so much so that they execute at an optimum level.</p>
<p>Leadership contains several key disciplines in and of itself. One of those disciplines is the ability to share credit, which is where I believe most composers start losing integrity. A lot of composers don&#8217;t like to share. And why should they? It&#8217;s hard out here for a pimp! We work long hours, for mediocre pay, with no guarantee of future gainful employment. We should get credit for every ounce of sweat equity that goes into our music, right?</p>
<p>But, we also know (and have discussed earlier) that film music has become a team sport, of sorts. No longer, except in the rare indie occurrence, does there still exist the film schedule that allows one enough time to go it alone. There are no Lone Rangers in film scoring. In all likeliness, you&#8217;ll have a team of people behind you that are pulling their weight in an effort that you might actually make that deadline on time and under budget. That team is brilliant, and more times than not, they&#8217;ll save your proverbial ass. You owe them more than just a paycheck. You owe them gratitude, you owe them public recognition for a job well done. Ultimately, you owe them a better gig somewhere else when the time is right.</p>
<p>Being a leader is about empowering others for THEIR sake, not yours. It is a selfless way of life. It is a giving, not a taking. Consequently, you may feel you are not in a place to lead just yet. I disagree. Leading isn&#8217;t circumstantial. It is elective. You either are leading, or you are following. Again, make up your mind which way you want to go, and go there. Just don&#8217;t expect people to follow you anywhere if you aren&#8217;t leading them somewhere.</p>
<p>Leadership is something that you might have to learn as time goes by. Some people are born with inherent leadership qualities, while others become time-tested leaders over a long period of years. Whatever the case, leadership always stars with one thing: Superior attitude.</p>
<p><strong>DISCIPLINE #6: ATTITUDE</strong><br />
<em>It is your attitude, not your aptitude, that determines your altitude. — Zig Ziglar</em></p>
<p>Your attitude is probably the most important distinguishing weapon in your competitive arsenal. It is the indicator by which you either decide to keep circling the track, or pull over for a pit stop of reassessment. I don&#8217;t want to give you the impression that I am some Superman who never gets discouraged and always has a smile on my face. That isn&#8217;t the case. Like everyone, I have my times in the desert and I go to THAT place of feeling like nothing is going right. But&#8230; it doesn&#8217;t last long.</p>
<p>My closest friends have heard me say &#8220;I took a dark day, but I&#8217;m back now!&#8221;, meaning that I allowed a single day to cry over my misfortunes, but keeping Discipline #1 in mind —  <em>this is what I do, no matter what</em> — it is a new day and I&#8217;m ready to climb back up on the horse again.</p>
<p>You cannot let obstacles and the trials of the world keep you down for more than a few hours. Yes — take time to realize the situation and personalize whatever lesson you need to learn out of it, but then&#8230; move on. In this particular case, all of the familiar cliches apply: There&#8217;s no use crying over spilled milk; It&#8217;s all water under the bridge; What done is done&#8230; blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>When you get knocked down, catch your breath, sleep on it, wake up, and start kicking ass again. And hey, if you don&#8217;t know where to start, find the nearest ass and start kicking! It&#8217;s not rocket science. There is always something to do. Better yet, if you are out of it from a knock down, write some music. If you are truly pursuing this career (there we are back to that Discipline #1 again!), then there is no better way to get back into a solid routine then to write.</p>
<p>It is only when you give permission to outside influences to hinder your goals that you begin to believe that you are not going to be able to continue. It is all about what you give way to. Part of me maintaining a winning attitude is surrounding myself with others winners. Aside from family, I have two sets of people in my life: Friends and pals. Pals are people that I know, maybe I see them from time to time around town at functions, in social situations.</p>
<p>Friends, though&#8230; those are the people in my inner circle. The people that I believe in and they believe in me. The Friends circle is a limited crew &#8211; Lee Sanders is one of those people. So is my manager and SCO&#8217;s David Fluhr. All of them winners. People who are making things happen and do not allow their lives to fall as it might. I&#8217;ve been careful to cultivate this group and to not allow those that do not belong into the fold. And let me be clear — it&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t spend time with people outside of that circle — I do. But I also have a select group of people that I consider my &#8220;Board of Directors&#8221; — the people that I know I could trust with my life — and they are the ones that I spend the majority of my time with. In these people, I see traits and characteristics that I long to improve upon in my own life, and by watching and learning from them, I can gain insights into how I might go about that.</p>
<p>Using these folks&#8217; attitudes and opinions toward my own tough issues is what helps me keep my attitude in check. All of these people also strive to keep their attitudes positive, and believe me&#8230;. misery loves company! If you surround yourself with other positive attitudes, yours will stay high for longer periods of time, too<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>DISCIPLINE #7: ADAPTABILITY</strong><br />
<em>It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change. — Charles Darwin</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve officially grown tired of hearing about &#8220;how much better things were thirty years ago&#8221;.</p>
<p>Who cares? I couldn&#8217;t tell ya. But I can and will tell you who doesn&#8217;t give a damn: <em>Directors and producers</em>. You know&#8230; the ones who sign the checks!</p>
<p>As composers, by now we are all very aware of how easy it has become for almost anybody to acquire some gear and create a film score that is good enough by today&#8217;s standards. All it takes is a little bit of musical knowledge, a sliver of filmic understanding, a hard drive of loops, and a laptop, and you can basically fashion one together. It might not be great and it might not win any awards, but it will work in a lot of the stuff that&#8217;s going to DVD today.</p>
<p>That, my friends, is the state of our industry. There is nothing to be done that will change that. In fact, it will get worse with time. As with all things in a technological field (which, by the way, film music has fallen under ever since the very first day that someone decided to mechanically sync it to film), the process by which film music is created will continue to be dumbed down, based on the understanding of traditional practices.</p>
<p>I believe it is important to stop here and note that I didn&#8217;t say that &#8220;film music&#8221; will be dumbed down. Only the manner by which we create it.</p>
<p>This means that unless you are willing to embrace where film music creation might be headed, you are going to experience a slow and irrelevant extinction, just like celluloid and magnetic tape is experiencing right now. It is those who embrace the future of film music creation that will ultimately make it through to the next round of film music success. You can long for the old &#8220;Golden Days&#8221; of film scoring all you want, but they are NEVER coming back. It doesn&#8217;t matter what we do — stronger education, less composers in the field, better rates, smarter royalty collection systems — none of these things will ever stop the inevitable force of progress that essentially is eroding the way this gig used to get done.</p>
<p>You need to decide right here and now if you are going to be a forward-thinker&#8230; or a nostalgic crybaby. One will get you to the next level and one won&#8217;t. If you take a look at most people who live winning lives, you&#8217;ll notice that they embrace change, in all parts of life. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it is at home, work, the gym, the finances, the power structure, government&#8230; whatever. The point is that things are always in constant flux&#8230; if you don&#8217;t flex with them, you will eventually become obsolete and be left behind.</p>
<p>Composers are no different. For us, all it takes is a look around at the composers who were able to make the leap from analog to digital. There are a number of composers who were simply unable or unwilling to adapt to the newer methods of digital recording from about 1984 to 1993, and consequently, they are either no longer scoring the modern motion picture or their creative output over the last decade has significantly tapered as a result.</p>
<p>If you are a &#8220;wisher&#8221;, figure out why. And then stop it. You cannot maneuver forward while constantly looking backward. Glance toward the past every now and again to avoid repeating mistakes, but keep your eyes trained on the road ahead. Technology, techniques, methods, and the competition will always move forward — with or without you. The choice is yours.</p>
<p><strong>DISCIPLINE #8: LEGACY</strong><br />
<em>If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader. — Dolly Parton</em></p>
<p>My former assistant, SCO&#8217;s Jai Meghan, has worked with some of the best composers in Hollywood. When he came to me in 2007, the first thing I asked him was &#8220;Why in the hell are you here?&#8221; He had been at Zimmer&#8217;s, worked with Graeme Revell and Harry Gregson-Williams, and learned from some of the best in this business. I couldn&#8217;t understand how he ended up on my door from all of those other places of employment. As we worked together over the two years that followed, I came to realize that although Jai had learned a lot from those guys, for him, that time was over. Now he wanted to know how Deane Ogden did it. And while I don&#8217;t believe I wield any magic wand for doing this gig, there definitely IS a method to my madness. And the method is all mine.</p>
<p>When I leave this planet, I want to be remembered only as a man who left film music better than I found it. If I can improve upon the craft, even in the slightest, I&#8217;ll be satisfied. I don&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;ll invent some undiscovered mode or unlock a never before heard scale or progression, but I simply mean that I want to be a composer who utilized my knowledge of film and music in a way never before imagined by anyone else.</p>
<p>This might be controversial to say, but I&#8217;ve never thought of the Beatles as a group that invented anything new, rather than revolutionizing something that had been around awhile. Elvis Presley didn&#8217;t come up with anything unheard of, he simply polished it up and bundled it in a form that was fresh and relevant for a generation that craved it&#8217;s own musical identity.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all we can do as film composers. The greats of our craft that have gone before us have done all of the magic that can ever be done with a baton. It is now up to us — the new generation — to pick up where they left off and conceive of fresh and unexplored approaches to the traditional devices of film music.</p>
<p>To me, these things are what REAL competition is all about. To me, competing isn&#8217;t about who&#8217;s better or who gets the gig. It&#8217;s about what you do with the gig once you DO get it. What do you print to disk when all is said and done.</p>
<p>Are you a strong decision maker? Are you able to make changes on the fly? Are you a hungrier entrepreneur? Are you an empowering leader?</p>
<p>These are the things that will separate you from the pack. These practices will be the ones that shape your &#8220;competitive spirit&#8221; in the fight for gigs.</p>
<p>Stack us all up against each other, and we are pretty much musically interchangeable.</p>
<p>But stack us up in these areas of competitive discipline, and one of us will ultimately come out the victor.</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s it gonna be? Let the REAL competition begin!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/02/sig-sanders3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-567" title="sig-sanders" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/02/sig-sanders3.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>This weekend&#8217;s question—just putting it out there for some discussion, so hit those comments:<br />
<strong>What if you don&#8217;t like competition?</strong> What if it turns you off, or gives you ulcers, or wrecks your sleep schedule? How do you reconcile that with this career?<br />
<a name="more"></a>First off, I&#8217;m guessing most of you are comfortable taking chances. This career comes with high risk and <em>zero</em> promise of reward. So the fact that you&#8217;re interested in composing at all is a pretty reliable sign that you&#8217;re aware of the gamble. People who are risk-takers generally enjoy tough competition, as well. Generally… but not always.</p>
<p>Risk and competition are different. Competition implies effort. A lottery ticket is a risk, not a competition—there&#8217;s nothing you can do, besides buying more tickets, to improve your chances of hitting the right combination of numbers. Whereas, if you fail to land a gig, there&#8217;s always a nagging guilt, or doubt, that remains: What could I be doing better? Why didn&#8217;t they like me? Why do I have to do this &#8216;schmoozing and hustling&#8217; part—why can&#8217;t writing incredible be enough?</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s column is all about these <em>inner-game </em>aspects of the career. It&#8217;s all about improving what&#8217;s between our ears, rather than what&#8217;s coming out of our speakers. It&#8217;s a subject I want to tackle even more here on SCOREcast, if you&#8217;re interested. So let me know.</p>
<p>For now, here&#8217;s an orientation: some basic techniques for getting through the competitive aspects of the biz, even (especially) if you find them distasteful.</p>
<p>First, <strong>discipline</strong> yourself to a positive attitude. Being dejected and cynical is easy. Finding reasons to stay in the game, and to keep a smile on your face as you do it, is much tougher. It is, in fact, a job unto itself. It requires discipline—one of the great unsung commodities of the age we&#8217;re in. I think discipline is a finite quantity, with each of us possessing a certain intrinsic maximum capacity that is expressed to a greater or lesser extent depending on how we prioritize its usage and constant development. Just like building muscle at the gym, in other words.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only a theory, but it seems to line up with my experience, and I definitely feel the burn when I&#8217;ve had to force a little more discipline onto <em>myself</em> from time to time (usually around deadlines!).</p>
<p>Second, <strong>expose</strong> yourself to competitive experiences more frequently… and not just in film music. Desensitize yourself through increased exposure, a little at a time. So that un-returned phone call didn&#8217;t make you feel so great? Make ten more… twenty more. Once you realize that any one failure, any one defeat, isn&#8217;t the end of the road, you should (should!) be able to breathe a little easier next time.</p>
<p>Third, <strong>study</strong> resources that are proven for other competitive environments. There are books, websites, DVDs that use the same fundamental mental-toughness techniques that top trainers preach day in and day out to the peak-performers in every human endeavor. This technology has actually been developed to a fairly astonishing level—take advantage, be skeptical as required when confronted with some of the ridiculous claims that are out there, and find what works for you. Make a proactive effort to improve, just like you do when you sit down to compose. Work at it.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>unclench</strong>. Accept that there may, in fact, be aspects of this career that aren&#8217;t your favorite thing in the world. Put in perspective, though, they&#8217;re actually relatively minor when you compare them to the fact that, even at a middling level of success, millions of people around the world will be hearing the music you create. You&#8217;re taking your place as one of the people who shapes the artistic reality of the present moment. That&#8217;s a pretty spectacular reward, and it&#8217;s one you shouldn&#8217;t just blow past in some sort of rush to whine about having to get out there and hustle.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From time to time it&#8217;s the case that I first meet a filmmaker in the context of trying to land their picture—as opposed to having met them in some other capacity beforehand (and thus already knowing them when it&#8217;s time to talk about their latest project). I&#8217;m reminded what a bad scenario the former case is. Far, far better to have some social interaction prior to that meeting in which you have to sell yourself.</p>
<p>Either way, though, one thing I recommend avoiding at all costs is <strong>talking too much</strong>. I was up for a small picture a few years ago, and had to take a &#8220;cold&#8221; meeting with a pair of producers (I was already friends with the director). The meeting was incredibly tense and awkward… and all the more so because the producers completely stonewalled me.</p>
<p>They <em>literally</em> said, like, six or seven words the entire 30-minute meeting. That kind of thing doesn&#8217;t just happen… it&#8217;s premeditated. But that didn&#8217;t occur to me then.</p>
<p>As the silent seconds thundered past… as the director stared in my direction with a hangdog look that told me he wasn&#8217;t gonna bail me out of this mess, all I could think of was: &#8220;What magical combination of words out of my mouth will cause these people to like me?&#8221;</p>
<p>I tried to fill the empty air with something, anything—opinions on their script, ideas of how my score would enhance the narrative, a preliminary concept for a palette—but it just got more awkward as they declined to respond. Again and again and again. Finally I was dismissed with a simple &#8220;thanks&#8221; (yes, I&#8217;m counting that as one of the six words they said!) and a nod toward the door. I&#8217;ve shown more respect to moldy, back-of-the-fridge lasagna before chucking it in the trash can.</p>
<p>It was one of the most humiliating professional interactions I&#8217;d ever had. It took me days to recover. If I&#8217;d been able to meet these people socially beforehand, at the very least I would have seen that dynamic in action ahead of time. I could have bowed out of the whole situation gracefully.</p>
<p>Could I have come out with a win? Was there some Jedi sequence of moves that would bring the picture my way? Almost certainly not. In this case, there was no hope for me (see below). <em>V</em><em>erbal economy</em> is a best practice regardless, and sometimes it&#8217;s your only hope of retaining your dignity.</p>
<p>But I hadn&#8217;t gotten that memo. I just yapped my trap <em>ad nauseam</em>, hoping something would evoke a positive reaction. The better play would have been to let the silence fall, or simply to ask a couple of questions and <em>then</em> let the silence fall. Either way, I would have been demonstrating that I was comfortable without words… which would have put the pressure right back on them to say something. Then, if they chose to continue to disrespect me, I could keep control of my part of the equation by walking out without another word. Ending the meeting on my terms, and in a definitive, positive, fashion. That&#8217;s the strategy I recommend to you should you ever come across this particular brand of negotiator.</p>
<p>It turned out that the pair of producers in this little nightmare anecdote were in the midst of an all-out creative war with the director, so I was never gonna get that gig. Still, the way those producers wrung me out, just to make a point <em>to the director</em> about who was wearing the pants on the production, was asinine. And, after the sting of the insult faded, it was instructive. Now I know what to do when I find myself in one of those rooms (and I imagine you&#8217;re devising your own clever strategy right about now, too… which is sort of the point).<br />
In happier meetings, being concise and focused is still important. It means that the words you do say carry more weight. They allow you to get to the point more quickly. This is a technique I have to work hard to keep at the top of my own mind—I have to be vigilant against my natural tendency toward wordiness. Especially if it&#8217;s a gig I really want, my tendency is to try to seize control of the situation with words… words… words.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a bad idea, kids. For all kinds of reasons. Over-talking (and its first cousin, &#8220;always having to have the last word in a conversation&#8221;) is indicative of weakness, of a lack of self-control, of a feeling that the gig in question is <em>needed</em> rather than <em>wanted</em>.</p>
<p>Which leads me to this: <em><strong>no</strong></em> one gig should be everything to you. If it is, you lose any leverage you might ever have in your relationship with the filmmakers. You want to be affable, communicative, intuitive and responsible… but your self-respect demands that you stand up when it&#8217;s time to walk out of the room. Hopefully the gigs that you land will all be honeymoons, but don&#8217;t be afraid to use silence every once in a while to protect your turf. And don&#8217;t be afraid to take your toys and go home if your would-be collaborators are <em>truly</em> abusive.</p>
<p>There are times when it&#8217;s not worth getting the gig… and other times when the most useful thing you can do is act for all the world like you don&#8217;t want it. It&#8217;s amazing how much respect you can command when you prove you&#8217;re willing to stare someone down, or even to walk—not out of anger, pettiness or spite, but simply as a matter of self-respect.</p>

Not unless you consider hard work, lots of rejection, or a healthy bent toward self-determination a &#8220;magic bullet&#8221;. Is there an easy way in? The answer, as with most things in life, is &#8220;no&#8221;. Most things that are worth doing don&#8217;t come easy. However, there are many tried and true methods as well as some proven principles that most of us here at SCO can safely say we&#8217;ve built our working careers on. While there would never been enough room to list them all, here are ten things that I&#8217;ve learned about getting a foothold and gaining some traction as a composer for film and television.<br />
<strong> <a name="more"></a></strong></p>
<p><strong> 1. Find a niche</strong> &#8211; style? medium? geography? &#8211; differentiate yourself. Embrace your unique qualities. What can you offer that no-one else can? Why on earth should they pick you for the gig?</p>
<div>Whilst it is a good idea to keep on top of the popular styles that are being asked for (the obvious ones that spring to mind are the Newman, Zimmer, Elfman schools of music) what is it that makes your style unique and special?</div>
<div>Got some crazy mad skills on the thumb piano or theremin? Build up your sound from that to give you an edge.</div>
<div>I&#8217;d have to say that one of my defining niches would be my geographical location. I&#8217;m not based in any of the conventional media centres (LA, NY, London) but despite the obvious inconveniences, it does have the added bonus of meaning competition for local composition work is minimal. And my overheads are way lower so more of my profits can go into the business and my quality of life, meaning my work gets better.</div>
<div>That&#8217;s not to say that had I been based in one of these aforementioned media cities I wouldn&#8217;t have made it into the business, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d be at a very different stage right now. Could have been better, or could have been much worse!<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Get over yourself</strong>. Think about it &#8211; put yourself in the mindset of a director. Who would you want to work with to create the music to your latest masterpiece film? The guy with an ego the size of Alaska, delusions of grandeur, who bangs on and on about themselves and how awesome their music is or how no-one can possibly understand the torment of their genius&#8230; or the chap that will really listen to what you have to say, feels the same passion as you for your project and has a sense of humour to boot?</p>
<div>
<div>Headshots with you in your shades looking deadly serious in moody black and white may not be the kind of image you want to project. Whilst I&#8217;ve no doubt you&#8217;re an awesome composer, there&#8217;ll always be someone better (but with the same reasoning, there are plenty of people who are worse, chin up!). Projecting an image of quietly confident professionalism and approachability will get you much further with media clientele.</div>
<div>Offer to demo for free. Go above and beyond the call of duty. If they just don&#8217;t like it though, this is a prime opportunity to develop a thick skin and remain objective… don&#8217;t take it personally when you don&#8217;t get the gig. Learn your lesson and move on to the next assault. There&#8217;s plenty more fish in the sea.</div>
<div>In fact, this happened to me only this last week &#8211; the executives for a feature I had pencilled in to score later in the year decided they wanted classical Indian music score rather than my line of tunage. The director was very apologetic. But even though it&#8217;s a bit of a bump in the road, I don&#8217;t mind. It&#8217;s happened before and I know it might happen again. The same way I know I&#8217;m still going to have the busiest year workwise on the most exciting projects I&#8217;ve done yet. How am I so sure? Because I&#8217;m going to make it happen (by following these tips <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ).<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Get Networking</strong> &#8211; <em>It&#8217;s not who you know, it&#8217;s what you know</em>. Going to a networking event? Prep your elevator pitch. You will most definitely be asked what you do, so get it summed up short and sweet. This is tricky and it really is worth rehearsing this in advance. You&#8217;ve got thirty seconds tops before the person opposite will get bored and zone out.</p>
<div>
<div>Then shut up and listen <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Be approachable. Friendly. Smile! Ask questions, see if you can make connections, introduce and match-make, rather than constantly banging on about yourself, your music, your latest piece of gear (unless of course they ask! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ). If you make a great contact, follow up after the event with an email or phone call. If you made no obvious contacts, don&#8217;t worry, sometimes these things are a slow burn and the chap you gave your business card to at the bar may know someone who needs your services down the line&#8230;</div>
<div>(Oh, and wear something red or brightly coloured. You&#8217;ll get remembered.)</div>
<div>Need to find networking opportunities? Google your town or city for production meetups/networking events, or if you&#8217;re in the UK your local film council office will probably run them or at least have relevant information for you.</div>
<div>Online networking opportunities are becoming more and more viable by the day. Get into Twitter to see if you like the format (hey, I got this awesome ScoreCast gig through Twitter!), and online forums may lead you to newbie director who may become the next big thing.</div>
<div><em><br />
</em></div>
<div><em>All of which should be leading you to…</em><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Cultivate relationships</span></p>
</div>
<div><em> &#8211; with decision makers</em> &#8211; directors, producers, execs<br />
<em> &#8211; with the troops</em> &#8211; editors, animators, post-production supervisors, assistants, runners<br />
<em> &#8211; with everyone and everyone</em>, you never know who in your family or circle of friends knows someone who knows someone…</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em>Every conversation is an opportunity <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></em><strong> </strong></p>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>5. Broaden your horizons</strong> &#8211; short films, indie projects, computer games, music libraries, wedding videos… Get creative with options, do some detective work on what&#8217;s in production locally or nationally. Google is your best friend to start this search. Get digging. Once you&#8217;ve found your dream job that&#8217;s currently in production&#8230;<strong> </strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>6. Be precise with your marketing</strong> &#8211; tailor your showreel and/or pitch package to the project you&#8217;re going after. The horror film director couldn&#8217;t care less about the romantic comedy short you just scored, no matter how lush the string samples. Get specific.<strong> </strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>7. Have an online portfolio or presence</strong>, either your own site or hosted on any of the many and varied dedicated sites for this, with music and clips, a list of credits &#8211; always drawing attention to the best ones! You haven&#8217;t got any credits? Put up your music samples then work for free on student films to get showreel fodder, and it&#8217;s good experience. Attach a blog to your site, have opinions, share your knowledge. You never know who&#8217;s reading.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">8. Don&#8217;t give up your day job just yet… </span>You gotta pay for the roof over your head, and (more importantly) your studio <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . Plus your music&#8217;ll really stink if you&#8217;re starving cos can&#8217;t afford to eat. You get my drift. You&#8217;ll know when you&#8217;re ready to take the plunge, when the income from composing overtakes the rest of your revenue streams. &#8216;Til that point, stay focussed on your dream but keep your feet planted squarely on the ground. Don&#8217;t be an idiot.<strong> </strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>9. Don&#8217;t give up your dreams, </strong>if they are what you truly desire. Where there&#8217;s a will, there&#8217;s a way, and the one thing that differentiates those that compose for a living from the others that will never make the grade is, simply, persistence.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">The singlemost important tip I could possibly give you is to keep the unwavering faith and vision of the goal that drives your passion &#8211; to make this crazy business of media music a way of life.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Be persistent, but not pushy. There&#8217;s a fine line and you only Eternal Optimism is the greatest weapon in your arsenal (that and the latest string sample set from EWQL, of course).<strong> </strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>10. I know I said there&#8217;d be ten tips</strong>&#8230; but here&#8217;s YOUR opportunity fellow SCOREcasters &#8211; share the love around!  Insert your own gems of advice from your own experience in the COMMENTS below!</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve had this experience: you go to a party, a meeting or seminar, or maybe just an informal gathering of people — friends, work colleagues, folks out in the world. Inevitably there is one person there who stands out, the center of attention, clearly the most confident, smartest, most successful. How did this person get to be that way? Blessed with talent, charisma, and brains, they go through life winning every game they play&#8230; it seems.</p>
<p>If you are one of those people, congratulations. But what about the rest of us? How can we hope to compete and succeed in their world, maybe even become a bit like that someday? Let&#8217;s take a look at a few charismatic successful people I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of meeting and working with over the years, and then talk a bit about what we can learn from them.</p>
<p>The first composer I ever worked with in major network TV show scores was Stewart Levin (30-Something, Picket Fences). Before moving into composing, he played keyboards for Dionne Warwick and other entertainers, and so is comfortable around &#8220;stars&#8221;. Besides being a terrific musician and composer, I was always impressed with how at ease he seemed to be with show producers Ed Zwick, Marshall Herscowitz, and David Kelly — besides music and film, he could talk with them about other things they were interested in, hobbies, families, cars, and so forth. He&#8217;s a charmer who always has a joke to tell to break the ice.</p>
<p>Nelson Kole is a bundle of talent, energy, and fun. Is it his New York roots that make his mind go faster than most people I know? He has had music bursting out of him since an early age, particularly in the world of musical theater; he tells of organizing his high school plays as arranger and music director, and this past year he arranged and coached a dance number for Beyoncé and Hugh Jackman in the Academy Awards telecast. One can learn a lot from watching the way he works with a performer, making sure everything is perfect for their individual abilities — song key, range and pacing, and attention to what they can do best and what they might need help with, always with a smile.</p>
<p>Dan Foliart is one of the most experienced and successful television composers (Secret Life of the American Teenager, Home Improvement, the list goes on and on). Much has been written about his shows and scores, but I&#8217;d like to mention his dedication to being a leader and mentor for composers. As president of the Society of Composers and Lyricists, he has done much to defend the art and business of score music, to shine a light on successful composers and encourage up-and-coming ones, and to provide a sense of community in what is often a solitary profession. In a crowd people gather around him, but he always generously takes the opportunity to introduce folks to each other, and say something positive about each one.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth mentioning the <a href="http://www.thescl.com/site/scl/">Society of Composers and Lyricists</a> with a bit more attention. If you are in the Los Angeles or New York area, I can&#8217;t recommend this organization highly enough. It&#8217;s a resource for composers, lyricists, as well as support professionals such as orchestrators, instrumentalists, mixers and engineers such as myself, even agents and attorneys. Will being a member get you a composing job? Maybe not directly (although perhaps as an assistant), but frequent seminar meetings have included topics such as getting the job, working with directors, musicians, engineers, editors, and software, and even effective networking techniques.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, one more name worth mentioning is Dan Kimpel. I met Dan in an SCL seminar on networking. He is absolutely a powerhouse expert in all things &#8220;getting the gig&#8221; through effective interaction with all kinds of folks who can help move your career forward. He is a guy who is absolutely overflowing with a million terrific techniques and ideas on how to get yourself noticed in this business in a positive way.</p>
<p>Dan Kimpel has written an excellent book on the subject, which is a &#8220;must read&#8221; for all: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Networking-Strategies-Music-Business-Book/dp/1592007538/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1264028744&amp;sr=1-5">Networking Strategies for the New Music Business</a> (You may have noticed, I think books are important.) He tells, with far more authority and detail than I could, the right (and wrong) ways to hone the connection skills that are so important in this business.</p>
<p>What can we learn from these bright guys? Clearly it&#8217;s important to perfect your chops as a musician, but social skills and interaction play a big part as well. Being at ease around other people comes naturally to some; for others of us it takes practice. One key tip I have learned is that &#8220;to be interesting to others, you must be interested in others&#8221;. Stewart, Nelson, and both Dans have in common that they are truly interested in and engaged by the people they come in contact with. You can tell they have a passion for what they are doing, and the people they are doing it with.</p>
<p>You might say, &#8220;Self-confidence comes easy for those who are successful. But what if I&#8217;m not yet at that point?&#8221; But almost everybody has had success in at least something. You don&#8217;t start out the climb at the top of the mountain. Think about what you have learned so far, and of course never stop looking for more ways to learn, grow, and practice.</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t forget, find a way to be a bright light to at least someone in the world. You probably already are.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/01/sig-ogden.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-510" title="sig-ogden" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/01/sig-ogden.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>I have dinner every couple of months with a great group of working television composers. Part strategic network, part support group, our times together are always amazing and I&#8217;ve never not come away with either some juicy info on a cool new compositional technique or a great new way to implement some sort of hardware or software tool. Composers often get pegged for some of our antisocial behavior, but when these 20 or so composers get together, the discussion and conversation flow can be endless, and these social gatherings often drag into the wee hours of the next morning.</p>
<p>At the latest of these dinners this last weekend, I became engaged in a conversation about this month&#8217;s topic of &#8220;Getting the Gig&#8221;. It seems several of my composer pals are also heavy-duty SCOREcast readers and have been chomping at the bit to take me to task on some of our opined viewpoints on the subject.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>As I listened intently to their complaints about the 1) over-saturated composing market, and 2) the downward spiral of the quality of film music today, I realized something about our theme of the month; Something that, quite possibly, could be a flaw in how we presented it this month; Something I never thought about, oddly, until I was sitting there listening to my composer friends struggle through what should have been a simple conversation about a very simple subject.</p>
<p>I realized this:</p>
<p><em><strong>The &#8220;gigs&#8221; don&#8217;t exist.</strong><br />
</em></p>
<p>Now, stay with me here&#8230; because, as usual, I don&#8217;t mean that in the way that everyone else likes to mean it lately. I&#8217;m still an optimist. I don&#8217;t believe that others can control my destiny, and I do not, for a single minute, believe that the world or the universe dictates what you are capable of with your skill set, your intellect, and your willingness to dig in hard and achieve. I refuse the popular notion that our industry — our craft and profession — is going to hell-in-a-handbasket, the sky is falling, and the world as we know it is coming to an end. (And dammit if Hans Zimmer and his merry band of monkeys aren&#8217;t to blame!)</p>
<p>So, with that&#8230; here is what I mean&#8230;</p>
<p>As composers, we are always searching for our next film gig. I know in my own career I get nervous as hell when I&#8217;m wrapping up a show and I don&#8217;t have the next one lined up and ready to jump right into. For me, there is no greater stress than wondering where the next thing is going to come from, and my preference is always to have &#8220;one to show and one to go&#8221;, as they say.</p>
<p>But honestly, &#8220;gigs&#8221;, as we&#8217;ve all come to know them, do not exist anymore.</p>
<p>Now, there are &#8220;gigs&#8221; as in webisodes, short films, student thesis projects, commercials, or industrials&#8230;. those types of gigs. Some of them are healthy to take on and some of them are almost a &#8220;pay-to-play&#8221; situation, in which you&#8217;ll have to decide on your own if they are healthy for you or not. But, with the rise of technology in film scoring, yes&#8230; it <em>is</em> easy for just about anybody to edit together a great score from loops, samples, and other digital assets that have helped to shape industry trends over the last ten years.</p>
<p>Any of us, if we are being honest at all, have to understand that &#8220;looped music&#8221; has become as much an aesthetic as custom score has always become over the last hundred years. Whether we like it or not, there is a certain group of filmmakers who are &#8220;just fine&#8221; with a score edited together from loops and samples, and they will take it for some or <em>no</em> money (if we are being real) in trade for the promise of backend money (if we are feeling lucky). That last sentence contained a lot of &#8220;ifs&#8221;, didn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>&#8220;Gigs&#8221; — if we still define them as <em>&#8220;jobs where we get to compose music the old fashioned way, and then get to realize that music through the recording of live instrumentation&#8221;</em> — are a very rare gift only given when a certain type of filmmaker recognizes the value that such a process lends to the overall quality of their project.</p>
<p>Therefore, I want to inject a new phrase into the vernacular — something that is both true and accurate, and alive and well in our craft, yet, also overlooked and maybe undervalued.</p>
<p><em>The gigs don&#8217;t exist. But the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">people</span> do.</em></p>
<p>There are <em>people</em> out there who value the hell out of a finely written and recorded original score — <em>people</em> that were brought up, much like you and I were, to listen for the emotions and nuances that well-crafted musical material can bring to the cinematic experience.</p>
<p>Instead of looking for gigs, we need to be looking for those <em>people</em>. We need to stop looking for gigs as &#8220;potential jobs&#8221;, and start treating <em>people</em> as &#8220;potential partners&#8221;.</p>
<p><em>People</em>, in ANY arena in life, are what matter. I&#8217;ve been lucky in my career to make lifelong friends out of most of my clients. In fact, I can think of only one person that I&#8217;ve worked for that I don&#8217;t speak to regularly either through emails or by telephone — only one director that I don&#8217;t see socially at least once a year.</p>
<p>That is because &#8220;gigs&#8221;, in the way that we all like to think of them, are essentially worthless. But relationships&#8230; Ahhhh! They are absolutely worth every minute you spend cultivating them.</p>
<p>Ask Williams where he thinks he would be without Spielberg. Ottman without Singer. Burwell without Coens. Zimmer without Bruckheimer.</p>
<p>Relationships are key, and they should not be regarded as casual, disposable assets — especially in favor of singular &#8220;gigs&#8221;. Gigs are static events: they happen, and then they are over. But people&#8230; people are perpetual <em>organisms</em>, and in our case, organisms of the creative kind. What do we know of creativity? We know, because of our own <em>composer</em> relationship with it, that it never rests. It is a an evolving, continuously germinating, living, breathing animal that never rests and is never satisfied. People, then, are essentially a &#8220;fountain of youth&#8221; for creative flow and opportunity, whereas &#8220;gigs&#8221; are simply <em>gotten</em>&#8230; and subsequently, <em>forgotten</em>.</p>
<p>Before I start sounding too much like Jerry Maguire, let me present a qualifier for what I am suggesting: Should you adopt this philosophy that I am proposing, you have to do it with a genuine heart. You cannot &#8220;love people&#8221; because you &#8220;love what they might give you&#8221;. Pardon the expression, but that is a bullshit way to be. That is &#8220;false&#8221; in every sense, cheap in every way, and deceit at it&#8217;s ugliest manifestation. We&#8217;ve all experienced the feeling of only being valued because of what we can provide the other person. It is a gross feeling, and one that leaves you used and abused on a number of levels. No. It as to come from a genuine place.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: If you cannot it within yourself to value those you desire to work with as people and not as objects that can provide you with sustenance, you are in the wrong place and you will never be truly successful. Mark my words. You will never attain a place of respect and honor in this small community we all work in and you will never become the composer you want to be, at the level you want to be composing at. Karma, as it is said, is a beotch!</p>
<p>There will be those who read this and say that, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have to like everyone I work with.&#8221; That&#8217;s right, you don&#8217;t. Even I don&#8217;t like everyone I&#8217;ve ever worked with, either. But I still value them as people who knew <em>what</em> they wanted, <em>when</em> they wanted it, and trusted <em>ME</em> to deliver it to them. That is a big responsibility and one that can never be taken as lightly as just saying, &#8220;Yeah&#8230; that was a pretty good <em>gig</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Think about the gigs you&#8217;ve enjoyed the most in your career. Were they fun because the music was easy but the people were jerks? Or were they fun because the people were a blast and the challenge was difficult? I&#8217;m betting on the latter.</p>
<p>Forget &#8220;gigs&#8221;. Gigs are going to be great, and gigs are going to suck. Gigs will come, and gigs will go. Gigs will work out, and entire scores will be thrown out. Such is the terrain of the composing journey. It is what it is.</p>
<p>The thing you DO have control over is how you seek out and treat the people that you will work with. Sometimes&#8230; and I&#8217;ve said this before&#8230; but sometimes people will place more value on how good of a hang you are than they will how great your music is. In fact, that happens a lot in this game. Learn to understand and &#8220;be&#8221; with that, rather than &#8220;being&#8221; with the thought that you &#8220;just need a good film to write for&#8221;.</p>
<p>What we all really need is strong cinematic partners that have the same goals and aspirations as we do. Believe me, they are out there. I have several. I love them all. I cherish them first as people, secondly as friends, thirdly as collaborators.</p>
<p>The gigs really don&#8217;t exist. But the people <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>really</em></span> do.</p>

You&#8217;d like it to be, but you just don&#8217;t land enough gigs (yet). In fact, you&#8217;re not even sure how to get yourself into the pool of available candidates for enough gigs, often enough, to make it a full-time profession. Read on for some ideas and a little perspective.<br />
<a name="more"></a><strong> </strong><br />
<strong> </strong><br />
<strong> </strong><br />
<strong> </strong><br />
<strong> </strong><br />
<strong> </strong><br />
<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<div style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">First off, some ideas. </span></div>
<div style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">One day you&#8217;re toiling away, cheerfully losing money and hustling your ass off… constantly looking for ways to &#8220;plus the show&#8221; of your own musical endeavors while working a separate job (or two or three) to pay the bills. It&#8217;s taking a toll on your energy level, but you&#8217;re passionate. You&#8217;re committed.</span></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Before too terribly long, you see a tiny little payoff (beyond the endless chain of freebies and low-paying gigs that have so far seemed to be your lot in life as a composer). Someone finally says yes, and you&#8217;re one of the few people in town with a paying gig. You do that for a while… you&#8217;re diligent about follow-through, you&#8217;re a &#8220;good hang,&#8221; and your music gets the job done… and then some.</span></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Eventually some of the people on that gig move on to other productions and spread the good word, and one day the phone rings and you get another gig. Then you&#8217;re one of the even </span></span><em><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">fewer</span></span></em><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> people in town with multiple gigs. You throw a massive party to celebrate. Maybe you wake up the next morning a little hung over and incredulous that this thing is actually starting to happen.</span></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">You leverage your new position in the community by publicizing and taking meetings, getting to know the gatekeepers in the creative and executive ranks, being a real person, and suddenly you&#8217;re &#8220;hireable&#8221; for the next level of gig. You miss a few opportunities, land a few which underperform, and then one day your small studio picture breaks through.</span></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Now you&#8217;re a hot commodity. You&#8217;re worried about becoming a &#8220;flavor of the month,&#8221; but purely in terms of getting the gig, the equation has turned around. People are now calling you, wanting that unique thing you bring to the table.</span></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">(*sigh* I love a happy ending! Even though the story is actually just starting to get interesting.)</span></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">So what&#8217;s the takeaway here? What are the underlying principles that you can apply to make this </span></span><em><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">your</span></span></em><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> story—even if the little details will inevitably be different?</span></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 19.0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br />
</span> </span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></div>
<div style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">1. Treat it like a full-time job, even when it&#8217;s not.</span><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> In other words, fake it till you make it. I&#8217;ve written about this before: If you&#8217;re not earning a living at this (and you&#8217;d like to), you actually have </span></span><em><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">two or more</span></span></em><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> jobs. One of them just doesn&#8217;t pay any money (yet). Does this sound like fun to you? (hint: it&#8217;s not.) Expect long hours, little sleep and a sizable outlay of funds to get yourself to the place where you might actually be considered for a paying gig.</span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">…and expect to do lots of freebies. Ask Deane some time about student films… starting out, they were a full-time, non-paying career for him. Eventually that career began to pay dividends. Same for me. In fact, the subject of &#8220;paying dues&#8221; deserves its own heading…</span></span><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 19.0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><strong><span style="font-family: inherit;">2. Pay your dues.</span></strong><span style="font-family: inherit;"> <span style="font-weight: normal;">Your career &#8220;breaks&#8221; will usually come on the coattails of, or by a referral from, someone you&#8217;ve helped out on a smaller project. The rewards of landing even a single successful gig are so disproportionate (after all, you&#8217;re doing exactly the same thing you did dozens, hundreds of times before, for little or no reward!) that making a long-term plan that only comes to fruition over a course of years can be a smart move.</span></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">In fact, it is essentially the only move available to you, if you&#8217;re looking (eventually) to score Big Studio Pictures. That is a rarefied terrace (more on the &#8220;terrace effect&#8221; below) that is only approached by a few people. If you&#8217;re not already in a certain position, you have zero chance of being considered. Zero.</span></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The good news: the lower the rung, the more different ways in which it can be approached. As you move higher, you find that there are fewer and fewer ways by which you can approach landing a gig. Which is natural: the more money someone&#8217;s paying for a product, the more picky and cautious they become.</span></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 19.0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><strong><span style="font-family: inherit;">3. Make friends with people who can hire you.</span></strong><span style="font-family: inherit;"> <span style="font-weight: normal;">This one, by the way, goes a long way toward alleviating the woes of budget, deadline and collaboration. People are much more likely to hire people they know. People are much less likely to take advantage of people they know.</span></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">By the way, filmmakers and composers are naturally inclined to be friends. We both care intensely about storytelling… we both have knowledge of the same body of art… we both swim in the same social and geographic pool. We both have to manage creative teams. And we both understand the strange dichotomy of &#8220;interacting socially and politically with the world&#8221; vs. &#8220;sitting in an isolated computer cage for hours on end&#8221; that is necessary to do what we do.</span></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">So don&#8217;t be intimidated out of seizing an opportunity. Think in advance about some things you&#8217;d like to talk about with filmmakers you admire. Develop some opinions about what turns you on (and off, too, I suppose, though I tend to try to stay positive!) about movies, TV, etc. Do your homework. Then, when the opportunity presents itself, simply introduce yourself and start talking. If it&#8217;s a bad time you&#8217;ll know it, if you have any social graces at all… but usually people love to talk about what they do.</span></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Get over the slightly uncomfortable feeling of talking to strangers—assign yourself the task of &#8220;befriending&#8221; five complete strangers a day for a week. In a shopping mall, grocery store, wherever. If you can hone your &#8220;gift of gab&#8221; to the point that you actually have cool things to say—and are careful to </span></span><em><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">listen</span></span></em><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> even more than you </span></span><em><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">talk</span></span></em><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">!—you&#8217;ll find it easy and fun to engage in conversations with all kinds of creative pros… and they&#8217;ll find you equally fascinating.</span></span></div>

Learn to express it passionately but concisely, and without veering into the strange and frightening territory of musical geek-speak. Read every interview you can find with the A-listers: they all have an unerring way of talking simply about what it is they do, while at the same time revealing their personality as human beings. Unless you&#8217;re a very rare sort of person, this takes practice! So practice with a willing friend, colleague, lover or other sympathetic soul. Keep at it. Record yourself. You may be shocked to hear all the &#8220;um&#8221;s and &#8220;well&#8221;s that you don&#8217;t even notice when you&#8217;re trying to think and talk at the same time. Relax into it and practice until you&#8217;re as comfortable as you would be conversing with yourself, inside your own head. Then you&#8217;ll be able to express those</span></span></div>

You shouldn&#8217;t care. For you, this has to be more intrinsically fun and rewarding than lounging in front of your TV playing Wii. If that last sentence isn&#8217;t true, take a piece of advice from Deane and myself and </span></span><em><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">get out now</span></span></em><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">.

The work doesn&#8217;t go away. When you buy a sample library, that&#8217;s a choice. You&#8217;re spending money you could be spending on your family. When you sign up for folk dancing lessons, that, too, is a choice. Those Wednesday nights just became unavailable for work. Make your choices with your eyes open. Be ambitious, but be reasonable… and be aware that for each door you open, another closes (and often that&#8217;s just fine). There&#8217;s a fine line, though, between hard-ass and dumb-ass…</span></span></div>

And it&#8217;s absolutely wrong. This is a distance event, and going about it full-steam, all the time, to the exception of everything else in your life, is merely going to burn you out. The idea of working hard all the time was what I was trying to get across—defining a harder &#8220;base level&#8221; of output and hustle than you think you&#8217;re capable of (because I think most people underperform most of the time)… but forgetting that it is a lifetime pursuit is, in fact, dangerous. Be aware.</span></span></div>

And who really wants to play that through to its conclusion? In a best case the project will be a roaring success—and you&#8217;ll be labeled as someone whose opinion is, in fact, contrary to your own. And you&#8217;ll have to continue to do gigs like that. You&#8217;ll be making money, sure, but you&#8217;ll hate every gig that comes along. It&#8217;s not worth it. Be yourself—have strong musical ideas and storytelling opinions—and find those filmmaking partners whose tastes align with your own. It&#8217;s the best way to end up in one of those &#8220;magic relationships&#8221; (think Burton/Elfman, Spielberg/Williams, Hitchcock/Herrmann) we all dream of having.</span></span></div>

There are months, years, spent on one level of the terrace… and then, with a single gig, things change. I don&#8217;t know of a single career in film music that has proceeded along a smooth upward slope (of the sort you might see in, say, business management). There&#8217;s no &#8220;expected path,&#8221; no &#8220;annual performance review&#8221; beyond what you set for yourself.</span></span></div>

<div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Finally, I&#8217;ll throw one more small detail that makes a difference: pick a physical style for yourself (hair, wardrobe, accessories, etc.) that matches your persona as an artist and cultivate that image. It&#8217;s shocking how being awkward, antisocial and sloppy doesn&#8217;t do much to advance your career, but I wouldn&#8217;t write this as advice if I didn&#8217;t see it in would-be composers out here in LA all. the. time. Shocking, really.</span></span></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you&#8217;ve just finished a great cue, and the director decides he doesn&#8217;t like it at all &#8211; &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">scrap it, start again</span>&#8220;. Well that was a bit of a waste of music wasn&#8217;t it? Not necessarily&#8230;</p>
<p>Selling and licensing your unused, or even used tracks and cues in some cases, can be a great way to supplement your income as a composer in your spare time. There are literally hundreds of websites out there (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_music">Music Libraries</a>), where you can upload and sell your tracks as mp3 downloads for people to listen to on their ipod, or where you can even license your tracks to potential clients for films, video games, websites and more. I can&#8217;t remember where it was, but I read online recently that over 1/3 of the music industry in America is based on music licensing &#8211; if thats even anywhere close to being true, it gives you an idea of how big an industry music licensing really is. Here&#8217;s another way of looking at it &#8211; do a google search for &#8220;Music Licensing&#8221; &#8211; you&#8217;ll get <span id="main" style="visibility: visible;"><strong>19,300,000</strong> results for that phrase alone&#8230;</span></p>
<p>Selling your music online is a great way to supplement your income, but how exactly do you go about it? Well, firstly you can upload your tracks to different libraries (an overview on that, shown <a href="../../../2009/09/selling-music-online-stock-audio-market.html">here</a><span id="main" style="visibility: visible;">)</span> and sell licenses to use your tracks. Another way to do it, is to sell music downloads, and/or licenses via your own website. This can be particularly beneficial if you have a modest amount of traffic coming to your own website from anywhere and everywhere on the web. I&#8217;ve been experimenting with a number of different ways to sell and license my music in the past two or three years, and I&#8217;ve found a number of different ways to do it. I&#8217;ve failed miserably in some cases, had some good experiences in others, and also had a great time in the process.</p>
<p>In this article, I&#8217;d like to point you towards some of the products that are out there, which can help you achieve another stream of income as a composer &#8211; in particular products which will allow you to sell your music online via your own website, rather than uploading to another library and selling directly from their website.</p>
<p>Before we go anywhere, for those of us who don&#8217;t know what it is, we have to ask &#8211; &#8220;What is a Widget&#8221;? According to Wikipedia, a widget is:</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">A portable chunk of code that can be installed and executed within any separate </span><a style="font-style: italic;" title="HTML" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a><span style="font-style: italic;">-based web page by an end user without requiring additional </span><a style="font-style: italic;" title="Compiler" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compilation</a><span style="font-style: italic;">. </span>&#8221;<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
</span>There are two types of widgets available to musicians &#8211; those that allows sale as personal listening, and those that allow sales as licensing sales. There are far more &#8220;personal listening&#8221; widgets available, which allow you to sell your mp3 tracks for a few dollars per download, compared to the &#8220;licensing&#8221; widgets, which allow you to license your tracks directly from the widget on your website, meaning less work for you overall. I installed a number of different widgets on my website, and reviewed them below&#8230;.</p>
<h1>The Widgets</h1>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What they have to say</span>:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bandcamp isn’t Yet Another Place to Put Your Music</span>. Rather, we power a site that’s yours. So instead of ads for Sexy Singles Chat, your fans see your design, your music, your URL. You retain all ownership rights, and we just hang out in the background handling the tech stuff.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Choice</span>. We offer your tracks in mp3, AAC, FLAC, Ogg&#8230;all the formats your überfans demand. Choose between giving away your music, setting a price, letting folks name their price – it’s up to you.<br />
Viral distribution. We give your fans drop-dead easy tools to share your music with their friends, and most importantly we do it in a way that drives traffic back to you. We also give you complete transparency into how your music is spreading, with&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The motherflippin’ stats party</span>. We show you where your fans are coming from, what they’re listening to, even which tracks they’re obsessed with versus which ones they’re skipping over. And we make it real purdy, too.<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Your fifth (very nerdy) Beatle</span>. We provide fast, dependable streaming and downloads of your entire catalog, adorn your tracks with all the metadata they need to sail into iTunes with artwork, titles, and so on intact, and mutter the various incantations necessary to get your site top-ranked in Google. All things we know you could do, but we suspect you’d rather focus on your music. Well, think of us as your invisible bandmate who loves that other stuff. And we won&#8217;t even ask to play tambourine.</p></blockquote>

A quick look at their website will show you just how simple and intuitive it is. Uploading music is simple, as is changing the colours, background images, and artwork for your personal page. The entire website has been created based on the concept of being simple and easy to use, and they definitively get full marks for it. Once you sign up you get a choice of your own domain name at bandcamp (yourdomain.bandcamp.com). You can integrate this into your website, or use it as another site. A couple of questions I had were immediately answered in their <a href="http://bandcamp.com/faq">FAQ</a> section, and I have to say I found it very easy and almost fun to use their service.</p>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_HKS3fEP7Plc/S1WY5axKmmI/AAAAAAAAC58/fDqlksdcNuk/s1600-h/bc.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5428413038070504034" style="cursor: pointer; float: right; height: 351px; margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; width: 400px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_HKS3fEP7Plc/S1WY5axKmmI/AAAAAAAAC58/fDqlksdcNuk/s400/bc.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>One simply great feature of Bandcamp is that you upload either a wav, aif, or flac file to their server, and they will in turn convert it to all the possible formats anyone could want to download, and offer them as downloads &#8211; saves you having to upload lots of different formats! Bandcamp also offers custom domains which is a great service that I haven&#8217;t seen around much with these type of sites. Custom domain service means that you might own &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold;">http://filmcomposer.com</span>&#8221; and everytime someone goes to it, it goes straight to your bandcamp site and the domain in the address bar stays as &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold;">http://filmcomposer.com</span>&#8221; so it looks like its your website. Obviously you need to own your own domain name for that, but its an unusual but great feature.</p>
<p>Bandcamp is totally free as they are just starting up, and haven&#8217;t actually built a business model for the monetization side of it yet, but would rather see how it goes first. That <span style="font-style: italic;">does </span>mean that certain parts <span style="font-style: italic;">might</span> be subscription based in the future, but even taking that into consideration, its still a great service for selling your music.</p>
<p>They say on their website that they also do all of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">SEO</a> and marketing of your music for you, so I decided to try it out a few days later. I did a search for &#8220;my name + music track name&#8221; and it came up 9th on google which is very good going indeed considering its a completely free service.<br />

Bandcamp is a pretty awesome service , considering its totally free. Its not a feature rich website, but rather a simple and great way of selling your music. Some of the great features of the service are how they convert all of your music to numerous formats for you, provide you with your own domain name, and have unlimited free storage &#8211; you can also sell merchandise from the website aswell.</p>

The Reverb Nation store seems to lean slightly more towards people who play live shows, like bands etc. as they have a number of handy options for you to choose from in your control panel. For instance, you can bulk purchase CDs before a live show, to sell to your fans.</p>

Track uploads are limited to up to 8mb</p>
<p>The Reverb Nation store is probably the least customizable of all the stores I have tested, as the only options you can change are the size of the store. Nearly all the other stores will let you at least change the colours so it blends in better with your website. The store loads up in average time compared to others, and is very simple in layout and presenation. As you can see from my <a href="http://sonicoctave.com/example%203.html">example</a>, it is quite clean and effective &#8211; not overloaded with options, just a simple play button for each track and the price and download option also. It also contains a cart system so if you have a large number of tracks, people can add them to their shopping cart, and pay for them all in one go.</p>
<p>The payment system allows for payment via American Express, Discover, Mastercard or Visa. It is suprising that perhaps one of the most popular forms of online payment &#8211; paypal &#8211; was ommited from this, as in my opinion its a lot safer and easier to work with.</p>

Uploading and adding products to your store is quick and easy, but the plain looking user interface the customer sees, can look amateur and quite bland. In order to encourage customers to your store, it should be able to blend in elegantly with your website, and still have enough options to be usable, but unfortunately the RN widget falls a little short in my opinion.</p>

It blended in well with the colours, and looked sleek and simple like the rest of the website. Making the widget is absolutely simple &#8211; you simply join up to youlicense, upload your tracks, and then get your widget. When you get the code for your widget, they give you a few options in terms of colour, so you can incorporate your website colour scheme into the player which is a nice touch.</p>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_HKS3fEP7Plc/S1I1voZbl-I/AAAAAAAAC3g/ejFp0AJOB80/s1600-h/you+license2.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427459593349076962" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 190px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 400px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_HKS3fEP7Plc/S1I1voZbl-I/AAAAAAAAC3g/ejFp0AJOB80/s400/you+license2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Unfortunately, that is the only options you are given in the widget &#8211; one missing feature which I found annoying was the fact that you can&#8217;t opt out of the choice to sell your tracks as mp3s in the player. What this means is, if when you uploaded the tracks originally to you license, you chose the option to not sell the tracks as mp3s, then it will still show up on the player, and when you click on it, it will bring you to amazon.com strangely enough. I emailed support regarding this, and they told me that if you choose not to sell your music as mp3s for personal listening, then it will still keep the &#8220;buy mp3&#8221; link in the player, but default to amazon.com &#8211; it is something they are working on, and hopefully will resolve in the next version of their player &#8211; no update on the time frame for that.</p>
<p>Uploading to Youlicense was fairly simple &#8211; you can either &#8220;hard upload&#8221; (ie. actually upload the tracks) or give a link where the files are located on your server and stream them from there everytime someone listens to them on the youlicense website or via the widget on your website (you need to make sure your server can handle the amount of traffic this can bring). Another great option here is to upload all of your tracks from soundcloud.com if you have them stored on a soundcloud account. This saves you a lot of time and bandwidth if you have a lot of tracks!</p>
<p>After uploading, you are required to describe the song (Genre, Style, Mood, Instruments, Keywords, Pace, Resembles Artist, Subject, Lyrics, Vocal Type, Key, Language, Writer, Composer), select licenses and then select file versions on offer.</p>
<p>You can see the<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_HKS3fEP7Plc/S1I0kpFqN0I/AAAAAAAAC3Y/qqwP9OCzyrY/s1600-h/you+license.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427458305044395842" style="cursor: pointer; float: right; height: 192px; margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; width: 442px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_HKS3fEP7Plc/S1I0kpFqN0I/AAAAAAAAC3Y/qqwP9OCzyrY/s400/you+license.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> licenses you can offer in the picture on the right. You can either select an Indie, Web Value, Commercal or Premium (limited uses, premium members only). At this point you can also choose whether or not to offer to sell the track as an mp3 for personal listening, or if you&#8217;d just like to offer it purely for licensing purposes.</p>
<p>You License are a great company for customer service &#8211; they answered all of my emails usually within 24hrs, and as a music licensing business, they do well in offering numerous music licensing opportunities on their website which you can submit to.</p>

The You License widget is customizable enough to blend in well with any website, looks clean and elegant, but you will be charged 9% of any licensing sales you make via the widget/website and $0.10 for any mp3 sales you make if you are on the basic account, aswell as be limited to only 10 tracks. Upgrading to the Pro Musician account for $29.95 a year, means 0% commision on mp3 sales and licensing sales, aswell as unlimited tracks in your widget. The You License widget is a great option for most musicians who want to make a bit of extra cash on their tracks either by sales as MP3s, or through licensing deals.</p>

You create your account, login, and immediately start uploading music.One feature I didn&#8217;t like was that you are stuck at selecting one of 11 presets for your track prices, ranging from $0.29 up to $1.99. This drastically limits your choices, and I was curious as to why they don&#8217;t just allow you to set your own price.</p>
<p>Soundloud only accept mp3 files, meaing you can&#8217;t upload any production quality files &#8211; .wav files for instance.</p>
<p>An interesting addition to the player is that you have the option to create your own skin for the player<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">, </span></span>meaning it could fit in better to your own website. The soundloud basic account only allows for payment via paypal, amazon payments, and google checkout. In order to accept more payments, you have to upgrade to pro for $5 a month to allow mastercard, visa, discover and american express.</p>
<p>When embedded in your webpage, the widget comes in two colours &#8211; black or white. You are not given any options in the widget creation process to choose the size, which I felt was annoying as it means it can then be hard to embed it nicely in your site. I didn&#8217;t like the large &#8220;Soundstation&#8221; icon on the music player, but the &#8220;shopping cart&#8221; system allowing you to add a number of tracks to your cart before paying for all of them in one go is a nice addition, which was omitted from a number of other similar widgets.<br />

The fact that you are limited to selling tracks for between $0.29 and $1.99 isn&#8217;t incredibly appealing, but does make sense if you are only going to be selling your tracks for people to listen to &#8211; not many people would pay over $2 for a track to listen to on their ipod. I personally don&#8217;t think that the large &#8220;Soundstation&#8221; image on the widget is particularly appealing and can look a little unprofessional depending on its implementation. With a commission rate of $0.19 per song sold/$0.99 per album sold, Soundloud is certainly lower than its competitors.</p>

A few minutes after, it will show up in your widget and you can start selling your tracks.</p>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_HKS3fEP7Plc/S1WaL_u-UrI/AAAAAAAAC6E/tFaLXEJ24vs/s1600-h/thebizmo.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5428414456742695602" style="cursor: pointer; float: right; height: 261px; margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; width: 400px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_HKS3fEP7Plc/S1WaL_u-UrI/AAAAAAAAC6E/tFaLXEJ24vs/s400/thebizmo.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>The backend administration panel for the widget in your account on The Bizmo website, is very simple, and definitively not overloaded with features. In fact, it does not offer very many features at all compared to other widgets, and it appears that most of the handy options such as selling cds and dvds aswell as store customization, is limited to Bizmo Silver accounts &#8211; $34.95 per year &#8211; which is a slight let down.</p>
<p>The Bizmo&#8217;s widget, like most others reviewed, only allows for the sale of mp3 tracks and a maximum price of $4.50 per track. This means its not an option if you are looking for a widget to license your tracks with (unless you&#8217;re willing to license your tracks for $4.50 or less!).</p>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://sonicoctave.com/Icons/Crystal_Clear_app_reminders.png"><img style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 40px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 40px;" src="http://sonicoctave.com/Icons/Crystal_Clear_app_reminders.png" alt="" border="0" /></a><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The Bottom Line:</span> Another widget which allows you to sell mp3 tracks via your website. No licensing options, you only earn 62% of each sale which is a dramatically smaller amount than other widgets out there, and the fact that you have to upgrade to the Silver account to just customize the widget seems a little unfair. The large logo on the widget may look OK on myspace or facebook, but doesn&#8217;t do your website much justice if you are a professional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 30px;">Other Options</span></h1>
<p>So all of the above widgets rely on someone elses website/server/service in order to sell your music through them. Thats sort of against the whole reason you want to sell your music on your website right? I mean, I originally got interested in selling my music on my website as I wanted to get all of the money from the sale &#8211; not a percentage of it as would usually be the case with any websites you sell on. Therefore, I started to look into other ways to sell music online via your website, and found the following alternatives:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
<a href="https://www.paypal.com/ipn">Paypal IPN</a></span></span> &#8211; <span style="font-style: italic;">Free</span></p>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_HKS3fEP7Plc/S1Smd5GI8XI/AAAAAAAAC5Q/DKhunfgiD30/s1600-h/ipn.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5428146483361280370" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 106px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 330px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_HKS3fEP7Plc/S1Smd5GI8XI/AAAAAAAAC5Q/DKhunfgiD30/s400/ipn.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Example</span>: <a href="http://sonicoctave.com/album.html">Here</a></p>
<p>Possibly the easiest way to sell music on your website is via paypal. Paypal offer a very easy way of selling goods online, and receiving payments for them. To sign up for paypal takes only 2mins, and once you have an account, anyone can pay you via their bank account, or credit card (or a number of other ways also). In your paypal account, you can create &#8220;buy now&#8221; buttons, which you can put anywhere on your website, and customise to allow customers to send you money for whatever the product. Another great thing about this system is that paypal actually gives you the option of &#8220;IPN&#8221; (Instant Payment Notification), which can in turn offer &#8220;Digital Delivery&#8221;.</p>
<p>So what does this mean? Basically, lets say you have one track on your website that you want to sell. You create the paypal button, set the amount for $10, and put the button on your website. When someone clicks on that paypal button, they are brought to the paypal website, asked to pay $10, and then get given a link immediately to download the file from, once they have paid. &#8220;Digital delivery&#8221; allows you to accept payment, and send the file to the client, all while you&#8217;re asleep in bed! Once set up, it automates the entire process, and you can sit back and wait for the money to come rolling in.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Demo</span>: <a href="http://deliveryscript.com/demo/ds-admin/">Here</a></p>
<p>Theres also a really great script that you can buy and get installed called &#8220;Delivery Script&#8221;. I bought this myself originally when I was on the search for ways to sell music online via my website. This script basically makes the entire process of selling your tracks via paypal a HUGE amount easier by giving you a backend administration panel on your website to log into, and create your own links for people to click on. Once they click on the link, they are brought to paypal, asked to pay, and once the payment has been processed and received, they are given a unique download link via email which they can download your track from. Within your admin panel, you can set the generic download time for these links, aswell as a load of other handy options like creating a one-off download link for someone if say they paid you by cash, or somehow a payment went through incorrectly and didn&#8217;t give them a download link originally.</p>
<p>Oh and by the way&#8230;did I mention the owner of the script, Yuniar, is giving all SCOREcast readers 25% off the price meaning it is only $30! Thats a fairly awesome deal considering he installs it for you on your site aswell! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />

<p>Example: <a href="http://sonicoctave.com/music-licenses.html">Here</a></p>
<p>If you would like to be totally independent and sell music on your website without having to pay any other companies a % on sales from your own website, then a great alternative would be to have a look at some of the premade flash stores that are available out there. Perhaps one of the best examples of these that I have come across would be the &#8220;XML MP3 Store&#8221; by <a href="http://www.tpnwebdesign.com/">TPN Web Design</a>. The XML MP3 Store is the option I finally went with after trying all of the free options out there in the form of popular 3rd party widgets&#8230;..</p>
<p>The XML MP3 store is quite expensive (usual price of $400) when you compare it to the free alternatives out there, but a closer inspection reveals some really cool features which in my eyes really make it worthwhile. First off, lets look at the backend/administration panel of the store&#8230;</p>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_HKS3fEP7Plc/S1Wb37XBttI/AAAAAAAAC6M/TVssmM3v2kg/s1600-h/xmlmp3store.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5428416310994384594" style="cursor: pointer; float: right; height: 262px; margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; width: 400px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_HKS3fEP7Plc/S1Wb37XBttI/AAAAAAAAC6M/TVssmM3v2kg/s400/xmlmp3store.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>In the admin panel, uploading tracks and albums is simple. Select your .zip file of your album, upload it, then add your tracks one by one. When uploading your tracks, you are not limited to any price &#8211; choose $100 or $1.00 &#8211; the choice is up to you, unlike some of the other free widgets which limit you to certain price brackets.</p>
<p>In the general settings, you can input your own paypal email address, so that once someone pays for a track, you are sent the payment immediately to your own paypal account. Also in the general settings, you can change the currency &#8211; the standard is set at US dollars, but you can change it to Euros, Yen, or any other currency out there. This is handy as if you are located in Europe, and want to price all of your tracks in Euros, rather than using dollars, is a simple click and you&#8217;re done.</p>
<p>In the admin panel, another great feature is the ability to change the colours of the store &#8211; literally every single part of the store is customizable in terms of the colors you would like to use. This makes it one of the most customizable stores I have found out there . You can edits the colours in any and every way in order to make it blend in better with your website, making it look a lot more professional in my opinion.</p>
<p>One more option in the admin panel is the ability to track all of your orders from the store. You are given the paypal email address, price paid, date, as well as a few more handy options here. What I like about paypal is that you are given the email address of the person that sent you the payment for your track. As a composer starting off in the industry, I&#8217;ve found this helpful as I always follow up with people after they have bought a track from me for licensing purposes, to see if they would mind sharing what they&#8217;ve used it for with me. I can then add this to my demo reel to use later on if needed, and also keep in contact with them and possibly work with them in the future.</p>
<p>The XML MP3 store also has a shopping cart system like other previous stores reviewed, but it is a lot more sleet and professional looking, to my eyes at least. The amount of tracks you &#8220;Add to the cart&#8221;, show up just above the &#8220;Featured Albums&#8221; part of the store in the top left hand corner. Once you view your cart, you can add/remove items, then go to the checkout process at paypal, and complete the transaction.</p>
<p>Oh and yet again, for all you SCOREcasters, Thinesh &#8211; the creator of the store &#8211; is giving you all <span style="font-weight: bold;">25% off</span>, and offers the store at a reduced rate of $300 (just include the code &#8220;SCOREcast&#8221; when you contact him!) It looks like a lot to fork out, but in my opinion it is definitively worth it (and no I don&#8217;t work for him lol &#8211; I just think its great!)</p>

<p>Heres a few more examples of some mp3 stores which are available for quite a low price &#8211; no subscription models or hidden costs &#8211; just a pre-made flash store which you can download and embed in your website immediately:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">More Widgets</span></p>
<p>There are a few other widgets that didn&#8217;t make it into this article in the end, such as <a href="http://www.musicane.com/home">Musicane</a>, <a href="http://www.snocap.com/">SNOcap</a> as their websites were down, and still are as far as I know. I tried to test the <a href="http://draft.blogger.com/amiestreet.com">Amie Street</a> widget also but after spending literally hours looking for it on their website, I hit a brick wall. I email support asking for information on it, but unfortunately have not got any reply. There are a number of other widgets out there also, such as <a href="http://www.projectopus.com/">Project Opus</a>, <a href="http://www.audiolife.com/default.aspx">Audiolife</a>, and <a href="http://fizzkicks.com/">Fizzkicks</a> which I did not review as they were either similar to the other widgets, or based more around bands and live musicians, rather than composers.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 180%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">In Conclusion</span></span><br />
<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://sonicoctave.com/Icons/Crystal_Clear_app_lists.png"><img style="cursor: pointer; float: right; height: 128px; margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; width: 128px;" src="http://sonicoctave.com/Icons/Crystal_Clear_app_lists.png" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />
Hopefully this article has given you an idea of what is available out there for musicians and composers alike to supplement your income. One thing that I didn&#8217;t mention in the article is how you can <span style="font-style: italic;">technically </span>license your tracks on your website. The YouLicense widget does all of the licensing with contracts etc. for you, but thats the only one. If you are selling your tracks through a store like the XML MP3 store, then you <span style="font-style: italic;">could </span>state on your website that people can download the tracks and use them in certain projects for the price determined on the player and ask them to keep your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_rights_organisation">PRO</a> details and fill in a <a href="http://www.ascap.com/playback/2005/winter/cuesheets.html">cue sheet</a> where necessary.</p>
<p>Another option to look at, is to offer your tracks for download under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licenses which are available for everyone to use. These are thing you will need to look into yourself, as to be honest, I&#8217;m still learning all of this, and don&#8217;t know all of the legal side of music licensing &#8211; so be sure what you&#8217;re doing is safe and correct before doing it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>A few things to take into mind when looking to sell music via your website using a widget, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much commission will the company who owns the widget take?</li>
<li>How adaptable and customizable is the widget to blend into my website?</li>
<li>How easy is it to use the widget, and keep track of sales etc.?</li>
<li>What licensing options does it offer and how well created are they legally?</li>
</ul>
<p>So there you have it &#8211; an introduction to how to sell and/or license your tracks on your own website. Please bare in mind, this article is only an introduction to it all, and I&#8217;m a toddler in the industry &#8211; what I&#8217;ve learnt and wrote here is just my thoughts and discoveries so far &#8211; its not the be all and end all by any means.</p>
<p>A few side notes &#8211; my website (SonicOctave.com) is currently still being finished off, so some parts of it are still unfinished, such as the header image being too small. Also, the prices I have selected on my music store are just for purposes of example &#8211; the entire model is likely to change once I decide on a few things. I wouldn&#8217;t advise you to license your tracks for $20 at all <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Remember to put your PRO/ASCAP etc. number on your website, and encourage people to fill in cue sheets so you are also getting royalties for your music.</p>
<p>Remember to hit me up in the comments section if you have any questions, or anything to add or say on the subject!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tell me if this scenario sounds familiar to you.</p>
<p>A filmmaker approaches you about a gig, and really wants you for the job. In your excitement, you talk through the particulars and get all of the information that you can&#8230; except for the <em>money</em> part. The conversation continues until, finally, there is nothing left to talk about EXCEPT for the money part, and now you are in that awkward position of doing the <em>asking</em>&#8230; since nobody is freely <em>offering</em>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all heard the old saying in our profession, usually in the context of speaking to someone about a possible project: &#8220;Fast, cheap, or good. Pick two!&#8221;</p>
<p>To be honest, I&#8217;m not sure where this adage came from. The first time I remember hearing it was in high school when someone wanted to hire a friend of mine to paint their house. After they haggled back and forth for what seemed like 45 minutes, my buddy finally said, &#8220;Listen man! You can&#8217;t have everything when you don&#8217;t have any money. Fast, cheap, or good&#8230; you can only have two!&#8221;</p>
<p>When I was starting out on the road to composing for film, I quickly realized the value of that statement. It seemed every time I turned around, my employers wanted all THREE. Their schedule was short, their money was tight, and their expectations were high. As it turns out, &#8220;Fast, Cheap, AND Good&#8221; is an impossible impossible standard to meet. So, picking two is very important. Over the years, the philosophy behind this ideal has served me well. I&#8217;ve used it too many times to count in order to help preserve my margins and stay competitive as a composer. It has taken some time, but I&#8217;ve had to really train myself to not be afraid of the money conversation with a producer, although I try to leave such dealings to my manager as often as I can.</p>
<p>However, there is a time and a place for everything, and what I&#8217;m about to say might be viewed as controversial, but I believe it needs to be discussed:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Not every composer is worth paying.<br />
</em></p></blockquote>
<p>What I mean by this is that a lot of people I know who are just getting started get going with the wrong idea&#8230; That simply because they have chosen composing for film and TV as a career choice, a producer should be paying them a certain rate based on the baseline value of a minute of music. Not true at all.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll illustrate what I mean with a personal story.<br />
I know a fellow who is an incredible musician and wants to be a film composer. He is a gifted pianist and has more degrees on his wall than I would know what to do with. A while back, a gig that I was working on required me bringing in some help to finish up some source material at the last minute. I called this guy to see if he would be interested in jumping onboard. The production, although not gigantic, was sizable enough that I had about $2,500 left over to spend on source music. All I needed was three minutes of techno music to use for scenes set at a rave, and licensing a few tracks wouldn&#8217;t do the job — the music had to written for the scene. My friend, who was really hustling to find some projects to get him started, was the perfect candidate for this and it would, I thought to myself, afford him a few immediate perks — a strong film credit, some quick cash, and a stepping stone into some larger projects. For someone who&#8217;d never done anything, it was the perfect opportunity. Honestly, it would have been a walk in the park for anybody.</p>
<p>As I approached him with the plan and laid out what I needed for the gig, I told him what the budget was. His response? &#8220;I don&#8217;t get out of bed for less than $5,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>After I wiped the shock off my face, I responded. &#8220;With all due respect, pal, you have never scored a single frame. What do you mean you &#8220;don&#8217;t get out of bed for less than $5,000&#8243;? Nobody&#8217;s ever asked you to GET OUT OF BED, PERIOD!&#8221;</p>
<p>I cannot tell you how many times I&#8217;ve seen a composer price themselves out of the game. You see, it&#8217;s not that this guy wasn&#8217;t able to give me music that sounded like $5,000 music. He was. His talent wasn&#8217;t the issue. His worth was the issue. The fact of the matter is that he wasn&#8217;t worth $5,000. His resume wasn&#8217;t a 5k resume. Hell&#8230; it wasn&#8217;t even a 2.5k resume — he&#8217;d never done anything! He had nothing under his belt, no prior portfolio of work by which to show me he had worth as a composer, and therefore no guarantee, based on track record, that he could do the job that someone who was truly worth $5,000 could.</p>
<p>In short, his <em>worth</em> didn&#8217;t line up with his <em>wishes</em>.</p>
<p>It is a hard truth, but you have to be a realist about <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">where you are at</span></em> in your career vs. <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">where you want to be</span></em> with it. They aren&#8217;t the same, and your perceived value as a marketable composer in the community will reflect the former, not the latter. Getting the gig is all about timing, reputation, and perceived value. It really has little to do with talent. You might not even be a great composer, but for whatever reason you have done some projects and have proven that you can get the job done. Therefore, your perceived value is higher than the guy who hasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>You have to work your way up. I face it constantly at the level that I am at. I&#8217;m light years from where I was when I first started in the gig, but I&#8217;m also light years from where I want to be. While I&#8217;ll never be comfortable or content with where I am in my career, I am aware of what level I am perceived at by most producers and am working to get myself to the next terrace. Based on that rational, I don&#8217;t expect to be handed <em>Star Wars: Episode 7</em> tomorrow, but I&#8217;ll treat my current gig as equal to that opportunity and knock the ever-loving hell out of it!</p>
<p>So&#8230; Fast, Cheap, or Good? They say to pick &#8220;two&#8221;. But I say&#8230; pick <strong><em>GOOD</em></strong>. You really might be as great as you think you are, yet you are underpaid. It&#8217;s a common tale. But your perceived value as a composer is what is keeping you from the next level, NOT the economy of film music. No excuses.</p>
<p>Too many composers use the economy of film music as a reason to write poorly. In fact, I personally believe that some of the confusion surrounding this proposed composers&#8217; union in LA is born of that same attitude. Far too many composers don&#8217;t understand where they stand in the food chain (or don&#8217;t want to understand), and they think that having a union is going to help them magically transcend their perceived value. It won&#8217;t. Please hear me&#8230; I&#8217;m NOT saying that the union is a bad idea. Not at all, in fact. What I&#8217;m saying is that the <em>idea</em> that a union will help you get more gigs as a mediocre composer is just plain silly. You&#8217;ll simply be a composer who&#8217;s not very good in a union with composers that are. At that point, it just sucks to be <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the bottom line? Make everything you do the best you&#8217;ve done. That is the way to the top. There are no shortcuts, there are no magic spells, there are no perfect answers. The only thing you have on your side is your word, your talent, and your perceived value in the marketplace. You have absolute power over all three of those things, but the third one will take the most work. Yes, your perceived value can be bolstered by you holding hard and fast to the baseline value of your music, but don&#8217;t overestimate or naively inflate that number.</p>
<p>If your perceived value is &#8220;$0&#8221; (you&#8217;ve never worked a paying gig), then you should be taking a look at every gig and working every angle. That is the minimum requirement, anymore, to getting started it in this gig. You do not have the time or luxury for delusions of grandeur. You can&#8217;t be choosy. You need to work and you need to work <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>Know where you are. Accept it, come to terms with it, do your best, and push hard for the next terrace. You never know.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way&#8230; Whatever happened with my little $2,500 source music debacle? I used a friend of a friend for the gig who was excited to just be working on something that was going to be seen. We worked great together. So great in fact&#8230; that he now composes with me on a show for primetime television.</p>
<p>He just bought a house in Hancock Park.</p>
<p>You never know.</p>

<strong>Are you <em>ready</em> to get the gig?</strong><br />
<strong></strong><br />
<a name="more"></a><strong></strong><br />
When I talk to film scoring students, everything we discuss is framed around <em>facilitating their ability to say yes</em>… because just about the toughest thing you can have happen in your career is to land a gig before you&#8217;re ready for it. Facilitating your ability to say yes means that you&#8217;re identifying areas in which you need to improve so that you&#8217;re ready for anything.</p>
<p>Creatively, technologically, mentally, physically, emotionally and in all kinds of other ways, you have to be in a position to be better than the work deserves. Not that the project is necessarily bad—but, as Richard Bellis is fond of saying, &#8220;in order to move up, you have to be better than the material you&#8217;re scoring.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wrestling with your samples… if your team is still learning to work together… if you&#8217;re stressed out and sleep deprived… you might not be in a position to do your best work. In fact, you might not be in a position to say yes at all. What promises to be a big career boost can become a long-term career anchor—even something that knocks you back to Square One—if you can&#8217;t deliver.</p>
<p>If you follow SCOREcast faithfully this month, you&#8217;re going to pick up ideas and techniques that will, if applied regularly and with liberal amounts of hustle, bring in some gigs. Our kung fu is strong. By February you&#8217;ll have a few new moves to try out, and we&#8217;re going to get you psyched again about getting out into the world and kicking down the doors.</p>
<p>So, just between you and yourself, ask yourself: are you ready to get the gig?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s no secret that 2009 was a slow year for a ton of people. Coming off the slump that the world economy has been in for the last two years, for many facets of the entertainment biz, things couldn&#8217;t get much worse. As we’ve wrapped up this last year, I have heard numerous sighs of relief, seen many puffed up cheeks of exhaustion, and felt the overwhelming dark cloud of “what now?” on Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter. Generally, it seems that most of us are perfectly happy to blow a kiss goodbye to the last decade and get on with this new one that, just like that, is suddenly upon us.</p>
<p>As we focus on this new year, and with that, the new topic here at SCO of “Getting the Gig”, I’d like to encourage you and your business by suggesting something to you that you may not appreciate. You know — one of those slightly annoying Ogden diatribes that gets under your skin, pisses you off, and just generally makes you angry that I even decided to post on SCO today to begin with. Just think of me as the one guy in your corner who won’t always tell you what you want to hear. I’ll leave that to the 1.1 million other people in Hollywood! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Someone who was a huge influence in my life was the late great Michael Kamen. I was fortunate to study under Michael for a very short time before he passed, and I learned a lot from him about this gig and how to sustain a career in it. I also learned about the importance of an encouraging word and a helpful heart &#8211; two things that Michael believed in and practiced daily.</p>
<p>One of Michael’s favorite things to say to any of us students was always “There’s no crying in film scoring!” This, of course, was his paraphrase of a famous line from the Penny Marshall film A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN, when Tom Hanks’ Jimmy Dugan proclaims to a sobbing female infielder, “There’s no crying in baseball!”</p>
<p>Michael Kamen was right. There, in fact, *is* no crying in film scoring. If you are upset about the way that your career is going, change it. Don’t pout, blame, whine, accuse, or assign the reasons for your failures to anyone or anything but yourself. You can’t. You own them all. They are yours, whether you like it or not. The trick to this gig (or any gig, for that matter) is when you get knocked off the horse, dust your ass off and get back up on it again. Keep moving ahead. Keep writing music. Don’t stop writing for a single second.</p>
<p>When you are not writing film music, you are not being a film composer. You are being&#8230; whatever it is that you are doing other than writing. An office assistant, , a gofer, a professional lunch eater, whatever. But you aren&#8217;t being a film composer. So stop that. If this last year felt slow and you are afraid of another slow year, get busy and make some calls. Go to some parties. Connect with some writers or directors or gaffers or location scouts or costume designers. Find out what <em>they</em> are working on, and find an “in”. Schedule a meeting with the principals. DO something.</p>
<p>2010 is not going to be the “Year of the Whiner”. It is going to be the year in which those who have their heads in the game and get their asses moving are going to be the ones getting the gigs. It’s all about “hustle”; it’s all about desire; it&#8217;s all about action. What are YOU willing to do to get on your next show? Are you willing to demo five times for FREE? You might have to. In fact, you&#8217;ll probably have to. Are you willing to fork out that extra grand you really don’t have right now so that you can have a decent string library to mock-up cues with? Better yet: Are you willing to spend the $10,000 it would take to hire an LA string section to touch up those demo cues you wrote in November?</p>
<p>What will you “risk” in order to “achieve” this year? What will you <em>not</em> do this year that you did too much of last year? What will you do more of in 2010 that you should have done more of in ’09? Time to take inventory.</p>
<p>Yes. Take a good, hard, honest look at how you ran your business in 2009 and ask yourself the tough questions. Were you a hustler last year, or did you rely on others to pick up the phone and call you? Did you invest in yourself at all (via gear, promotion, networking, etc.), or is the &#8220;awareness needle&#8221; at about the same hash-mark that it was this time last year for you in the film production community?</p>
<p>Last thing: Have you already started this new year&#8230; this new DECADE&#8230; with a negative attitude? It’s a tired adage, but it’s a true one: Attitude is everything. <em>Maybe you should be being thankful that you are still in the game at all!</em> This is a tough business and a difficult career choice. I’ve said it before: If you are great at something else besides scoring films, please&#8230; for the love of all that&#8217;s holy&#8230; DO THAT! This gig is not easy. I said all that to say that if you are still here after a year of trying, kudos to you. Seriously. Most people are long gone by now. You should be proud of yourself and excited to kick 2010’s ass. That&#8217;s no small feat.</p>
<p>We could all learn from Michael Kamen&#8217;s feelings about whining and crying in this gig. Perhaps his sentiment can be summed up by an exhortation from a character in one of his most popular films. After Robin of Locksley launches into his warrior companion Azeem for choosing to meditate instead of help his new friend defend himself from a group of menacing marauders, Azeem observes, &#8220;You whine like a mule. You are <strong><em>still</em></strong> alive!”</p>
<p>Be thankful, be humble, be happy. You’ll be a better composer for it. The best way to “get the gig” is to first show up. The second best way is to show up with an infectiously positive attitude.</p>
<p>Start this new decade off right&#8230; and get one.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[There are few if any “constants” in our world. The only one Iʼm sure about is evolution.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong>There are few if any “constants” in our world. The only one Iʼm sure about is <em>evolution</em>. Change. This, then, may be the epitome of an oxymoronic phrase: “<em>The only constant is change</em>.”</p>
<p>This personal wisdom (if indeed it is either personal or wisdom) comes to me at sixty-three years of age. Many things are falling away at this age, but retrospect and derivative knowledge are the offsets. No young person, unless he or she is clairvoyant, can claim this perspective.</p>
<p>Evolution moves at a glacial pace. It moves like the growth of a tree, like the appearance of facial hair on a prepubescent male. It seems to move slower as our attention spans shorten. Often evolution is imperceptible due to this slow pace until it reaches critical mass. When it hits critical mass, mankind clusters in an effort to speed up evolution. Global warming will be solved, but the progress in alternative energy has, until recently, been glacial. All of a sudden it seems Iʼm not the only one with a ﬁve kilowatt solar array on his property.</p>
<p>In the big picture, evolution can be viewed as positive, but when broken into shorter periods its effects often seem negative. For example: smoking and obesity. Looking back we can see that acceptance of these lifestyles happened slowly… until recently, when that “cluster” of humanity decided to move these items to the top of the priority list and do something about them.</p>
<p>These are obvious, in-your-face examples. They affect large numbers of people from a health standpoint as well as a ﬁnancial perspective when you consider the cost of medical treatment for complications from both.</p>
<p>Our business, the business of creating music for ﬁlm, television, media (and whatever else might come along) is also evolving. By its very nature, our music is designed to be subliminal. It is consequently not in-your-face, and does not affect people as dramatically as cancer or diabetes. Any negative effects resulting from evolution will not easily be noticed. Nor will they motivate clusters of ﬁlmmakers, composers or even audiences to undo what has been done.</p>
<p>So, what am I saying? What is this “negative” evolutionary effect, and what is the cause? Should we do something about it, or will big-picture evolution eventually take care of it as is happening with smoking and obesity?</p>
<p>It was recently announced that China is contemplating sweeping changes to their higher education system. Apparently they have been teaching a very narrow curriculum, based almost entirely on existing knowledge. This dates back to the early days of communism and the belief that an education concentrated on a speciﬁc skill set, say engineering, would produce the worldʼs best in that particular ﬁeld. What has evolved as a result is a population with extremely good working skills, but without the ability to invent, imagine, probe or discover. It is now speculated that a more liberal education coupled with life experience is imperative to achieve these qualities.</p>
<p>When I ﬁrst became interested in Film Scoring (circa 1962) there was one book available on the subject: <em>Underscore</em>, by Frank Skinner. That was it. Only years later did <em>Sounds</em> <em>and</em> <em>Scores</em> by <a class="zem_slink" title="Henry Mancini" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000049/" rel="imdb">Henry Mancini</a> hit the market. You could not take a college course on ﬁlm scoring. As a matter of fact, no one could actually tell you how to become a ﬁlm composer. So the “burning desire” was sated by merely writing music—for anything and everything.</p>
<p>The result of all that writing was a musical vocabulary that was both diverse and personal. It would be the equivalent of the musical vocabulary accrued by the instrumentalist who has played in bands and orchestras from an early age. The other equally important adjunctive skill was working with a plethora of varied personalities. Jazzers, Vegas people, concert promoters, road managers, Top 40 acts, all with different visions and expectations about their music.</p>
<p>We now have courses in Film Scoring at most major universities. Some even offer a Masters degree in the subject. I had a student begin studying privately with me when he was only 16 years old. This proliferation of  possibilities for an education in ﬁlm and media music is the product of supply and demand. In the Sixties there were a handful of ﬁlm composers and that was enough. The process of making ﬁlms was slower (pre-digital, you know), so fewer ﬁlms were made and the tried and true professional composers could not only handle the workload but could prosper doing it.</p>
<p>Todayʼs ﬁlm composer community is extremely large. The size is reﬂected in all the college courses that have sprung up over the last 10 years. This makes competition keener, and consequently increases the need to start on this educational path as early as possible.</p>
<p>Compared to concert music, the amount of ﬁlm music available for study is miniscule. Less than a hundred yearʼs worth. And styles of ﬁlm music have changed so radically that, unless you are a history buff, you will likely be listening to examples from the last 5 or 10 years.</p>
<p><em><strong>Think China! Think variety!</strong></em></p>
<p>There have always been qualitative differences in ﬁlm music, even when there was only a handful of composers. There was good ﬁlm music and not-so-good ﬁlm music, but at least it emanated from the minds (some better equipped than others) of human beings. Human beings, each with a personalized musical vocabulary.</p>
<p>One of the undisputed technological accomplishments in recent times is what we often refer to as <em>emulation</em>. We write with an <em>emulated</em> orchestra—an <em>emulated</em> oboe or French Horn. This ability would be categorized as an “advance” in technology if it werenʼt for the fact that it is, as we speak, paving the way for—are you ready?— <em>EMULATED FILM MUSIC</em>.</p>
<p>“It sounds just like ﬁlm music!”</p>
<p>I started arranging at the ripe old age of 13. I was NOT a prodigy. I merely had an interest and, more importantly, a father who had been a dance band leader in the 30ʼs and was now a junior high school music teacher. MY junior high school music teacher.</p>
<p>Hereʼs the thing about the (almost lost) art of arranging: unless youʼre a student, there is NO emulation. Emulation would be anathema to arranging. As an arranger you take an existing song and try your damnedest to put it into a musical genre or setting in which it has never existed previously. This requires imagination. The same imagination that those whom we “emulate” have.  Technology and the internet have given us the ability to quickly and thoroughly analyze music. We can slow things down and grab every note and glissando in an effort to see what those “anointed” among us have done. This is the equivalent of Chinaʼs higher education based on existing knowledge.</p>
<p>For the gear junkies, or technogeeks, this is the best thing that could happen. It is the very justiﬁcation we need to buy that new library of sounds or those incredible reverbs. The better the sound, the more it sounds just like MUSIC! Whoo hoo!</p>
<p>Every year, for the past twelve years, I listen to the demos submitted by the top ﬁfty or sixty applicants to the ASCAP Television and Film Scoring Workshop. I know what I hear. There are a few very original works every year, but the majority are, to a greater or lesser degree, derivative.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is no fault of the emerging composers who submit.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Then whose fault is it?” you ask.</p>
<p>“Evolution,” I reply. And, subsequently, is it a “fault” at all?  Maybe itʼs just the new reality. Entertainment is changing; attention spans are changing. Hell, wars are changing. Governments are changing.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Iʼm not sure that there is anything to be done or that there is anything wrong… except that Iʼm betting you would like to ﬁgure out, in a “cattle call” world of media composers, how to get work. How to be noticed in the “herd.”</p>
<p>I used to open my classes with the following question: “How much money do you expect to make, annually, as a ﬁlm and television composer?”</p>
<p>Hereʼs the new question that starts off my class: “How many of you have: Stormdrum; East/West Gold or Platinum Orchestra; Vienna Symphonic Library Orchestra or Strings; Ivory; Hollywood Strings?”</p>
<p>“If you all have the same sample libraries, (and Iʼm thinking to myself, &#8220;…and are emulating Giacchino, Zimmer, Newton-Howard, Newman and Horner&#8221;), what separates you from everyone else?”</p>
<p>Now, once youʼre hired, you most likely will be asked to recreate the temp score while circumventing copyright infringement, but, at least in your demos, you have the freedom to be creative and, OMG, maybe even give the ﬁlmmaker an idea that doesnʼt already exist in at least one other ﬁlm.</p>
<p>When it boils down to merely a price war, no one wins. As I am known to ask, “How many $5,000.00 projects do you have to get every year to support yourself, your family and your gear while living in LA?”</p>
<p>By now you&#8217;re probably ready to go read something else unless I get to the point, and so I shall.</p>
<p>The computer is your tool box. You should set aside a period of time—between the viewing of the ﬁlm, scene or project and the time when you open your tool box—when the ONLY thing you do is something that can be done with your eyes closed.</p>
<p>The thing you possess, which no one else possesses, is your musical history of listening and playing. Your likes and dislikes; your musical tastes. These individual aspects of your work may not be perceived by the ﬁlmmaker as important, but they are the very factor that sets you apart from the herd.</p>
<p>Once you have the job, itʼs never about the music. Itʼs always about the ﬁlm. How you diagnose the dramatic impact of the ﬁlmmakerʼs vision is whatʼs important—NOT that you use Altiverb or sound just like “Whomever.” The determination of what is important to this particular ﬁlm or scene is not inside any library or sequencing software. I feel that the most damaging phrase in contemporary jargon is “Thatʼs cool.” Often, my response is “Very cool. Inappropriate, but very cool.”</p>
<p>Put your mind between the project and the computer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/11/sig-cooke.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-749" title="sig-cooke" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/11/sig-cooke.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="136" /></a>&#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">Conditions for creativity are to be puzzled; to concentrate; to accept conflict and tension; to be born everyday; to feel a sense of self</span>&#8221; &#8211; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Erich Fromm</span></div>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest &#8211; I&#8217;ve only been composing a relatively short while in comparison to a lot of other composers on here, so I don&#8217;t think that my creative process is in anyway matured &#8211; its probably all over the place and changes every time I create a score, or even music in general. I believe that I don&#8217;t have enough experience in composing yet, to think about my own creative process and see what it looks like, so while I was thinking about what to write about in this article, I started looking into the psychological side of the creative process, and look at some literature on the subject.  I think the actual reasoning behind <span style="font-style: italic;">why</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">how </span>your brain does something c<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span></span></span></span></span>an be a real eye opener in some topics of conversation, and I think its the case here also.</p>
<p>Do &#8220;successful&#8221; people have the same creative process, or does it change from person to person, and even project to project.   As I was searching for information on the psychological aspects of creativity, I came across an interesting article on &#8220;Creativity Models&#8221; and the literature that has been written on them in the last century.  One creativity model that caught my eye was that of <a href="http://www.robertfritz.com/">Robert Fritz</a> in 1991.</p>
<p>Fritz wrote about a  model called the &#8220;Process for Creation&#8221; (PFC) which reflected the stages in creative thinking, and creativity.  These steps are found below:</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>&#8211; Conception</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>&#8211; Vision</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>&#8211; Current reality</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>&#8211; Take action</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>&#8211; Adjust, learn, evaluate, adjust</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>&#8211; Building momentum</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>&#8211; Completion</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>&#8211; Living with your creation</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<p>I looked at the model and wondered &#8211; &#8220;does this reflect the process of composers while scoring for a film or even when creating music for any type of media/medium&#8221;.  Below is my thoughts on how this creative process model works in relation to scoring &#8211; maybe your thoughts on it will be different &#8211; let me know!</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Conception </span>&#8211; </span>&#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">Something conceived in the mind; a concept, plan, design, idea, or thought</span>&#8221;<br />
You&#8217;re handed the film, and watch it tens of times over. In your mind you start to hear sounds, musical lines, instruments etc. over different scenes and start to get a rough idea of what you&#8217;ll be doing for the score (varying degrees of roughness ranging from &#8220;I haven&#8217;t a clue&#8221; to &#8220;I know exactly what I want to do here&#8221;)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vision</span> &#8211; &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">The manner in which one sees or conceives of something</span>&#8221;<br />
You have a rough idea of what you want, next is something that I have read about a lot, and tried a number of times &#8211; it applies to all areas of creativity, and even goal setting.  You have to <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> (or hear) the end result.  You have to be able to imagine the finished product as though its right in front of you &#8211; know how it sounds, feels, looks.  The more vivid your vision of the end product or goal, the more likely you are to be able to make it a reality.  I read an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming">NLP</a> book once by Tony Robbins where he describes how he asked a number of successful people how they saw their goals.  He said that all of those people were able to literally feel, smell, touch and hear their goals &#8211; they were able to sit in the ferrari they wanted, and know the smell of the leather.  That strong vision of the end goal made it more real for them, and a lot easier for their brain to process just <span style="font-style: italic;">how </span>to make it happen for them.  Long story short &#8211; having a strong <span style="font-style: italic;">vision</span> of your end goal helps your brain to figure out what needs to be done in order to reach that goal.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Current Reality</span> &#8211; &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">Determining the availability of the tools and expertise required to complete the job</span>&#8221; (my definition at least!)<br />
You have a vision of the end result &#8211; you know what it is going to sound like (either a rough or detailed idea) &#8211; but you have to figure out what tools are required to complete the job.  Things to be taken into consideration are time, software, money, talent, relationship with director (does he like your idea?) etc.  For example, your vision of the score is of a beautiful symphonic piece scored on the Newman Scoring Stage with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra (not sure why they&#8217;d be in the US, but you never know!).  Of course unless you&#8217;re a multmillionaire and know a lot of people to pull the strings, this isn&#8217;t become reality, and if you continue to try and pursue this goal, it will most likely end in tears.  You need to evaluate the tools available to you, and determine if your vision of the score can become a reality, for example, within the confines of your schedule.  If it can&#8217;t, then you need to re-evaluate the vision, and sculpt it to suit the reality.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Take Action</span> &#8211; &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">Just do It! (Nike)</span>&#8221;<br />
I don&#8217;t think we need to go into great detail here do we? Probably the hardest of all the stages of creativity &#8211; actually doing it. Deliberation is a great killer at this stage, aswell as a short attentio&#8230;what was I saying? You know what you want at this stage, you know you can do it &#8211; just do it! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Adjust, Learn, Evaluate, Learn </span>&#8211; &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">To gain knowledge, comprehension, or mastery of through experience or study</span>&#8221;<br />
This, in my opinion, is where the director enters the picture once again &#8211; you show him/her your mockup of the score and get some feedback. You run back to the cave with the feedback from the director, and compose compose compose. You learn from the feedback, from the numerous hours of composing put in during the project (where you might learn new tricks, ideas, tips etc.) and from the whole experience of working on a film score.  I think subconciously, no matter what task you are doing, you brain evaluates for you, and you&#8217;ll most likely remember the next time you do that task, what worked, and what didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Building Momentum </span>&#8211; &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">Impetus of a nonphysical process, such as an idea or a course of events</span>&#8221;<br />
The score is due in 14 hours, and you&#8217;ve already been at it for a straight 12 hours today.  We all know that feeling of impending doom &#8211; its in those last few hours that you&#8217;ll get some of your best work done in my experience.  Everyone is different, but I know I am one of those people who loves a nice deadline far away, but will only do the work once I start to realise &#8220;oh crap&#8230;its like due in less time than I have to do it!&#8221;. (its a trait I&#8217;m working on!).  Its a nice feeling though being on on a roll, with the music flowing out of you like a runny nose on a winter&#8217;s day!  In the process of a film score, for a composer, a lot of things happen at this stage I think.  You&#8217;re preparing to get a live recording done (if you have the budget), you&#8217;re sending off your music to the orchestrator/copier etc. It all starts to come together and you get mixed feelings of &#8220;I can see the end&#8221; and &#8220;oh dear god, I hope this works!&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Completion</span> &#8211; &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">The act of finishing or the state of being completed</span>&#8221;<br />
Relax, the work is done. Get some sleep, see your girlfriend, open the curtains and let the sunlight in for the first time in how long?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Living with your Creation </span><br />
This is an interesting part of the process that Fritz included, and I&#8217;ve been thinking about it most of the day today.  In the last 1 or 2 years, I&#8217;ve interview a number of composers, ranging from amateur to professional, and asked them all the same question &#8211; &#8220;<strong>Do you find that when you’ve finished a cue/score/track, you’re sick of hearing it</strong>?&#8221;.  You&#8217;d be suprised the range of different answers I&#8217;ve received &#8211; from &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">I can&#8217;t stand listening to it</span>&#8221; to &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">Yes of course! I love it!</span>&#8220;.  I think being happy with your creation is quite an important part of the creativity process &#8211; perhaps even one of the most important parts in the long term.  If you&#8217;re not happy with what you&#8217;ve done, and you can&#8217;t stand back and go &#8220;Yea&#8230;this is awesome, and <span style="font-style: italic;">I </span>created it&#8221;, then in my opinion you won&#8217;t be happy with yourself and your ability to do the work in the future. Sure we&#8217;ve all done some crappy work at some stage of our lives, but you can at least see the potential in what you&#8217;ve done, and be happy with that at the very least.</p>
<p>Tell me in the COMMENTS what <span style="font-style: italic;">YOU </span>think about this model &#8211; total codswallop or bang on target?</p>

The problem gets even tougher when the music we write has to function as one part of a larger storytelling machine.</p>
<p>True to the name of this column, I&#8217;m going to give you a real View from the Trenches this month… outlining some of the problems and pitfalls I&#8217;ve encountered over a few (OK, more than a few) years of doing the thing. And maybe together we&#8217;ll come up with some techniques that will get you past the toughest spots.</p>
<p>So, in no particular order:<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blank Canvas.</strong></p>
<div>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I feel a little moment of panic every time I start a new cue. In a way that&#8217;s a good thing. It means I&#8217;m not taking the job for granted. And usually I&#8217;m past it fairly quickly… I&#8217;ve learned to trust my instincts (or at least give &#8217;em a fair chance). But if I stare at that blank canvas for too long, I start not wanting to be in the studio. My mind drifts. Surely there are other things I could be doing that would be more productive… more fulfilling… more fun than just sitting here, burning my retinas with monitor-glare.</p>
<p>The trick is to take tiny little steps at first, if that&#8217;s what it takes to get notes on screen (or on paper, if that&#8217;s how you work). Almost any little fingertip-hold on the cliff you&#8217;re about to scale will get your feet off the ground—and that&#8217;s all it usually takes to get you started.</p>
<p>A related problem sometimes occurs when I take an ear-break (composer code for &#8220;I can&#8217;t sit here for one more minute without throwing something through the screen&#8221;). The same problems, the same bad notes, the same controller information needing to be entered—it&#8217;s all going to be there when I get back. And it accumulates a sort of inertia while I&#8217;m gone. It&#8217;s always tougher to resume my place (mid-cliff, as it were) if I&#8217;ve stepped away before tending to something big that needs fixing.</p>
<p>Likewise, I create a potential problem for myself if I step away at the end of a phrase. This sounds weird, but I&#8217;ve had many experiences, some of them as recent as last week, where I create a single phrase or idea that I like a lot… I flesh it out as fully as I can imagine it… then take a break, thinking I&#8217;ll pick up right there later. And, later, I&#8217;m stuck. I don&#8217;t know where to take the damned thing. I attribute this in part to abandoning the chair at the crucial moment.</p>
<p>The takeaway here: be careful about interrupting your process, especially starting off a cue. Don&#8217;t get too far outside your own head. And stay on the cliff a little longer than you&#8217;re comfortable.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shiny New Thing.</strong></p>
</div>
<div>I mentioned this in the comments over the weekend—it&#8217;s possible to get so carried away with a new sound, or a new piece of processing gear, that you lose the original intent of the cue. The music you&#8217;re working on becomes an exploration, a test-drive of the Shiny New Thing.</p>
<p>We spend good money, and lots of it, on these new additions to our arsenal. It&#8217;s important to know their capabilities, strengths and limitations. But you have to be careful to set aside time for that when you&#8217;re not serving another imperative (i.e., scoring to picture). Simple as that.</p>
<p>To continue our &#8220;cliff&#8221; metaphor, this one is like finding a cool new set of handholds that may or may not lead you <em>up</em>. And up is where you have to go, before your strength runs out. Stay focused.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Troublesome Collaborator.</strong></p>
</div>
<div>Nothing saps your will to live—OK, maybe that&#8217;s an overstatement, but if you&#8217;ve been there, you know—like the filmmaker who wants seventeen versions of a cue. It&#8217;s not just the extra work. Coming up with yet another solution to the same problem, and another and another and another, does something to our confidence. It makes us mistrust our instincts. It makes us question our creative process itself.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong: If your score isn&#8217;t getting it done, you need to own that and make adjustments. Kill your favorite cue, if that&#8217;s what it takes (although maybe you&#8217;d do better to file it away for yourself, for later!). The bigger the project, the truer it is that the filmmakers <em>will</em> get the score they want. Maybe not from <em>you</em>, but they&#8217;ll get it from someone.</p>
<p>My only advice here is to remind yourself that this is all normal. Everyone goes through this at some point. Don&#8217;t let an annoyance become a self-fulfilling prophecy… the stress of worrying about falling off the cliff causes your palms to become sweaty, which causes you to slip… oops. Bottom line: content is not process. Problems with the former do not necessarily indicate problems with the latter. Just keep it in mind.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transition from Hell.</strong></p>
</div>
<div>Seriously, what&#8217;s the deal with transitions? I&#8217;ve mentioned it here before, in my article on workflow: You&#8217;re cruising along for bars at a time, when suddenly you&#8217;re mired down. Unable to get from Point A to Point B (which you&#8217;re already hearing, fully-formed, in your head). And you know the director is gonna bust you for that ham-handed excuse of a modulation you&#8217;re floating at the moment.</p>
<p>This cliff metaphor I started out with is making even me roll my eyes at this point, but I&#8217;m sticking with it. And here it&#8217;s so <em>obvious</em>: You&#8217;re on a path, and you see where it continues, about five feet over and three feet up—but you can&#8217;t figure out how to get there.</p>
<p>What to do? I&#8217;m no rock climber, but my guess is that there&#8217;s a whole batch of special techniques for handling exactly this kind of situation. Sometimes you&#8217;ll see those maniacs fling themselves across empty air, only to land exactly where they wanted. Controlled chaos. Other times they&#8217;ll do some crazy upside-down contortion, starting from an unlikely body position in order to end up properly. It all relates here as well, and we have the advantage that <em>no rule is permanent</em> (unlike on the cliff, where… you know… gravity).</p>
<p>So—first, check your <em>premises</em> at the transition. You can dump any and all of them, as long as it makes your ears happy. And sometimes dumping something you thought you needed is the kind of freeing move that will get you through. If Point B is where you&#8217;re determined to go, you can get there. I pretty much guarantee it. Even if you simply start playing different music. The brain has an incredible ability to connect things that at first don&#8217;t seem related. In a worst-case scenario, do what my mentor, Ron Jones, once recommended to me: write a drum solo.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impossible Mandate.</strong></p>
</div>
<div>Our creative process thrives on constraints. We predicate our writing on… something. Usually that&#8217;s a set of cohesive rules we have devised (consciously or not) for making the score convey meaning in as precise a way as we can muster.</p>
<p>But sometimes we&#8217;re asked to reconcile multiple sets of ground rules. Or multiple stylistic demands. Or creativity collides with plagiarism (&#8220;…just copy the temp&#8221; being the words one typically hears in such a situation).</p>
<p>All these are examples of starting from a place on our rock wall where there simply <em>isn&#8217;t</em> a pathway to the top. Once again, you have to check your premises, or those of your creative partners. Start from somewhere different, if possible, or go find another rock to climb. Usually, if you&#8217;re tactful enough about it, you&#8217;ll find that the filmmakers already know that what they&#8217;re asking you to do is fatally flawed. And then, with that concession in hand, you can work together on coming up with a solution. If not… there are always more rocks to take on. No reason to fall just for the sake of falling.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Immovable Deadline.</strong></p>
</div>
<div>Some people will tell you that it&#8217;s an absolute: the more time we have to compose, the better the final product. I think it&#8217;s true… but only to a point. Personally, I need deadlines. I&#8217;m my own worst taskmaster, but I respond well to fear. And nothing streamlines my creative process, nothing forces me to trust my instincts and write fast and loose, better than a tough deadline.</p>
<p>Sometimes the result is, at least to my ears, unpolished. I&#8217;ll give you that. But the occasional immovable deadline—of the variety that drives us to the coffeepot—acts as a confirmation. It proves the fundamental soundness of our creative process, our organizational structure, our team of personnel. It&#8217;s a crucible.</p>
<p>Getting through it is a confidence-builder. It&#8217;s a potent, concentrated form of the rush that keeps us all coming back to the studio in the first place.</p>
<p>By the way, I call this the &#8220;immovable&#8221; deadline, rather than the &#8220;inconvenient&#8221; or &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; or &#8220;sassy&#8221; deadline, because most deadlines can be begged into oblivion. Some can&#8217;t. You will find out which is which.</p>
<p>My advice: take it as a challenge. Call in your team, your colleagues, your composer-heroes, and crush that sucker mercilessly. And charge the client accordingly.</p>
<p>If there are any other pitfalls that come to mind—especially if you have some good techniques for getting past them—put &#8217;em in the COMMENTS, below. I would love to add some new chops to my own creative process, courtesy of SCOREcasters like you. So bring it.</p>
