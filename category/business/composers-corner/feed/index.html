				<description><![CDATA[Many might argue that Hollywood is more concerned these days about having "hit films" than it is about creating successful ones. What's the difference?]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p>What kind of &#8220;professional&#8221; walks out on a film set to start production in less than two weeks?James Franco does, that&#8217;s who. That&#8217;s right. After already spending half a million on pre-production just weeks away from shooting, James Franco pulled out of GARDEN OF LAST DAYS, a film he was directing and starring in. The reason? According to Mike Flemming at <em>Deadline Hollywood:</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Franco’s exit had to do with a disagreement with financier Millennium over the crew he wanted to hire. Basically, Franco put together a crew that didn’t &#8220;have the experience&#8221; to get approval from the bond company. Millennium wouldn’t approve his choices.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p>There are a couple different ways to interpret what happened. I realize we are armchair quarterbacking this and not privy to exactly what happened. But think about it with me for a moment. One possible scenario is that Millennium just did not want to do the project any more out of their fear it would lose money and they quietly, under the table, told the bond company to not approve the crew. This would allow them to save the relationship with their star Franco and blame the film not happening on the faceless bond company. That is a possibility. Also&#8230;I am told the bond company does not really care if the film is good&#8230;just if the film can be done on the budget laid out. It is possible the $3M budgeted was certain to go way over budget and the crew assembled did not have the experience to navigate a tight budget. They most likely met with everyone they would have been concerned about&#8230; and discovered the way they are wanting to shoot, there would be no way they were going to only spend $3M. The bond company estimation could have been much higher to finish the film Franco wanted to make and so determined his crew didn&#8217;t know how to be efficient with their choices. That is also possible for sure. But part of me thinks something else may be going on.</p>
<p>James Franco is a rather talented guy who has shown his talent both in front of and behind the camera. He also is someone in this industry who I would consider to be a true &#8220;artist&#8221;. I have always felt he is creating art when he works. He takes chances. He works on both indies and Blockbusters. He breaks barriers. And he has also finally earned the respect of many in Hollywood as an &#8220;A-list&#8221; actor. There is little doubt he knows what he is doing when it comes to making a successful film. So why would a studio/bond company trust him enough to hire him as a director, but not trust his choices for his crew?</p>
<p>I was speaking with a director/producer friend of mine.  He is an active AMPAS member, respected by his peers, and use to be a studio executive in addition to his producing work. So he has been on both sides of the process of making and releasing a film. He knows what he is talking about. He shared with me a profound concept that explains how to interpret what is going on in Hollywood here. And he learned it from Hal Prince, an American theatrical producer and director who has worked on many of the best-known Broadway musical productions of the past 50 years. Hal has garnered twenty-one Tony Awards, more than any other individual, including eight for directing, eight for producing the year&#8217;s Best Musical, two as Best Producer of a Musical and three special awards. Cabaret, West Side Story, Cats, Evite, Phantom Of The Opera. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Hal said there is a difference between a &#8220;Hit&#8221; &amp; a &#8220;Flop&#8221; and a &#8220;Success&#8221; &amp; a &#8220;Failure.&#8221; One set of terms has to do with money&#8230;the other does not.</p>
<p>A <em><strong>hit</strong></em> makes money. Lots of money.<br />
A <em><strong>flop</strong></em> does not.</p>
<p>A <em><strong>success</strong></em> is not tied to money but whether if it is successful in what it set out to do. (Tell a compelling story, entertain, etc&#8230;)<br />
A <em><strong>failure</strong></em> is unsuccessful in completing its goals.</p>
<p>How does this apply to Hollywood today? Many might argue that Hollywood is more concerned these days about having &#8220;hit films&#8221; than it is about creating film successes. A hit does not necessarily have to be a successful film. In fact, I would argue many hits today are not very successful films. How many times have you gone to see the latest blockbuster film and left the theater saying to yourself, &#8220;that was just not a good film.&#8221; And yet it made millions at the box office opening weekend. It was a hit. But as a film&#8230;it was a failure. Disney&#8217;s <em>John Carter</em> is a recent example many considered to be in the flop category. They did take a $200M write down on the film after all and Rich Ross resigned from his position at Disney over it.</p>
<p>On the contrary, there are many films that were extremely successful, but flops at the box office. Going back a bit into the 90&#8217;s, <em>Pleasantville</em> completely changed how the industry worked in Post-Production. A change still in effect today.  It was the first film to use a Digital Intermediate throughout the entire Post process for its groundbreaking color effects. Previous to this, the digital intermediate was used sparingly for FX shots only. Most people I know love the film and all of those associated with the film are very well-respected in Hollywood for their work on that film. It was truly a success in everything it set out to do and changed Hollywood for the better. But financially at the box office it was actually a flop.</p>
<h2>A New Paradigm</h2>
<p>We have to recognize that the financiers and studios today are much more interested in hits than successes. Despite his proven track record of success in film, Franco still could not get his chosen crew to get approved on this little $3 million dollar indie film. This is not hundreds of millions of dollars we are talking about here, but a very low budgeted $3M indie. And Millennium Films, according Deadline Hollywood, would apparently not approve his flop of a crew. Reading between the lines, I keep coming back to the thought that just because some on the crew had not made a $100M dollar hit film, does that necessarily mean they don&#8217;t know what they are doing on a $3M indie film? No. It doesn&#8217;t. The next Tariq Anwar (Editor &#8211; <em>The King&#8217;s Speech, American Beauty</em>), Freddie Young (Cinematographer &#8211; <em>Lawrence Of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago</em>) or Jerry Goldsmith could be among that young crew.</p>
<p>I continue to speculate here, but does anyone really think James Franco would be putting a crew together for a film he was reportedly passionate about that could not pull off what he wanted to do with this little indie? I don&#8217;t. I think the true artist in James was putting together the exact crew perfect to make THAT film&#8230;and yet because some of them were not on the Millennium short list of dept. heads in town, the financiers and bond company (who are experts at the numbers game and not artists and filmmakers) got nervous and began to butt heads with Franco. They did not trust him and his directing choices and probably lost interest in the project and were concerned it would be a flop.  Whether Millennium put the bond company up to not approving the project or not, we will never know. But Franco, out of true loyalty to his film&#8217;s vision and his chosen crew that he believed in, simply walked away. Proving to those around him that there is more to this business than making a hit.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong: The hits <em>are</em> important. They help the studio&#8217;s fund other productions. They <em>must</em> have hits. But if Hollywood is going to start making successful original films again, the films that will become iconic and remembered for generations to come, it is going to have to stop putting a &#8220;hit requirement&#8221; on everything it produces and take more chances across the board on both original stories and young, talented people. Especially the $3M indies like Franco&#8217;s GARDEN OF LAST DAYS and other &#8220;entry-level films&#8221; that are the proving grounds for the future generation of filmmakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&#8230;as composers..how does this apply to us,&#8221; you ask? Well, if you have never had a &#8220;hit&#8221; film&#8230;that does not mean you are not a successful composer. It does not mean you don&#8217;t know what you are doing or talking about. It means the folks out there that may be saying that are confused about the difference between a hit &amp; a flop and a success &amp; a failure. They are not the same. They are exclusive of one another. As a composer, you need to simply focus on making every film score you work on a success and stop worrying about whether it is attached to a hit. Does your music make the film better? Does it do its job well? Did you write a successful score? That is what you should be focusing on.</p>
<p>Hal Prince had it right.</p>
