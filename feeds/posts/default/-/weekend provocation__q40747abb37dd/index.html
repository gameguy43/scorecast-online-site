Why deny myself the (sometimes) glorious royalties that come from a wall-to-wall score? And doesn't \"writing as little music as possible\" sound, well, kinda of \u003ci\u003elazy\u003c/i\u003e?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMy rationale, and more… after the jump.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca name\u003d'more'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt's simple, really: If my default position is \u003ci\u003enot\u003c/i\u003e to score a scene, then including music becomes a conscious choice. In other words, I prefer to build in a decision point, right from the spotting session, in which there must be a argument for music.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWorking this way means the music has a better chance of being target-specific, rather than ubiquitous. It has a better chance of heightening the experience by its presence (and absence!), rather than simply serving as what it's often called: sonic wallpaper.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI say \"has a better chance,\" because working this way usually leads to conflict with filmmakers. You might be surprised how many filmmakers walk into a spotting sessions with the assumption that everything will be scored.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOnce, at a spotting session several years ago, I was even flat-out told: \"Just write music for the entire picture, and we'll throw out all the cues that aren't working.\"\u0026nbsp;Which was both refreshingly honest and casually insulting. When I launched into my whole \"concept of spotting\" spiel… you guessed it. Funny looks.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMaybe I was being \"too meta\" for them, talking about a philosophical framework… in fact, I can guarantee it. It's an understandable thing to want to do, but it's a telltale sign of inexperience. A rookie mistake.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHere's why:\u003cbr /\u003eOpening the door of talking about process can be counterproductive, even dangerous. Never more so than at a spotting session. It can erode the filmmakers' confidence in you. It can lead to blanket statements like \"I want you to score everything,\" out of a desire to cut to the chase. \"Process\" conversations, I've come to believe, are best left to cocktail hour… long after the gig is finished. They're abstract at a moment when you ought to be dealing in the concrete; they're speculative and introspective at a moment when you need to be definitive and self-assured. You're being hired for your opinion, not for out-loud musings about how you reach that opinion.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eA spotting session, as filmmaker meetings go, is a long one: it's at least the length of the picture (…right? Don't tell me you allow the filmmakers to \"skip to the next part where we're gonna have music\"!). Keeping things focused, setting a brisk pace, is an important precedent for your subsequent playback meetings.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAll of which is why I've adopted a \"just (don't) do it\" approach to spotting, in which I simply remain silent until I feel music is required. If, before that moment, the filmmaker asks \"…we're gonna have music here, right?,\" I can reply with a question: \"Why?\"\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis little verbal jujitsu move, if done in a friendly, genuinely-curious way, leads into the discussion I want to be having, within the frame in which I want to place it. And if the filmmaker offers up some obviously-just-concocted justification, it doesn't matter: you're still having the conversation. You're still taking part in the creative collaboration. Which means you're in a position to talk it over. And maybe, just maybe, change your own opinion. None of this should be construed as closed-mindedness.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe spotting process is under fire, in my view, and not just from people like the score-happy filmmaker I mentioned above. Projects for which a music library is used—which, I don't have to tell you, are more and more prevalent—don't even \u003ci\u003ehave\u003c/i\u003e spotting sessions. It's usually assumed those projects will be wall-to-wall.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOn more traditional projects, temp tracks often fall into place long before a composer is set. The spotting decisions made as the temp is assembled become a kind of default unto themselves. If we composers disagree, we have to fight harder than ever even to reach a place where we're deemed worthy of being allowed to voice an opinion on the subject. It's a moment in the creative process that, frankly, is in very real danger of falling out of our jurisdiction.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThat's a shame—it results in a shallower collaboration between filmmaker and composer, and in my opinion, a weaker end product. If I'm completely against the idea of placing music in a scene in the first place, how inspired am I really going to be when it comes time to score it? Besides, I've spent my whole career honing a dramatic sensitivity… a huge part of which is knowing how and when to enter and exit a scene. It's part of my identity as a (musical) storyteller. It's something I bring to the party. I think that deserves a hearing, and I encourage you to be similarly confident and persistent in your own spotting sessions.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd if you \u003ci\u003estill\u003c/i\u003e get funny looks from your filmmaking collaborators? Ignore 'em. If you're right, they'll come around.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI want to hear some spotting session success stories… and nightmares… from people this month! The more we all share, the better prepared we are when we walk into our own sessions. So bring it on. The crazier the better.

There's something there that makes you want to knock it out of the park… show the world what you can do… get off your rear end and write the Great American Film Score.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAll of which is usually followed by a sudden feeling of creative nausea. Musical constipation. Call it what you will—lots of people have called it lots of things, usually invoking some sort of unsavory gastrointestinal metaphor.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eInstead of writing music, you're \u003ci\u003ethinking\u003c/i\u003e about writing music.

He sat down at his piano and mentally let go of the whole cue for a little while. He played through a bunch of tunes he knew well, and knew he knew how to \u003ci\u003eplay\u003c/i\u003e well, just for enjoyment and distraction. Just to allow his mind to decompress a bit and regain its footing.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHe was jamming along to an up-tempo gospel tune when the tape machine (now *that* dates this story, doesn't it?) automatically reached the end of its pause-timer and resumed playing that cattle-rustling scene.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs the story goes, Shaiman looked at the now-unpaused video, and heard the music he was playing on the piano, and the two just… fit. He knew exactly how he was going to score the scene. Copland's ghost was banished (either to a Mexican salon or an Appalachian spring, one supposes), and Shaiman got back to work.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI didn't want to end this month of competition with the cliché about your toughest competition being yourself—there are a whole \u003ci\u003elot\u003c/i\u003e of us composers out there now, and some of us are pretty damned good!

Where we might do better to unclench a bit. Go with the flow. Let it come to us, rather than launching ourselves at it all gung-ho and crazy-eyed.\u003cbr /\u003eWhat I found, after the jump.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca name\u003d'more'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eFirst off,\u003c/b\u003e I find a lot of composers these days (particularly composers who are just getting started) with their fingers on the trigger of the\u0026nbsp;\u003ci\u003espam cannon.\u003c/i\u003e They're just blasting away, firing off demo packages to anyone and everyone who might have an active e-mail account. Filmmakers? Sure. They get demos… but so do music library companies, music supervisors, music editors, studio/network execs, and anyone else whose Hollywood Creative Directory listing seems to touch even marginally on the subject of organized sound waves. There's often little or no follow-through involved—it's all about hitting the maximum number of targets \u003ci\u003eonce\u003c/i\u003e. That, to them, constitutes being a tough, aggressive competitor. But that's not just being overly competitive; it's also competing in the wrong thing.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI receive plenty of these e-mails myself; usually it's from well-intentioned folks who really want to get a foot in a door (mine). The truth of the matter is this: If I don't know you, I'm not going to hire you. And getting to know someone, in my opinion, takes a little time. If the only correspondence we've had is the one e-mail you sent with links to your website and your work—and if that e-mail ends with something like \"please give me a call or an e-mail so that we can discuss how much money you'll be paying me,\" you're pretty much hosed before you even got started. It's a turn-off. You're making me feel like I'm just a sub-boss monster in the video game of your life. And you're gonna blast me with your spam cannon and get onto the next level. I'm not that easy… and neither are most filmmakers.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI like meeting new people, especially music people, and even more especially music people who are \u003ci\u003eon fire\u003c/i\u003e to get their careers going. But a little unclenching in this particular department works wonders. Building relationships takes time… at its best, it happens organically. And trying to force those relationships—looking at them too much like they're something to be shooting your way through, rather than nurturing and enjoying—is, to my way of thinking, over-competitive.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eNext up: gear.\u003c/b\u003e We've talked about GAS (Gear Acquisition Syndrome) around here before, and I freely admit to succumbing from time to time. What I sometimes find, though, is film music pros snapping up a whole new array of toys merely out of a desire to race in the Gear Derby. Again, it's competing in the wrong event.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI'm not suggesting that it's not important to stay up on the latest stuff; it definitely is. But it's a means to an end. And there's a pacing to the thing: it ought to be at a level commensurate with the gigs you're actually getting (and if you simply \u003ci\u003emust\u003c/i\u003e compare and compete, do so with those peers who are at your own level).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI'd love to have a brand spanking new Euphonix or SSL console; who wouldn't? But I don't need it. It's way out of profile with where I am in my career. And the fact that (insert A-lister here) just bought one, or five, or whatever, shouldn't really bear on my decision. If I let it, I'm allowing my urge to compete over my head put the rest of my finances in jeopardy. And that's dumb. I don't need any more machinery to legitimize what I do.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMy take on this: put the blinders on, run your own race, and unclench. When you need gear, get the best you can afford and no more. (it's enough to have to spend just doing that!)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eLast thought for now: \u003c/b\u003eThere are all sorts of aspects of this biz in which thinking of the struggle as a competition can be healthy. It spurs us on to do more than we might be inclined to otherwise. It takes us out of the safe, familiar zone where no growth occurs. It gives us definitive, often-humbling feedback about how we're progressing.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut competing over who can go the longest without sleeping, or who has neglected their family and friends the longest, or even who can write the craziest number of minutes of music in a day?

How do you reconcile that with this career?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca name\u003d'more'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eFirst off, I'm guessing most of you are comfortable taking chances. This career comes with high risk and \u003ci\u003ezero\u003c/i\u003e promise of reward. So the fact that you're interested in composing at all is a pretty reliable sign that you're aware of the gamble. People who are risk-takers generally enjoy tough competition, as well. Generally… but not always.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eRisk and competition are different. Competition implies effort. A lottery ticket is a risk, not a competition—there's nothing you can do, besides buying more tickets, to improve your chances of hitting the right combination of numbers. Whereas, if you fail to land a gig, there's always a nagging guilt, or doubt, that remains: What could I be doing better? Why didn't they like me? Why do I have to do this 'schmoozing and hustling' part—why can't writing incredible be enough?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eToday's column is all about these \u003ci\u003einner-game \u003c/i\u003easpects of the career. It's all about improving what's between our ears, rather than what's coming out of our speakers. It's a subject I want to tackle even more here on SCOREcast, if you're interested. So let me know.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFor now, here's an orientation: some basic techniques for getting through the competitive aspects of the biz, even (especially) if you find them distasteful.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFirst, \u003cb\u003ediscipline\u003c/b\u003e yourself to a positive attitude. Being dejected and cynical is easy. Finding reasons to stay in the game, and to keep a smile on your face as you do it, is much tougher. It is, in fact, a job unto itself. It requires discipline—one of the great unsung commodities of the age we're in. I think discipline is a finite quantity, with each of us possessing a certain intrinsic maximum capacity that is expressed to a greater or lesser extent depending on how we prioritize its usage and constant development. Just like building muscle at the gym, in other words.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt's only a theory, but it seems to line up with my experience, and I definitely feel the burn when I've had to force a little more discipline onto \u003ci\u003emyself\u003c/i\u003e from time to time (usually around deadlines!).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSecond, \u003cb\u003eexpose\u003c/b\u003e yourself to competitive experiences more frequently… and not just in film music. Desensitize yourself through increased exposure, a little at a time. So that un-returned phone call didn't make you feel so great? Make ten more… twenty more. Once you realize that any one failure, any one defeat, isn't the end of the road, you should (should!) be able to breathe a little easier next time.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThird, \u003cb\u003estudy\u003c/b\u003e resources that are proven for other competitive environments. There are books, websites, DVDs that use the same fundamental mental-toughness techniques that top trainers preach day in and day out to the peak-performers in every human endeavor. This technology has actually been developed to a fairly astonishing level—take advantage, be skeptical as required when confronted with some of the ridiculous claims that are out there, and find what works for you. Make a proactive effort to improve, just like you do when you sit down to compose. Work at it.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFinally, \u003cb\u003eunclench\u003c/b\u003e. Accept that there may, in fact, be aspects of this career that aren't your favorite thing in the world. Put in perspective, though, they're actually relatively minor when you compare them to the fact that, even at a middling level of success, millions of people around the world will be hearing the music you create. You're taking your place as one of the people who shapes the artistic reality of the present moment. That's a pretty spectacular reward, and it's one you shouldn't just blow past in some sort of rush to whine about having to get out there and hustle.\u003cdiv class\u003d\"blogger-post-footer\"\u003e\u003cimg width\u003d'1' height\u003d'1' src\u003d'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2957472132698657339-2305918263867029981?l\u003dwww.scorecastonline.com' alt\u003d'' /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"},"link":[{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2957472132698657339/posts/default/2305918263867029981"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2957472132698657339/posts/default/2305918263867029981"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"../../../../../2010/02/weekend-provocation-shrinking-violet.html","title":"Weekend Provocation: Shrinking Violet Edition"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Lee Sanders"},"uri":{"$t":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/08035088236361437862"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$extendedProperty":{"xmlns$gd":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005","name":"OpenSocialUserId","value":"15436834845629676295"}}],"media$thumbnail":{"xmlns$media":"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/","url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hCspY__CLOo/S2jpvrhCDoI/AAAAAAAAAJU/cqGiIbebaZo/s72-c/sanders-provocation-1.png","height":"72","width":"72"}},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2957472132698657339.post-5787380124065652082"},"published":{"$t":"2010-02-05T06:30:00.000-08:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2010-02-05T06:30:00.363-08:00"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"competition"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"demos"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Websites"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"weekend provocation"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"research"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"LHS"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"Weekend Provocation: Who's the Competition?"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003cdiv class\u003d\"separator\" style\u003d\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hCspY__CLOo/S2jihWwJ_TI/AAAAAAAAAJM/TWIelOS2Be8/s1600-h/sanders-provocation-1.png\" imageanchor\u003d\"1\" style\u003d\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"\u003e\u003cimg border\u003d\"0\" src\u003d\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hCspY__CLOo/S2jihWwJ_TI/AAAAAAAAAJM/TWIelOS2Be8/s320/sanders-provocation-1.png\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003eFebruary is a short month—so I'll get right to business. Here's what I want you to be thinking about this weekend:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eWho is your competition?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca name\u003d'more'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt's counter-intuitive, but in a way you face greater competition if you're just starting out than if you're somewhat established. Composers have become like lawyers… with more aspirants in training than practitioners making a living in the field. There are more composers on the D-list than the C-list; more on the C-list than the B-list, and so on. So the number of people targeting that $5,000 indie film is actually greater than the number gunning for the $200 million blockbuster. The major pictures are, of course, a much higher-stakes game, but the players at the table are fewer… especially considering that many of the filmmakers who work at that level already have their composer. C'mon, did you really think anyone but James Horner was gonna score \u003ci\u003eAvatar\u003c/i\u003e?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTaking a look at your \"level\" of gig—and don't get me wrong; I think going for projects that are a \u003ci\u003elittle\u003c/i\u003e over your head can be a good thing, if you approach it as a learning experience and a way to force yourself to stretch!—you can quickly assess the level of craftsmanship, experience, studio resources, etc. that you're likely to be facing in the competition. You can find out, in other words, who the competition really \u003ci\u003eis\u003c/i\u003e. That's something you need to know.\u003cbr /\u003eUse Google, social media of all sorts (searching Twitter is a great way to make some progress here)—seek out a couple dozen of your peers, whether you've ever made their acquaintance or not, and take stock. Figure out who the competition really is for the kinds of gigs you're trying to get. Hell, hit up IMDb and find out who got the gigs you didn't… if you're targeting your own demos appropriately, that alone should give you a pretty good view of the terrain.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOnce you've determined that you're safe (for now) from having to compete with the Williamses and the Elfmen of the world, I recommend doing some \u003cb\u003eopposition research\u003c/b\u003e. We all put our cues on websites to be listened to; it's fair game for you to go and listen.\u0026nbsp;Compare your stuff with the competition.\u003cb\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003ePart One\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eof this technique is to play a couple of cues from several people who are at your level… then play a couple of your own cues. A-B. Back and forth. Be critical: Are you doing as well or better in terms of finished musical product? Chances are you're at least close. Congratulations. But don't get too cocky. Focus on the stuff others are doing better.\u003cb\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003ePart Two\u003c/b\u003e of this strategy is more painful, more humbling, but crucial. Play your stuff, A-B, with the composers at the top of the food chain. Producers don't care that you don't have rooms and rooms full of gear, with small armies of studio underlings, to make everything sparkle. They just want their score to KILL. So A-B yourself with the people you think are absolutely the best in terms of writing chops, production quality, dramatic sensitivity. And draw the appropriate conclusions about where you stand. You might even try specifically writing a few cues for your demo as \"\u003ci\u003ex\u003c/i\u003e-killers\" (where \u003ci\u003ex\u003c/i\u003e is one of your favorite film-score cues by a composer other than yourself). See if you can out-do your heroes. Benefit from the fact that they've already done a lot of the hard work by defining the parameters of the cue. Just be sure to do it in a way that conveys your personality. Filmmakers can smell a Thomas Newman-alike or a John Williams-alike a mile off, and they'll wonder if you have anything original to contribute to their project.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut creating amazing music, as we always emphasize around here, is only a part of the equation. You might do well to re-evaluate yourself as a competitor (my \u003ca href\u003d\"../../../../../2009/06/phases-of-game.html\"\u003eblog entry\u003c/a\u003e on this subject is still available, and this might be a good time to take the quiz, if you haven't already).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eEvaluate the competition, too—see what you like about their websites… their online personalities… the way they're leveraging social media. Then simply do what it takes to make your situation better. Use your own taste and your own resources as a guide.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eDefining exactly who your competition is (by how far along you are, what your network of Industry contacts looks like, etc.) allows you to keep one eye on the fellow members of whatever list you honestly think you're on… and it allows you to keep the other eye on the folks at the top of the heap. Two points… that define the line of your own upward progression in this career.\u003cdiv class\u003d\"blogger-post-footer\"\u003e\u003cimg width\u003d'1' height\u003d'1' src\u003d'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2957472132698657339-5787380124065652082?l\u003dwww.scorecastonline.com' alt\u003d'' /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"},"link":[{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2957472132698657339/posts/default/5787380124065652082"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2957472132698657339/posts/default/5787380124065652082"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"../../../../../2010/02/weekend-provocation-whos-competition.html","title":"Weekend Provocation: Who's the Competition?"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Lee Sanders"},"uri":{"$t":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/08035088236361437862"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$extendedProperty":{"xmlns$gd":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005","name":"OpenSocialUserId","value":"15436834845629676295"}}],"media$thumbnail":{"xmlns$media":"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/","url":"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hCspY__CLOo/S2jihWwJ_TI/AAAAAAAAAJM/TWIelOS2Be8/s72-c/sanders-provocation-1.png","height":"72","width":"72"}},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2957472132698657339.post-8598012459200088984"},"published":{"$t":"2010-01-29T06:30:00.000-08:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2010-01-29T09:07:49.191-08:00"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"weekend provocation"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"collaboration"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"meetings"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Politics"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"communication"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"LHS"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"The Return of Weekend Provocation"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003cdiv class\u003d\"separator\" style\u003d\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hCspY__CLOo/S2I-DFK69NI/AAAAAAAAAJE/wVRNZplI6mw/s1600-h/sanders-provocation-1.png\" imageanchor\u003d\"1\" style\u003d\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"\u003e\u003cimg border\u003d\"0\" src\u003d\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hCspY__CLOo/S2I-DFK69NI/AAAAAAAAAJE/wVRNZplI6mw/s320/sanders-provocation-1.png\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003eIt's good to have a chance to write again, especially on January's final weekend. I've been too busy \"doing the gig\" to talk much about \"getting the gig\" this month. Nice problem, I know… at any rate, here's a quick anecdote, loosely focused on the idea of \"getting the gig,\" to make up for the last few un-Provoked weekends.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca name\u003d'more'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eFrom time to time it's the case that I first meet a filmmaker in the context of trying to land their picture—as opposed to having met them in some other capacity beforehand (and thus already knowing them when it's time to talk about their latest project). I'm reminded what a bad scenario the former case is. Far, far better to have some social interaction prior to that meeting in which you have to sell yourself.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eEither way, though, one thing I recommend avoiding at all costs is \u003cb\u003etalking too much\u003c/b\u003e. I was up for a small picture a few years ago, and had to take a \"cold\" meeting with a pair of producers (I was already friends with the director). The meeting was incredibly tense and awkward… and all the more so because the producers completely stonewalled me.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThey\u0026nbsp;\u003ci\u003eliterally\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;said, like, six or seven words the entire 30-minute meeting. That kind of thing doesn't just happen… it's premeditated. But that didn't occur to me then.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs the silent seconds thundered past… as the director stared in my direction with a hangdog look that told me he wasn't gonna bail me out of this mess, all I could think of was: \"What magical combination of words out of my mouth will cause these people to like me?\"\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI tried to fill the empty air with something, anything—opinions on their script, ideas of how my score would enhance the narrative, a preliminary concept for a palette—but it just got more awkward as they declined to respond. Again and again and again. Finally I was dismissed with a simple \"thanks\" (yes, I'm counting that as one of the six words they said!) and a nod toward the door. I've shown more respect to moldy, back-of-the-fridge lasagna before chucking it in the trash can.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt was one of the most humiliating professional interactions I'd ever had. It took me days to recover. If I'd been able to meet these people socially beforehand, at the very least I would have seen that dynamic in action ahead of time. I could have bowed out of the whole situation gracefully.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCould I have come out with a win? Was there some Jedi sequence of moves that would bring the picture my way? Almost certainly not. In this case, there was no hope for me (see below). \u003ci\u003eV\u003c/i\u003e\u003ci\u003eerbal economy\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;is a best practice regardless, and sometimes it's your only hope of retaining your dignity.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut I hadn't gotten that memo. I just yapped my trap \u003ci\u003ead nauseam\u003c/i\u003e, hoping something would evoke a positive reaction. The better play would have been to let the silence fall, or simply to ask a couple of questions and \u003ci\u003ethen\u003c/i\u003e let the silence fall. Either way, I would have been demonstrating that I was comfortable without words… which would have put the pressure right back on them to say something. Then, if they chose to continue to disrespect me, I could keep control of my part of the equation by walking out without another word. Ending the meeting on my terms, and in a definitive, positive, fashion. That's the strategy I recommend to you should you ever come across this particular brand of negotiator.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt turned out that the pair of producers in this little nightmare anecdote were in the midst of an all-out creative war with the director, so I was never gonna get that gig. Still, the way those producers wrung me out, just to make a point\u0026nbsp;\u003ci\u003eto the director\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;about who was wearing the pants on the production, was asinine. And, after the sting of the insult faded, it was instructive. Now I know what to do when I find myself in one of those rooms (and I imagine you're devising your own clever strategy right about now, too… which is sort of the point).\u003cbr /\u003eIn happier meetings, being concise and focused is still important. It means that the words you do say carry more weight. They allow you to get to the point more quickly. This is a technique I have to work hard to keep at the top of my own mind—I have to be vigilant against my natural tendency toward wordiness. Especially if it's a gig I really want, my tendency is to try to seize control of the situation with words… words… words.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThat's a bad idea, kids. For all kinds of reasons. Over-talking (and its first cousin, \"always having to have the last word in a conversation\") is indicative of weakness, of a lack of self-control, of a feeling that the gig in question is \u003ci\u003eneeded\u003c/i\u003e rather than \u003ci\u003ewanted\u003c/i\u003e.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhich leads me to this: \u003ci\u003e\u003cb\u003eno\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/i\u003e one gig should be everything to you. If it is, you lose any leverage you might ever have in your relationship with the filmmakers. You want to be affable, communicative, intuitive and responsible… but your self-respect demands that you stand up when it's time to walk out of the room. Hopefully the gigs that you land will all be honeymoons, but don't be afraid to use silence every once in a while to protect your turf. And don't be afraid to take your toys and go home if your would-be collaborators are \u003ci\u003etruly\u003c/i\u003e abusive.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere are times when it's not worth getting the gig… and other times when the most useful thing you can do is act for all the world like you don't want it. It's amazing how much respect you can command when you prove you're willing to stare someone down, or even to walk—not out of anger, pettiness or spite, but simply as a matter of self-respect.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI am looking forward to next month's focus—as of Monday, the \u003cb\u003ecompetition\u003c/b\u003e is on, baby.
