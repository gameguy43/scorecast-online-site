It's like we are born with a gear gene or something. Or a sickness... depends on who you ask!<br />
<br />
That's why this month at SCOREcast we are talking all things <b><i>gear and software</i></b>.<br />
<br />
Other than our continued coverage of the Los Angeles composers unionization effort, everything you see at SCOREcast for the month of December will be gear-centric. Suggestions, tips, tricks, hints, warnings, praise, criticisms, and of course... deals (as evidenced by Houston Haynes's <u><i>very</i></u> useful <a href="2009/11/gear-deal-wire-audiomidi-no-brainer.html">post</a> this morning). We've even asked our contributors to weigh in with their Top 3 gear finds and why they like them, and throughout the month we'll be bringing those to you in an ongoing series called "My Perfect 3".<br />
<br />
What are the best new plug-ins? Is platform still an issue in this day and age? What are the differences between the major orchestral libraries out there on the market, and which one should you put on this year's Christmas list? Which tools will make your time at the workstation more efficient? Which tools won't?<br />
<br />
All of these questions are valid when you are just getting your feet wet in this gig, but it is rare to find someone who is willing to listen, let alone... <i>help.</i> (Well, other than that commission-hungry Guitar Center sales associate!).<br />
<br />
So let's hear it, SCOREcasters! We want you to tell us what <i>you</i> want to know. How can we help you with your studios? Are there things about your gear that you don't understand? Are there pieces of gear that you think look interesting, but you are unsure if you should take the several-hundred-dollar plunge?<br />
<br />
With a month-long focus on Gear and Software at SCOREcast, what are <b><i>you</i></b> hoping we cover?<br />

<div id='summary3234609459236927555'><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sw5G2DpAT2I/AAAAAAAAAyc/vmqoErKwOqM/s1600/sig-bellis.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tmmHA-J0MV0/Sw5G2DpAT2I/AAAAAAAAAyc/vmqoErKwOqM/s1600/sig-bellis.png" /></a><b>EVOLUTION</b><br />
There are few if any &#8220;constants&#8221; in our world. The only one Iʼm sure about is <i>evolution</i>. Change. This, then, may be the epitome of an oxymoronic phrase: &#8220;<i>The only constant is change</i>.&#8221;<br />
<br />
This personal wisdom (if indeed it is either personal or wisdom) comes to me at sixty-three years of age. Many things are falling away at this age, but retrospect and derivative knowledge are the offsets. No young person, unless he or she is clairvoyant, can claim this perspective. <br />
<br />
Evolution moves at a glacial pace. It moves like the growth of a tree, like the appearance of facial hair on a prepubescent male. It seems to move slower as our attention spans shorten. Often evolution is imperceptible due to this slow pace until it reaches critical mass. When it hits critical mass, mankind clusters in an effort to speed up evolution. Global warming will be solved, but the progress in alternative energy has, until recently, been glacial. All of a sudden it seems Iʼm not the only one with a ﬁve kilowatt solar array on his property.<br />
<br />
In the big picture, evolution can be viewed as positive, but when broken into shorter periods its effects often seem negative. For example: smoking and obesity. Looking back we can see that acceptance of these lifestyles happened slowly&#8230; until recently, when that &#8220;cluster&#8221; of humanity decided to move these items to the top of the priority list and do something about them.<br />
<br />
These are obvious, in-your-face examples. They affect large numbers of people from a health standpoint as well as a ﬁnancial perspective when you consider the cost of medical treatment for complications from both.<br />
<br />
Our business, the business of creating music for ﬁlm, television, media (and whatever else might come along) is also evolving. By its very nature, our music is designed to be subliminal. It is consequently not in-your-face, and does not affect people as dramatically as cancer or diabetes. Any negative effects resulting from evolution will not easily be noticed. Nor will they motivate clusters of ﬁlmmakers, composers or even audiences to undo what has been done.<br />
<br />
So, what am I saying? What is this &#8220;negative&#8221; evolutionary effect, and what is the cause? Should we do something about it, or will big-picture evolution eventually take care of it as is happening with smoking and obesity?<br />
<br />
It was recently announced that China is contemplating sweeping changes to their higher education system. Apparently they have been teaching a very narrow curriculum, based almost entirely on existing knowledge. This dates back to the early days of communism and the belief that an education concentrated on a speciﬁc skill set, say engineering, would produce the worldʼs best in that particular ﬁeld. What has evolved as a result is a population with extremely good working skills, but without the ability to invent, imagine, probe or discover. It is now speculated that a more liberal education coupled with life experience is imperative to achieve these qualities.<br />
<br />
When I ﬁrst became interested in Film Scoring (circa 1962) there was one book available on the subject: <i>Underscore</i>, by Frank Skinner. That was it. Only years later did <i>Sounds</i> <i>and</i> <i>Scores</i> by <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000049/" rel="imdb" title="Henry Mancini">Henry Mancini</a> hit the market. You could not take a college course on ﬁlm scoring. As a matter of fact, no one could actually tell you how to become a ﬁlm composer. So the &#8220;burning desire&#8221; was sated by merely writing music&#8212;for anything and everything.<br />
<br />
The result of all that writing was a musical vocabulary that was both diverse and personal. It would be the equivalent of the musical vocabulary accrued by the instrumentalist who has played in bands and orchestras from an early age. The other equally important adjunctive skill was working with a plethora of varied personalities. Jazzers, Vegas people, concert promoters, road managers, Top 40 acts, all with different visions and expectations about their music.<br />
<br />
We now have courses in Film Scoring at most major universities. Some even offer a Masters degree in the subject. I had a student begin studying privately with me when he was only 16 years old. This proliferation of&nbsp; possibilities for an education in ﬁlm and media music is the product of supply and demand. In the Sixties there were a handful of ﬁlm composers and that was enough. The process of making ﬁlms was slower (pre-digital, you know), so fewer ﬁlms were made and the tried and true professional composers could not only handle the workload but could prosper doing it.<br />
<br />
Todayʼs ﬁlm composer community is extremely large. The size is reﬂected in all the college courses that have sprung up over the last 10 years. This makes competition keener, and consequently increases the need to start on this educational path as early as possible.<br />
<br />
Compared to concert music, the amount of ﬁlm music available for study is miniscule. Less than a hundred yearʼs worth. And styles of ﬁlm music have changed so radically that, unless you are a history buff, you will likely be listening to examples from the last 5 or 10 years.<br />
<br />
<i><b>Think China! Think variety!</b></i><br />
<br />
There have always been qualitative differences in ﬁlm music, even when there was only a handful of composers. There was good ﬁlm music and not-so-good ﬁlm music, but at least it emanated from the minds (some better equipped than others) of human beings. Human beings, each with a personalized musical vocabulary.<br />
<br />
One of the undisputed technological accomplishments in recent times is what we often refer to as <i>emulation</i>. We write with an <i>emulated</i> orchestra&#8212;an <i>emulated</i> oboe or French Horn. This ability would be categorized as an &#8220;advance&#8221; in technology if it werenʼt for the fact that it is, as we speak, paving the way for&#8212;are you ready?&#8212; <i>EMULATED FILM MUSIC</i>.<br />
<br />
&#8220;It sounds just like ﬁlm music!&#8221;<br />
<br />
I started arranging at the ripe old age of 13. I was NOT a prodigy. I merely had an interest and, more importantly, a father who had been a dance band leader in the 30ʼs and was now a junior high school music teacher. MY junior high school music teacher.<br />
<br />
Hereʼs the thing about the (almost lost) art of arranging: unless youʼre a student, there is NO emulation. Emulation would be anathema to arranging. As an arranger you take an existing song and try your damnedest to put it into a musical genre or setting in which it has never existed previously. This requires imagination. The same imagination that those whom we &#8220;emulate&#8221; have.&nbsp; Technology and the internet have given us the ability to quickly and thoroughly analyze music. We can slow things down and grab every note and glissando in an effort to see what those &#8220;anointed&#8221; among us have done. This is the equivalent of Chinaʼs higher education based on existing knowledge.<br />
<br />
For the gear junkies, or technogeeks, this is the best thing that could happen. It is the very justiﬁcation we need to buy that new library of sounds or those incredible reverbs. The better the sound, the more it sounds just like MUSIC! Whoo hoo!<br />
<br />
Every year, for the past twelve years, I listen to the demos submitted by the top ﬁfty or sixty applicants to the ASCAP Television and Film Scoring Workshop. I know what I hear. There are a few very original works every year, but the majority are, to a greater or lesser degree, derivative. <br />
<br />
This is NO FAULT OF THE EMERGING COMPOSERS WHO SUBMIT!<br />
<br />
&#8220;Then whose fault is it?&#8221; you ask.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Evolution,&#8221; I reply. And, subsequently, is it a &#8220;fault&#8221; at all?&nbsp; Maybe itʼs just the new reality. Entertainment is changing; attention spans are changing. Hell, wars are changing. Governments are changing.<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, Iʼm not sure that there is anything to be done or that there is anything wrong&#8230; except that Iʼm betting you would like to ﬁgure out, in a &#8220;cattle call&#8221; world of media composers, how to get work. How to be noticed in the &#8220;herd.&#8221;<br />
<br />
I used to open my classes with the following question: &#8220;How much money do you expect to make, annually, as a ﬁlm and television composer?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Hereʼs the new question that starts off my class: &#8220;How many of you have: Stormdrum; East/West Gold or Platinum Orchestra; Vienna Symphonic Library Orchestra or Strings; Ivory; Hollywood Strings?&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;If you all have the same sample libraries, (and Iʼm thinking to myself, "&#8230;and are emulating Giacchino, Zimmer, Newton-Howard, Newman and Horner"), what separates you from everyone else?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Now, once youʼre hired, you most likely will be asked to recreate the temp score while circumventing copyright infringement, but, at least in your demos, you have the freedom to be creative and, OMG, maybe even give the ﬁlmmaker an idea that doesnʼt already exist in at least one other ﬁlm.<br />
<br />
When it boils down to merely a price war, no one wins. As I am known to ask, &#8220;How many $5,000.00 projects do you have to get every year to support yourself, your family and your gear while living in LA?&#8221;<br />
<br />
By now you're probably ready to go read something else unless I get to the point, and so I shall.<br />
<br />
The computer is your tool box. You should set aside a period of time&#8212;between the viewing of the ﬁlm, scene or project and the time when you open your tool box&#8212;when the ONLY thing you do is something that can be done with your eyes closed.<br />
<br />
The thing you possess, which no one else possesses, is your musical history of listening and playing. Your likes and dislikes; your musical tastes. These individual aspects of your work may not be perceived by the ﬁlmmaker as important, but they are the very factor that sets you apart from the herd.<br />
<br />
Once you have the job, itʼs never about the music. Itʼs always about the ﬁlm. How you diagnose the dramatic impact of the ﬁlmmakerʼs vision is whatʼs important&#8212;NOT that you use Altiverb or sound just like &#8220;Whomever.&#8221; The determination of what is important to this particular ﬁlm or scene is not inside any library or sequencing software. I feel that the most damaging phrase in contemporary jargon is &#8220;Thatʼs cool.&#8221; Often, my response is &#8220;Very cool. Inappropriate, but very cool.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Put your mind between the project and the computer.<br />

This was followed by a stint with <a href="http://www.pro.imdb.com/name/nm0558922/">Johnny Mathis</a> and ten years of arranging and conducting for several Las Vegas headliners. In 1976, Bellis left the road and began scoring films on a full-time basis. He won an Emmy for the score of <a href="http://www.pro.imdb.com/name/nm0000175/">Stephen King</a>'s <a href="http://www.pro.imdb.com/title/tt0099864/">It</a> and Emmy nominations for HBO's <a href="http://www.pro.imdb.com/title/tt0101766/">Doublecrossed</a> and ABC's <a href="http://www.pro.imdb.com/title/tt0106763/">Double, Double, Toil and Trouble</a>. In addition to his film scoring career, Bellis is past president of the Society of Composers and Lyricists; served on the faculty of the University of Southern California for 17 years, where he lectured in the Scoring for Television and Motion Pictures program; and acts as host/mentor for ASCAP's annual Film Scoring Workshop. </i><i></i><br />

I already have all of these through my Komplete 6 license, but I'm glad to see that they're parting them out for those that only want to add one or two of these monsters to their kit.<br /><br />I have been really pleased with Reaktor and Absynth - the two main reasons that I went for the full Komplete package. However, it's FM8 that has really surprised me. It's *so* much more than an FM synth. Aside from having the ability to create some really twisted sound textures, it's also very CPU-friendly. I'm using it extensively on a project and it continues to amaze with its sound quality and versatility. Anyway, not to sound like a shill for NI - but when something in my kit really "brings the lumber" I can't keep quiet about it.<br /><br />:-)<br /><br />Happy "Synthsgiving" everyone!<br /><br />_____________<br /><span style="font-size:100%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">HOUSTON HAYNES</span></span><span style="font-size:100%;"> <span style="font-style: italic;">was born an raised in the southeastern United States, and moved to Los Angeles in 2003 to pursue a career as a composer</span><span style="font-style: italic;">. </span></span><span style="font-size:100%;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> You can find his SCORECast bio (and links to his other sites) <a href="2009/05/houston-haynes.html">here</a>.</span></span></div>

<div><br />
</div><div>And no matter how much you stare at that blank sequencer page, the notes just aren't forthcoming? And you wonder if you'll ever get that li'l spark of inspiration back..<br />
<br />
How do you get your compositional, creative, musical mojo back if it's gone on hiatus and you're suffering a little <span style="font-style: italic;">'Creative Burnout'?</span><br />
<br />
First: recognise that though you are sadly mojo-less now but that it shall inevitably return again! We've all experienced it from time to time, it's perfectly normal, and there really is light at the end of the tunnel.<br />
<br />
Make time to recharge the juices in your creative batteries and then get back in the game. :-)<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
So&#8230; I was brainstorming ideas for this here topic of creativity and creative processes (of course, Creativity 101 is brainstorming, how else would I start)&#8230; and my research led me to this post:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/essays/33-how-to-survive-creative-burnout/" target="_blank">How to survive creative burnout by Scott Berkun</a><br />
<br />
I cannot tell you how this post resonated with me, an utterly positive experience - a relief.<br />
<br />
<h3>Wake Up Call</h3>I read recently in one of Deane's comments<br />
<blockquote>"Unless your heart is miserable when you are not making music, unless you feel sick to your stomach when you are not composing the music you hear in your everyday life meanderings, please, I beg you... go do something else."<br />
</blockquote><br />
<span style="font-style: italic; text-align: right;">Comment in <a href="2009/11/weekend-provocation-gets-uncomfortable.html">Weekend Provocation Gets Uncomfortable</a></span><br />
<br />
I cannot tell you how that depressed me.<br />
<br />
Because, at that time, I could think of nothing less I'd rather do than sit at the computer and write music.<br />
<br />
Yes. Alarm bells, people. This was not a nice place to be in. Should I go do something else? If the thought of composing was turning me into a grumpy wretch, perhaps now was the time to reevaluate certain life choices.<br />
<br />
I have been composing for as long as I can remember. Even before all the formal training stuff, I've been writing little ditties and improvising on various instruments. It's just something that I like to do. There's always a tune evolving in my head. There's no off switch for that particular radio (bit pschizo I know, but maybe that's what it takes to be creative, eh?).<br />
<br />
Though I don't get the pangs that Deane clearly feels if I'm not composing, I get really ratty if I'm not allowed to write, for whatever reason, for several days in a row. Totally antsy, mean and not very nice to be around. I'm never happier or more energised than when I'm in the flow and composing in the studio.<br />
<br />
It was a gradual feeling that slithered up without me even realising it, but recently I wasn't getting that kick out of the process. And that's why we do it isn't it? Put ourselves through the heartwrenching lows and orgasmic highs to scribe our feelings into music? Because we love it, masochistic types that we are ;-)<br />
<br />
So there was no kick. No nothing.<br />
<br />
But now I'm back in the game. Wooh yeah! It's like I'm 22 again and the music's just flowing.<br />
<br />
So what was this weird blip I experienced? Creative burnout. Sounds a bit yuppy psychobabble but it fits the bill...<br />
<br />
<h3>Toasty</h3><br />
Reading through Scott Berkun's post, I realised that what I was experienced was completely normal, other people go through it, and, more importantly, it's not permanent. I wish I'd found the post a month or so ago, and perhaps the recovery process would have been more expedient, and certainly less worrisome.<br />
<br />
But as it is, I found a way through it, and if this post helps just one of you lovely SCORECast readers avoid the burnout, or (if it's inevitable in your line of work, as I suspect it may be in mine) recover from it faster, perhaps it will have a had a greater purpose.<br />
<br />
Cos it really did suck big time.<br />
<br />
From Scott's article, here are some of the common signs of burnout:<br />
<br />
<blockquote><ul><li>You dread getting up in the morning (unless this is not unusual for you)</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t care anymore about something you were passionate about </li>
<li>You saw the title of this essay and felt a ray of hope</li>
<li>Inspired motivated creative people annoy you</li>
<li>Everything seems gray and pointless</li>
<li>You&#8217;re drinking more or eating more, or showing whatever your signs of depression are</li>
<li>You find it hard to relax</li>
<li>It seems impossible to do basic work you know you&#8217;re capable of</li>
</ul></blockquote><br />
Any of this sound familiar? :-S<br />
<br />
I had gotten to the end of a long series of very cool, but exacting, scheduled projects and had returned home with the idea that now I could work on my own ideas, write something just for me - that perhaps that was the problem, and I just needed to spend a little time composing purely for the sake of it.<br />
<br />
My muse clearly had other plans though. She'd up and left and headed out the country, it seems. Sick of the never-ending requests for inspiration, she was wrung dry, and not best pleased about it.<br />
<br />
So I decided not to fight it.<br />
<br />
This has to be Step 1 in the recovery strategy for Creative Burnout - <i>Acceptance</i>.<br />
<br />
Realise that the only way around is through it. Be ok with it. And go and do something else.<br />
<br />
That's Step 2 - <i>do something else</i>. Don't just wallow in self-loathing and disgust cos the tunes aren't materialising. Do something fun, different, exciting, relaxing. Despite my independent feminist right-on perspectives, I ended up baking cookies, brownies, cakes etc. Yummy, sweet, warming things that maybe weren't so great for the waistline in the long term, but in the short term it was something fun, very different (food prep is my better-half's arena), easy but a little creative, with something physical and real to show for it at the end.<br />
<br />
Maybe that was Step 3 - <i>do something creative but in a different field</i>.<br />
<br />
Then there was all the other practical stuff that would have probably sorted me out eventually had I not done any of the above - I got enough sleep, ate really well (apart from all the cookies), got back into yoga and  met up with friends that I didn't have the chance to previously because of long hours at work and generally being v tired, not exactly life and soul of the party.<br />
<br />
So now it's all good. I'm back on track, and utterly relieved.<br />
<br />
Maybe it is an inevitable part of the Film Composer's life that Creative Burnout looms purely from a result of plumbing the depths of our emotions and processing them with the full extent of our skills, on demand, on a regular basis and to tight schedules.<br />
<br />
Having gone through it I know that if ever happens again, rather than mistaking it for a sign that I should quit the business, I will now recognise it for the temporary, fixable event that it is.<br />
<br />
It's just a little reminder to take a step back and recharge the batteries ready for the next epic score. ;-)<br />

</div><div><br />
<b>Have you ever experienced any of the symptoms of creative burnout?<br />
What strategies got you through to the other side?<br />
What do you do differently in future to avoid it?</b><br />
<br />
All anecdotes and advice strongly appreciated!<br />
<br />
I'm also interested to see how many of us will admit to it. We're supposed to be constantly up, ready to give the project our all, to keep writing into the fourteenth hour and have those creative juices ready and raring to go the next day without fail - is it professional suicide to admit defeat? To realise that you gotta recharge those inspiration batteries once in a while?<br />
<br />
I don't think so&#8230; at least&#8230; I hope not&#8230; ;-)<br />

<div id='summary8852003516592277295'><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SwoZ5ZMjCqI/AAAAAAAAAQQ/282foDgZPfI/s1600/brockmann-scoremixer.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SwoZ5ZMjCqI/AAAAAAAAAQQ/282foDgZPfI/s1600/brockmann-scoremixer.png" /></a>Recording and mixing music is a collection of skills that can take a lifetime to acquire. But almost every composer needs to do their own mixing sometimes, whether for a demo, low-budget project, or other reasons. The equipment keeps getting better and is widely available, especially with the computer software packages most composers work with. Let's take a look at a few ideas and concepts about mixing music for the screen.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting up your studio</span><br />
First of all you need an appropriate place to listen and work. A deep discussion of room acoustics is too much for this article, but for a fantastic resource check out "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Acoustic-Design-Studio-Gallagher-Mitch/dp/159863285X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1258576292&amp;sr=1-1">Acoustic Design For The Home Studio</a>" by Mitch Gallagher. The physical layout and acoustics of the room that you are working in really do make a substantial difference in whether you can accurately hear what is in your mixes.<br />
<br />
To start with, make sure your workstation and speakers are set in a good relation to each other. When you're mixing, you will need to be directly facing the source of the sound, so your screen, keyboard and mouse, and mixing controller or console (if you have one) can't be off to one side. Make sure your speakers are exactly at ear level when you're sitting in your comfortable chair, and that your head and the two speakers form an equilateral triangle. A distance of four to five feet between the speakers and from each speaker to its corresponding ear is usually about right for a personal studio setup. Ergonomics are important; if your arms, hands, shoulders, or back hurt when you work you will never make it through the long career haul, so don't scrimp on a crummy chair or an awkward reach.<br />
<br />
The best way to learn what good mixing really sounds like is to sit right there and listen to a lot of recorded music from a variety of sources, including big-name film scores, as well as pop and classical music. Learn to think about tonal quality and balances; the mix is not the time to think about melody, orchestration, performance, or any other compositional or production details.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mix delivery</span><br />
When you are hired to do a score project, you will ultimately need to deliver the finished individual cues in a single mixed track or group of tracks, usually a computer file such as WAV or AIFF. Bear in mind it would never be right to deliver individual "raw" unmixed tracks &#8212; it is not the filmmaker's job to mix your music on the final audio dub mix, just to balance it with all the other sound elements, dialog, effects, etc. <br />
<br />
Occasionally you may be asked to separate out a melody track or some other part; this is called a "mix stem".  The reason for this is, suppose in the final dub mix the filmmaker feels that a melody might be conflicting against a dialog line, for example. By having the melody on a separate track, this part can be turned down without having to turn down the entire cue. To prepare this, just make your mix as normal, and then record it twice (from the same start place): first all of the music but with the melody switched off, and then that melody track alone (including its reverb, etc.). When you listen to the two stems tracks together with equal levels it should sound just like you intended the mix. (For more about mix delivery, see my article "<a href="2009/09/technical-guidelines-for-film-and-tv.html">Technical Guidelines for Film and TV Scoring &#8212; Part 1</a>".)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mix chain plug-ins</span><br />
Recently I mixed a score for client in his studio computer, and afterwards he asked, why had I removed his "mastering plug-ins" from the master faders? He had previously done rough mixes, and his template included a compressor/limiter and an EQ. To start with, I had to explain what "mastering" means to an engineer:<br />
<br />
Mastering is common in CD album work, and is a final processing step to make all the cuts on a CD sound consistent, and in particular, solve two problems. The first is that a contemporary album may have a number of different producers and engineers, and so the delivered mixes may vary widely in terms of level and EQ (top end/bottom end, etc.). A mastering engineer will use his tools to even things up and make every song match. However, a score mix is more likely to already be consistent in that respect (same engineer and the composer acting as producer).<br />
<br />
The second task in CD mastering is level maximizing, using compression and limiting, in order to make the disc play loud and be "competitive" compared to other CDs. (This is usually demanded by record company people who don't know much about good sound, or that good music can have dynamics.) Film score mixing is different in this respect &#8212; after the music is mixed and delivered then the film has its final "dub" sound mix in which all the sound elements are balanced. I guarantee, the music will NEVER be as loud as the dialog and effects. No matter how much you squash your music mix, that won't have the slightest effect on making your music sound louder in the film soundtrack, or making your mix sound better balanced. <br />
<br />
The filmmaker and the dubbing mixer make the choice of music volume. All pre-processing will get you is to hammer the life out of your music. Think of the dubbing mixer as your "mastering engineer"; he or she can make your music sound its best if you deliver good clean well-balanced mixes. (Tip:  If you do intend to use any mix chain plugins, make sure they are bypassed while you are making your mix, or you will be "chasing your tail", with unintended consequences. And ALWAYS check your mixes with dialog.)<br />
<br />
Also, be wary of pre-canned plug-in presets, both as "mastering chain" and in individual instrument channels. A few years back, there was a popular device called a Finalizer, the misuse of which (imho) did a lot to damage perfectly good mixes and deceive studio owners. It had a menu of presets for rock, classical, jazz, techno, etc., which called up a chain of compressors, limiters, and EQs already set to certain parameters. But think about it: is your Rock mix exactly like every other rock mix that anyone ever created?  Or, whatever style. The preset settings that might be appropriate for one example of a style are completely inappropriate for another example of similar style. There are simply too many variables that can go into production and mixing.<br />
<br />
Plug-in presets are available in all the computer DAWs as well. For example, recent versions of Logic have these sorts of effect chains, in the "Library". These are intended to take the mystery out of engineering for folks who don't know much about it. But, watch out! Just like timing a scene or writing for the violin, there's no excuse for not taking the time to really learn and understand how the tools of recording work, in order to get the most out of them. <br />
<br />
In all the skills that go into creating great-sounding and competitive music, the more you know the better it will sound. And, best, your music will improve and you will know exactly why.</div>

<div id='summary2787978381666124593'><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SwpujRbCryI/AAAAAAAAAQY/NHpW0gNmdHU/s1600/sig-ogden.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SwpujRbCryI/AAAAAAAAAQY/NHpW0gNmdHU/s1600/sig-ogden.png" /></a>Across the film music industry, the recent composer unionization effort has been at the forefront of everyone's mind for the last few weeks. Led by film composers Bruce Broughton, James DiPasquale, Alan Elliott, and Alf Clausen, the Teamsters Local 399 has offered a hand as one of the most powerful union organizations to help unionize composers &#8212; one of the last creative groups in Hollywood to still work without a collective bargaining agreement.<br />
<br />
Since the announcement of this effort, there have been many opinions expressed, a lot of intense debate and discussion, and a load of mixed emotions on all fronts.<br />
<br />
I've <a href="2009/11/composer-unionization-more-questions.html">mentioned before</a> that I am yet undecided on the issue. To be honest, I've enjoyed the conversation and I've been like a sponge, soaking up everyone's viewpoints on the subject. I've been an insatiable reader of online opinions on the union issue and have also done my own homework to be sure that when I decide which way is best for my own career, I can make an informed and thoughtful decision. <br />
<br />
There is, however, a significant voice that is missing from the conversation &#8212; something that I've relied on all my life to aid me in my decision making process: <b><i>The voice of leadership</i></b>.<br />
<br />
I know that in many careers, including my own, the whisper of seasoned leadership has been vital in helping to make informed decisions. Few influencers can sway a personal choice more than the experience and counsel of a seasoned veteran who has seen it all and done even more. The film music industry is chock full of veteran composers who have not only witnessed decades of change and transformation in our business (and adapted successfully to those changes), but have also been through the wars politically with directors, studios, agents, soundtrack labels, and yes... unions.<br />
<br />
So where are they? Where are the voices of our Generals that we as the "foot soldiers" of the film music army have come to rely on for everything else that we've pondered career-wise &#8212;&nbsp;from what plug-ins to spend our money on to how to best break into the industry? Why are the "heavies" not weighing in publicly on an issue that could potentially be the most important critical argument toward the sustenance of our beloved craft to come down the pike in twenty years?<br />
<br />
If you were in attendance at the Teamsters information meeting that took place on November 16, it was obvious that the majority of composers coming out to represent the community as a consensus were extremely young. While there were a handful of what most would call "A-List" veteran composers in the audience, most folks in the seats were either emerging or beginning composers well under the age of 40. Arguably, accessible technology combined with an over-saturation of scorable media has provided the impetus for a formerly older gentleman's game to give way to a trade more available to younger men and women over the course of the last ten years or so.<br />
<br />
To me, a severe irony exists in the absence so-far of vocalized opinion or comment from any recognized composer. For a group of people traditionally known to be somewhat introverted, to witness a gathering of over 450 of us in one room is a little of an accomplishment. To see five or ten of our more respected and recognized composers in attendance is also a surprise, again, given the way in which we composers don't like to "come out of the cave". But to some, this was important enough to attend, consequences be damned (and I'm sure there *were* some the next day!).<br />
<br />
I'd like to hear from those people. I'd like them to speak up and address us <i>foot soldiers</i>, whom, make no mistake, will be the initial base on which this proposed union will be built. After all, there is much more responsibility to being a composer than simply writing great music. There <i>is</i> a community at stake. A community that they are not only a part of, but certainly helped build. A community of young composers that is proud of their leaders' accomplishments, but also looks up to them for their experience, wisdom, and candor in speaking of the craft. They had me at their music, but Messrs. Broughton, Clausen, and DiPasquale have all stepped up to the plate and swung the bat to start a conversation, earning them even more respect and admiration from me. This is exactly the kind of leadership I am talking about. Now it is time for the rest of our legacy composers to step out of the shadows of Hollywood politics and shed some light on both sides of the union argument for the betterment of the community and the craft.<br />
<br />
Here is why I believe this is necessary:<br />
<br />
As much as the newer, younger generations of composers are gung-ho and ready to tackle the pros and cons of unionization, I am certain &#8212; as it is simply a byproduct of the human condition &#8212; that lack of experience, limited perspective, and the simple awkwardness of youth <i>will</i> have a negative affect on how smooth a ride this could be. I saw it at the meeting on the 16th, and we've all seen it in hundreds of other life experiences. For those of you that are familiar, the story of the "old bull and the young bull" comes to mind.<br />
<br />
The harsh reality is that the majority of film composers have never worked within the motion picture studio system. The argument that studios are controlling less and less of the movie business as days go by is an argument that, factually, does not hold water, which is why you often hear veteran composers counseling beginners to "move to Los Angeles". True, there are independent productions that have seen great success in the last fifteen years, but the majority of work in film that can sustain the career of a working film composer still originates at the Hollywood studio level. Even with the iron-clad film music education that a first rate university can provide these days, young composers are simply not adequately prepared to deal with the needs and desires of a major Hollywood studio from a business standpoint. The art of handling the nuances of multi-million dollar studio music budgets is not something that can be easily learned in a classroom setting, nor would a studio saddle a first time composer with such an unfair expectation.<br />
<br />
I would suggest that the majority of composers in the room on November 16th haven't the foggiest clue what a collaboration with a major studio feels, looks, or tastes like. They have never had to work up a package deal to be approved by a music department, nor have they ever encountered the prickly situation of a director requesting the production and orchestral recording of alternate cues that were not included on the package agreement to begin with. Beginning composers simply do not have the perspective necessary to see anything from the studio's vantage point, and to put it plainly... many won't for some time. Even the most experienced independent composers have yet to walk the tightrope of artistic integrity and serving the needs of a major studio's budgetary guidelines and business parameters &#8212; both of which require careful attention in order to bring about a fruitful collaboration at the blockbuster level.<br />
<br />
Anyone who now works or has worked with a studio will tell you that the unionization of composers poses far greater ramifications for both sides than it does at the independent level. At the studio level &#8212; which is where most of us would like to be, don't forget &#8212; unionization poses a wholly different set of hurdles and obstacles, and means a lot more than just whether or not composers "get the respect" we deserve. In fact, I would bet my next royalty check that most studio-level composers didn't attend last week's meeting simply because it would have been a waste of their time. The fact is that the problems that haunt "A-List" composers are a far cry from the issues that haunt beginners. The day-to-day issues of studio-level composing under a composers union are those that would ripple the pond in far greater and potentially more dangerous ways than a beginning composer could ever pretend to imagine.<br />
<br />
This is precisely why we need more recognized composers speaking out on the issue of a potential composers union. The silence of wisdom and experience serves to only make the natives more and more restless. Of course, there could be good reason for silence from A-listers, the first being the importance of maintaining alliances with the studios. Even still, there are ways to speak on this issue without jeopardizing business relationships, and it seems to me like many of those A-list composer/studio relationships are now galvanized to the point where not much damage could be done by simply sharing a healthy conversation.<br />
<br />
I would like to openly invite any recognized composer to weigh in on the issue of unionization here at SCOREcastOnline.com. Please feel free to log into the COMMENTS below and voice your opinions, address any issues you feel are ambiguous on either side of the argument, or simply encourage the younger set out there to get more involved in the exploration of the possibilities. Just knowing that you all are engaged would help those of who want to be engaged feel a lot better about... well... engaging.<br />
<br />
Your music has helped move us all through some of life's most difficult challenges. That music came from your own filtered perspective on your lives and success. Now, more than ever, we need unfiltered access to that life experience to help move us through an issue that will most certainly effect all of us one way or another.<br />
<br />
We anxiously await your response.</div>

</div><br />
<br />
I'll be honest - I've only been composing a relatively short while in comparison to a lot of other composers on here, so I don't think that my creative process is in anyway matured - its probably all over the place and changes every time I create a score, or even music in general. I believe that I don't have enough experience in composing yet, to think about my own creative process and see what it looks like, so while I was thinking about what to write about in this article, I started looking into the psychological side of the creative process, and look at some literature on the subject.  I think the actual reasoning behind <span style="font-style: italic;">why</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">how </span>your brain does something c<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></span></span></span>an be a real eye opener in some topics of conversation, and I think its the case here also.<br />
<br />
Do "successful" people have the same creative process, or does it change from person to person, and even project to project.   As I was searching for information on the psychological aspects of creativity, I came across an interesting article on "Creativity Models" and the literature that has been written on them in the last century.  One creativity model that caught my eye was that of <a href="http://www.robertfritz.com/">Robert Fritz</a> in 1991.<br />
<br />
Fritz wrote about a  model called the "Process for Creation" (PFC) which reflected the stages in creative thinking, and creativity.  These steps are found below:<br />
<div style="text-align: left;"><b>- Conception</b><br />
</div><div></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>- Vision</b><br />
</div><div style="text-align: left;"></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>- Current reality</b><br />
</div><div style="text-align: left;"></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>- Take action</b><br />
</div><div style="text-align: left;"></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>- Adjust, learn, evaluate, adjust</b><br />
</div><div style="text-align: left;"></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>- Building momentum</b><br />
</div><div style="text-align: left;"></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>- Completion</b><br />
</div><div style="text-align: left;"></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>- Living with your creation</b><br />
</div><div style="text-align: left;"><b><br />
</b><br />
</div>I looked at the model and wondered - "does this reflect the process of composers while scoring for a film or even when creating music for any type of media/medium".  Below is my thoughts on how this creative process model works in relation to scoring - maybe your thoughts on it will be different - let me know!<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Conception </span>- </span>"<span style="font-style: italic;">Something conceived in the mind; a concept, plan, design, idea, or thought</span>"<br />
You're handed the film, and watch it tens of times over. In your mind you start to hear sounds, musical lines, instruments etc. over different scenes and start to get a rough idea of what you'll be doing for the score (varying degrees of roughness ranging from "I haven't a clue" to "I know exactly what I want to do here")<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Vision</span> - "<span style="font-style: italic;">The manner in which one sees or conceives of something</span>"<br />
You have a rough idea of what you want, next is something that I have read about a lot, and tried a number of times - it applies to all areas of creativity, and even goal setting.  You have to <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> (or hear) the end result.  You have to be able to imagine the finished product as though its right in front of you - know how it sounds, feels, looks.  The more vivid your vision of the end product or goal, the more likely you are to be able to make it a reality.  I read an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming">NLP</a> book once by Tony Robbins where he describes how he asked a number of successful people how they saw their goals.  He said that all of those people were able to literally feel, smell, touch and hear their goals - they were able to sit in the ferrari they wanted, and know the smell of the leather.  That strong vision of the end goal made it more real for them, and a lot easier for their brain to process just <span style="font-style: italic;">how </span>to make it happen for them.  Long story short - having a strong <span style="font-style: italic;">vision</span> of your end goal helps your brain to figure out what needs to be done in order to reach that goal.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Current Reality</span> - "<span style="font-style: italic;">Determining the availability of the tools and expertise required to complete the job</span>" (my definition at least!)<br />
You have a vision of the end result - you know what it is going to sound like (either a rough or detailed idea) - but you have to figure out what tools are required to complete the job.  Things to be taken into consideration are time, software, money, talent, relationship with director (does he like your idea?) etc.  For example, your vision of the score is of a beautiful symphonic piece scored on the Newman Scoring Stage with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra (not sure why they'd be in the US, but you never know!).  Of course unless you're a multmillionaire and know a lot of people to pull the strings, this isn't become reality, and if you continue to try and pursue this goal, it will most likely end in tears.  You need to evaluate the tools available to you, and determine if your vision of the score can become a reality, for example, within the confines of your schedule.  If it can't, then you need to re-evaluate the vision, and sculpt it to suit the reality.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Take Action</span> - "<span style="font-style: italic;">Just do It! (Nike)</span>"<br />
I don't think we need to go into great detail here do we? Probably the hardest of all the stages of creativity - actually doing it. Deliberation is a great killer at this stage, aswell as a short attentio...what was I saying? You know what you want at this stage, you know you can do it - just do it! :)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Adjust, Learn, Evaluate, Learn </span>- "<span style="font-style: italic;">To gain knowledge, comprehension, or mastery of through experience or study</span>"<br />
This, in my opinion, is where the director enters the picture once again - you show him/her your mockup of the score and get some feedback. You run back to the cave with the feedback from the director, and compose compose compose. You learn from the feedback, from the numerous hours of composing put in during the project (where you might learn new tricks, ideas, tips etc.) and from the whole experience of working on a film score.  I think subconciously, no matter what task you are doing, you brain evaluates for you, and you'll most likely remember the next time you do that task, what worked, and what didn't.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Building Momentum </span>- "<span style="font-style: italic;">Impetus of a nonphysical process, such as an idea or a course of events</span>"<br />
The score is due in 14 hours, and you've already been at it for a straight 12 hours today.  We all know that feeling of impending doom - its in those last few hours that you'll get some of your best work done in my experience.  Everyone is different, but I know I am one of those people who loves a nice deadline far away, but will only do the work once I start to realise "oh crap...its like due in less time than I have to do it!". (its a trait I'm working on!).  Its a nice feeling though being on on a roll, with the music flowing out of you like a runny nose on a winter's day!  In the process of a film score, for a composer, a lot of things happen at this stage I think.  You're preparing to get a live recording done (if you have the budget), you're sending off your music to the orchestrator/copier etc. It all starts to come together and you get mixed feelings of "I can see the end" and "oh dear god, I hope this works!"<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Completion</span> - "<span style="font-style: italic;">The act of finishing or the state of being completed</span>"<br />
Relax, the work is done. Get some sleep, see your girlfriend, open the curtains and let the sunlight in for the first time in how long?<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Living with your Creation </span><br />
This is an interesting part of the process that Fritz included, and I've been thinking about it most of the day today.  In the last 1 or 2 years, I've interview a number of composers, ranging from amateur to professional, and asked them all the same question - "<b style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;">Do you find that when you&#8217;ve finished a cue/score/track, you&#8217;re sick of hearing it</b>?".  You'd be suprised the range of different answers I've received - from "<span style="font-style: italic;">I can't stand listening to it</span>" to "<span style="font-style: italic;">Yes of course! I love it!</span>".  I think being happy with your creation is quite an important part of the creativity process - perhaps even one of the most important parts in the long term.  If you're not happy with what you've done, and you can't stand back and go "Yea...this is awesome, and <span style="font-style: italic;">I </span>created it", then in my opinion you won't be happy with yourself and your ability to do the work in the future. Sure we've all done some crappy work at some stage of our lives, but you can at least see the potential in what you've done, and be happy with that at the very least.<br />
<br />

Tell me in the COMMENTS what <span style="font-style: italic;">YOU </span>think about this model - total codswallop or bang on target?<br />

The problem gets even tougher when the music we write has to function as one part of a larger storytelling machine.<br />
<br />
True to the name of this column, I'm going to give you a real View from the Trenches this month&#8230; outlining some of the problems and pitfalls I've encountered over a few (OK, more than a few) years of doing the thing. And maybe together we'll come up with some techniques that will get you past the toughest spots.<br />
<br />
So, in no particular order:<b>&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
<b>The Blank Canvas.</b><br />
<div>I don't know about you, but I feel a little moment of panic every time I start a new cue. In a way that's a good thing. It means I'm not taking the job for granted. And usually I'm past it fairly quickly&#8230; I've learned to trust my instincts (or at least give 'em a fair chance). But if I stare at that blank canvas for too long, I start not wanting to be in the studio. My mind drifts. Surely there are other things I could be doing that would be more productive&#8230; more fulfilling&#8230; more fun than just sitting here, burning my retinas with monitor-glare.<br />
<br />
The trick is to take tiny little steps at first, if that's what it takes to get notes on screen (or on paper, if that's how you work). Almost any little fingertip-hold on the cliff you're about to scale will get your feet off the ground&#8212;and that's all it usually takes to get you started.<br />
<br />
A related problem sometimes occurs when I take an ear-break (composer code for "I can't sit here for one more minute without throwing something through the screen"). The same problems, the same bad notes, the same controller information needing to be entered&#8212;it's all going to be there when I get back. And it accumulates a sort of inertia while I'm gone. It's always tougher to resume my place (mid-cliff, as it were) if I've stepped away before tending to something big that needs fixing.<br />
<br />
Likewise, I create a potential problem for myself if I step away at the end of a phrase. This sounds weird, but I've had many experiences, some of them as recent as last week, where I create a single phrase or idea that I like a lot&#8230; I flesh it out as fully as I can imagine it&#8230; then take a break, thinking I'll pick up right there later. And, later, I'm stuck. I don't know where to take the damned thing. I attribute this in part to abandoning the chair at the crucial moment.<br />
<br />
The takeaway here: be careful about interrupting your process, especially starting off a cue. Don't get too far outside your own head. And stay on the cliff a little longer than you're comfortable.<b>&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
<b>The Shiny New Thing.</b><br />
</div><div>I mentioned this in the comments over the weekend&#8212;it's possible to get so carried away with a new sound, or a new piece of processing gear, that you lose the original intent of the cue. The music you're working on becomes an exploration, a test-drive of the Shiny New Thing.<br />
<br />
We spend good money, and lots of it, on these new additions to our arsenal. It's important to know their capabilities, strengths and limitations. But you have to be careful to set aside time for that when you're not serving another imperative (i.e., scoring to picture). Simple as that.<br />
<br />
To continue our "cliff" metaphor, this one is like finding a cool new set of handholds that may or may not lead you <i>up</i>. And up is where you have to go, before your strength runs out. Stay focused.<b>&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
<b>The Troublesome Collaborator.</b><br />
</div><div>Nothing saps your will to live&#8212;OK, maybe that's an overstatement, but if you've been there, you know&#8212;like the filmmaker who wants seventeen versions of a cue. It's not just the extra work. Coming up with yet another solution to the same problem, and another and another and another, does something to our confidence. It makes us mistrust our instincts. It makes us question our creative process itself.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong: If your score isn't getting it done, you need to own that and make adjustments. Kill your favorite cue, if that's what it takes (although maybe you'd do better to file it away for yourself, for later!). The bigger the project, the truer it is that the filmmakers <i>will</i> get the score they want. Maybe not from <i>you</i>, but they'll get it from someone.<br />
<br />
My only advice here is to remind yourself that this is all normal. Everyone goes through this at some point. Don't let an annoyance become a self-fulfilling prophecy&#8230; the stress of worrying about falling off the cliff causes your palms to become sweaty, which causes you to slip&#8230; oops. Bottom line: content is not process. Problems with the former do not necessarily indicate problems with the latter. Just keep it in mind.<b>&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
<b>The Transition from Hell.</b><br />
</div><div>Seriously, what's the deal with transitions? I've mentioned it here before, in my article on workflow: You're cruising along for bars at a time, when suddenly you're mired down. Unable to get from Point A to Point B (which you're already hearing, fully-formed, in your head). And you know the director is gonna bust you for that ham-handed excuse of a modulation you're floating at the moment.<br />
<br />
This cliff metaphor I started out with is making even me roll my eyes at this point, but I'm sticking with it. And here it's so <i>obvious</i>: You're on a path, and you see where it continues, about five feet over and three feet up&#8212;but you can't figure out how to get there.<br />
<br />
What to do? I'm no rock climber, but my guess is that there's a whole batch of special techniques for handling exactly this kind of situation. Sometimes you'll see those maniacs fling themselves across empty air, only to land exactly where they wanted. Controlled chaos. Other times they'll do some crazy upside-down contortion, starting from an unlikely body position in order to end up properly. It all relates here as well, and we have the advantage that <i>no rule is permanent</i> (unlike on the cliff, where&#8230; you know&#8230; gravity).<br />
<br />
So&#8212;first, check your <i>premises</i> at the transition. You can dump any and all of them, as long as it makes your ears happy. And sometimes dumping something you thought you needed is the kind of freeing move that will get you through. If Point B is where you're determined to go, you can get there. I pretty much guarantee it. Even if you simply start playing different music. The brain has an incredible ability to connect things that at first don't seem related. In a worst-case scenario, do what my mentor, Ron Jones, once recommended to me: write a drum solo.<b>&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
<b>The Impossible Mandate.</b><br />
</div><div>Our creative process thrives on constraints. We predicate our writing on&#8230; something. Usually that's a set of cohesive rules we have devised (consciously or not) for making the score convey meaning in as precise a way as we can muster.<br />
<br />
But sometimes we're asked to reconcile multiple sets of ground rules. Or multiple stylistic demands. Or creativity collides with plagiarism ("&#8230;just copy the temp" being the words one typically hears in such a situation).<br />
<br />
All these are examples of starting from a place on our rock wall where there simply <i>isn't</i> a pathway to the top. Once again, you have to check your premises, or those of your creative partners. Start from somewhere different, if possible, or go find another rock to climb. Usually, if you're tactful enough about it, you'll find that the filmmakers already know that what they're asking you to do is fatally flawed. And then, with that concession in hand, you can work together on coming up with a solution. If not&#8230; there are always more rocks to take on. No reason to fall just for the sake of falling.<b>&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
<b>The Immovable Deadline.</b><br />
</div><div>Some people will tell you that it's an absolute: the more time we have to compose, the better the final product. I think it's true&#8230; but only to a point. Personally, I need deadlines. I'm my own worst taskmaster, but I respond well to fear. And nothing streamlines my creative process, nothing forces me to trust my instincts and write fast and loose, better than a tough deadline.<br />
<br />
Sometimes the result is, at least to my ears, unpolished. I'll give you that. But the occasional immovable deadline&#8212;of the variety that drives us to the coffeepot&#8212;acts as a confirmation. It proves the fundamental soundness of our creative process, our organizational structure, our team of personnel. It's a crucible.<br />
<br />
Getting through it is a confidence-builder. It's a potent, concentrated form of the rush that keeps us all coming back to the studio in the first place.<br />
<br />
By the way, I call this the "immovable" deadline, rather than the "inconvenient" or "arbitrary" or "sassy" deadline, because most deadlines can be begged into oblivion. Some can't. You will find out which is which.<br />
<br />
My advice: take it as a challenge. Call in your team, your colleagues, your composer-heroes, and crush that sucker mercilessly. And charge the client accordingly.<br />
<br />
If there are any other pitfalls that come to mind&#8212;especially if you have some good techniques for getting past them&#8212;put 'em in the COMMENTS, below. I would love to add some new chops to my own creative process, courtesy of SCOREcasters like you. So bring it.<br />

<div class='post-body'>
<div id='summary8999744790468974566'><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SwMipVLdMJI/AAAAAAAAAQA/gy4W5LwPA4M/s1600/sig-ogden.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_62a7ft-uZow/SwMipVLdMJI/AAAAAAAAAQA/gy4W5LwPA4M/s320/sig-ogden.png" /></a>Last night in Burbank, approximately 435 people from the film composing community turned out for the Composers Unionization information meeting that was hosted by the Teamsters Local 399, and moderated by composers Jim DiPasquale, Bruce Broughton, Alf Clausen, and Alan Elliott. Teamsters union rep Steve Dayan was also on hand to answer questions about the proposed Teamsters/Composers relationship.<br />
<br />
Online, in print, and in the private circles of our community, there is no shortage of opinions on this issue, and in some cases the battle lines have already been drawn. Up to now, I have personally held off on making my own ruminations public or offering my own opinions on this issue of composer unionization. In addition, the values that were the impetus for me creating SCOREcast in the first place have also motivated me to stay temporarily neutral in an effort to help to facilitate a complete and all-encompasing conversation amongst this community. I've tried to keep my comments as unbiased and as neutral as possible - mostly because in anticipation of last night's meeting, we didn't know anything about what was being proposed, but also because I simply felt I didn't know what the right answer was.<br />
<br />
I'm still not sure I do, and so I'm still willing to listen. However, while theoretically the idea of a composers union sounds like a swell idea &#8212; and one that is arguably long overdue &#8212; unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at things), last night I came away with more questions than answers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>ISSUE #1:</b> The mantra of the panel, and especially that of Steve Dayan, the Teamsters representative, was that unionizing under a collective bargaining agreement was simply "The Right Thing to Do". We heard several times that "it is not about money, it is not about prestige, it is simply the right thing to do".<br />
<br />
<b>My Question:</b> Why is it the "right thing to do"? Nobody ever followed that statement up with a hard argument as to the "righteous" need for a union. If it is the right thing to do, then why did I feel string-armed the second I walked through the door, signed -in, and was handed a "yellow" card (Teamsters representation authorization cards)? Add to that, we were all told several times during the meeting that those cards were "only to obtain information. Fill them out if you want, but you do not need to."<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>ISSUE #2:</b> The panel stated numerous times that they've been working on this proposal to bring to the community for four years now. They explained that they've had "plenty of time" to explore and analyze all options, and that the Teamsters is the clear choice in organizing composers.<br />
<br />
<b>My Question:</b> Why then did the panel seem so ill-prepared for several of the attendees' most basic questions about numbers and constituency? When asked by an "A-list" composer last night what they would define as "critical mass", none of the panel members could answer. In fact, several of them actually looked at one another as if to say, "I was under the impression there'd be no math during this debate!" After four years of intensely scrutinizing all of the angles to composer unionization, I would have thought the questions of "How many legitimate working composers are there now?" would be a fairly simply data point to produce to the attendees.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>ISSUE #3:</b> Steve Dayan mentioned more than once that "agents, managers, and producers are against this, and will fight it with everything they have."<br />
<br />
<b>My Question:</b> Has anyone asked those people what they think? It's too convenient to ask those people to all "leave the room", and then talk about them as if they are the enemy. I happen to <i>like</i> the people I've enjoyed collaborations with over the years. They have become friends &#8212; friends that want to see me succeed as much they strive for success themselves. To vilify the very people responsible for giving us the majority of our work seems like getting started out on the wrong foot.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>ISSUE #4: </b>Steve Dayan also made a comment on the heels of an attendee's (mistaken) suggestion that there weren't "many A-list composers here". Dayan said that the organization effort cannot start at the "<i>top</i> of your industry. It has to start with <i>you guys</i>."<br />
<br />
<b>My Question: </b>Why do the people who are trying to break into the business have to be the ones to shoulder the cost for something that the previous generation has been 100% content to abide with all these years? If unionization is "the right thing to do" (See issue #1 above), wouldn't ANY composer &#8212; no matter what stage they are at in the game &#8212; put on the war paint, damn the torpedoes, and come out in support of such a righteous cause? We look at those men and women as our leaders &#8212; our Generals. If they don't love the craft enough to stand for change, then as those who look up to them, why should we? (As a personal aside, it has already been reported across the internet on several sites, so I don't mind repeating it here: Chris Young, Mike Post, Rick Marvin, Lisa Coleman, Danny Lux, Ed Sheamur, Richard Bellis, George Clinton, and several other "A-list" composers attended this meeting. I'm sure they all have a lot going on in their schedules. But they were there last night.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>ISSUE #5: </b>The panel framed their enthusiasm for a union with the Teamsters around the fact that the Teamsters were able to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement for casting directors four years ago in Hollywood.<br />
<br />
<b>My Question: </b>Why is this accepted as an "apples to apples" comparison? Wouldn't a more appropriate comparison be "actors and composers" or "writers and composers"? The writers have a union &#8212; it's called the WGA (which, by the way, we were told doesn't want to deal with us composer-types!). Casting directors are responsible for "casting" a cast. Composers don't cast anything... we GET cast. We ARE the cast. We are the <i>musical cast</i> of the show. So, that analogy doesn't hold water.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>ISSUE #6: </b>While we are on the subject of <i>casting directors</i>, there was a gentleman that was there to speak from the perspective of the casting directors, and he had a few nice things to say. One of those things was, "All that casting directors were looking for was some recognition and medical and pension benefits."<br />
<br />
<b>My Question: </b>Really? That's it? Okay... then maybe we ARE comparable groups of people, because since the panel made it clear that minimums are simply "a floor, and you will be able to negotiate a higher rate if you'd like", then all that is really left IS medical, pension, and recognition by the NLRB. Sweet!<br />
<br />
So, with that then, here is what I propose: Since I already pay dues to a great organization called "The Society of Composers and Lyricists" (which I found out last month at their membership meeting is now comprised of over 3,000 members), why doesn't the SCL just take out a group health plan that would cover all of those people? I'm pretty certain if there had been a Blue Cross/Blue Shield rep at the meeting last night, he/she would have had to try and keep the saliva from dripping out of the corners of his/her mouth.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong &#8212; last night was incredible. As someone who is in absolute love with this community, I was overjoyed, not only by the attendance of this meeting but also by all of the views expressed. I'm sure that this is only one of many conversations that will be had over the next several months &#8212; maybe even years &#8212; about this issue. My only hope is that people do not get amped up about belonging to "a cause," but rather, with skeptical optimism, carefully weigh out the long-term pros and cons of such a major decision.<br />
<br />
What we need more than anything, rather than jumping on a bandwagon, is a more robust discussion. I openly invite anybody on the AMCL steering committee, or any studio people (producers, directors, heads of music, etc.) to grant an interview to SCOREcast to address these issues.<br />
<br />
As for the rest of you: SPEAK. TALK. QUESTION. COMMENT.<br />

I sincerely hope to see many of you TONIGHT for a meeting that could very well prove to be the early beginnings of a union for film music composers.<br />
<br />
If you are unable to make the meeting, keep your browser pointed here at <b><i>SCOREcastOnline.com</i></b>. We will be setting up a special section tonight where you'll be able to get all of your unionization news in one spot.<br />
<br />
The Readers Digest condensed version of what's happening is that the newly formed Association of Media Composers and Lyricists (AMCL), led by composers <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0165299/" rel="imdb" title="Alf Clausen">Alf Clausen</a>, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005976/" rel="imdb" title="Bruce Broughton">Bruce Broughton</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006038/">Jim DiPasquale</a>, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1410756/">Alan Elliot</a>, have announced that they have been researching the possibility of affiliating with the Teamsters union with the goal of creating a collective bargaining agreement that would organize film composers under a union.<br />
<br />
To read my article which followed the initial announcement from a few weeks ago, click <a href="2009/10/composers-to-unionize.html">here</a>.<br />
<br />
I've received too many emails and private Facebook messages to count asking me to articulate my feelings about composer unionization on SCOREcastOnline.com, but I feel that it would be premature for me to do so at this time. We just simply don't know enough yet. That being said, I have a ton of questions that I want answers to tonight at the information meeting in Burbank, and I hope that you do too.<br />
<br />
No matter what your feelings are on this issue, there are too many pros and cons to the argument of composer unionization for you to not be asking questions. Regardless of the outcome, you can be certain that your business as a film composer WILL be affected one way or another, pending this effort.<br />
<br />
That is why we are urging everyone in our composing community to attend the information meeting being held TONIGHT in Burbank at the Pickwick Gardens Conference Center. If you are in the Los Angeles area, Lee and I will both be in attendance, along with several of our regular SCOREcast contributors, and we'd love to hook up with you there.<br />

Settle in properly, then re-acquaint yourself with the two implements you're allowed for this exercise: your pencil and your score paper (OK, if you need it, you can have something like a clipboard to write on&#8212;it's not a test of your penmanship under duress, after all).<div><div>You want to face the truth, even if it's ugly. I mean <i>really</i> ugly. You want to know: How integral to your creative process is all that gear? How big a crutch; how much of a limitation? What could you do without it?

Let us know how it went&#8230; no need to post anything (after all, you're not even in the studio!), but it would be interesting to hear whether it was a struggle, or surprisingly easy, or somewhere in between.</div><div>My hunch? This one is gonna cause some tears. And a lot of tempos set to 60 and 120 bpm.</div><div><br /><div><br /></div></div></div></div></div>

It's something that I have been asking myself lately, as I navigate through my latest score project, and it's something that I think you have to regularly ask yourself in order to stay fresh, although we probably don't ask it enough.<br />
<br />
It's a simple question.<i><b> What makes you different?</b></i><br />
<br />
Tell me the <i><u>one</u></i> thing that you feel you do in your music that sets you apart from everyone else in the game. Be articulate. "I'm a good orchestrator" won't cut it, and neither will "My music is melodic". I got news for you: So is the music of about 800,000 others that work in film and TV. (Sorry to burst <i>that</i> little bubble!)<br />
<br />
Be honest, be real, and be clear.<br />
<br />
<i><b>What makes YOU different?</b></i><br />
<br />
Parcipation is simple too.<br />

But are <span style="font-style: italic;">creativity </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">creative process</span> one and the same?  Perhaps, by thinking carefully about this question, you&#8217;ll better equip yourself to diagnose and remedy the coughs and sputters of your own creative engine.  Let&#8217;s find out.<br /><br />As a commercially-oriented composer for media, I&#8217;d think of my creative process as the path I follow to transform my musical raw materials (inspiration, musical vocabulary, talent, experience, libraries, tools, and so on) into a ready-to-integrate, customized musical product (cue, score, song) meeting certain specifications (emotion, mood, style, timing) that center around my client&#8217;s desire to communicate a compelling message or story to an audience of media consumers.<br /><br />Curiously, the term <span style="font-style: italic;">creative process</span> is an oxymoron.  On the one hand, <span style="font-style: italic;">creative </span>connotes something new, original, unique, unexpected, spontaneous, impulsive, brilliant, inspired, daring, vital, ethereal, and divine &#8211; seemingly out of nowhere.  In contrast, <span style="font-style: italic;">process </span>suggests orderly technique, a deliberately-organized series of steps aimed at transforming one thing into another, repeatably, reliably, and efficiently.<br /><br />Thus, in creative process, it&#8217;s possible to distinguish two forces at work:  <span style="font-style: italic;">creativity</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">technique</span>.  They can be interpreted as contrary by nature, one spontaneous, the other predictable.  Yet, in creative process, they co-function in a synergistic, complementary manner.  Think <span style="font-style: italic;">yin </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">yang</span>.  Creativity provides the <span style="font-style: italic;">what</span>, technique provides the <span style="font-style: italic;">how </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">why</span>.  One can&#8217;t do very well without the other.  Creativity unbridled by technique leads to aimlessness:  the <span style="font-style: italic;">job </span>doesn&#8217;t get done.  Technique without creativity leads to uninspired, dull work.<br /><br />In its purest form, creativity is a sort of magic that somehow crystalizes meaningful <span style="font-style: italic;">ideas </span>from the murky mist, in which nothing in particular was previously distinguishable &#8211; perhaps like the coalescence of the planets, stars, and galaxies out of seemingly nothing at the dawn of the universe.  It is a blind god:  blissfully, capriciously, and enigmatically at play, unfettered by the limits of the concrete and the practical.  Its mantra is <span style="font-style: italic;">what if</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">what if</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">what if</span> &#8230; endlessly.<br /><br />It&#8217;s hard to get at creativity directly.  Ironically, it&#8217;s much easier to talk about <span style="font-style: italic;">techniques </span>that can be used to encourage creativity to occur and separate what&#8217;s useful from what isn&#8217;t.  Thus, for example, creation can often be stimulated by open-minded exploration and discovery in the realm of the unknown.  In effect you keep asking, <span style="font-style: italic;">what&#8217;s under that rock?</span>   Rather than seeking the familiar, you&#8217;re deliberately thinking about places you <span style="font-style: italic;">haven&#8217;t</span> looked before, committing yourself to look there, fearlessly.  Overturning each rock, you examine carefully and perhaps find a little world unto itself, home to wonders you&#8217;ve never before seen.  Studying it closely, you stumble upon something that inspires you as your mind follows a path not previously traversed.  Suddenly, something clicks.  Some connection is made, and something new bubbles to the surface of your thoughts.  <span style="font-style: italic;">That&#8217;s really cool</span>, you think.  Where could <span style="font-style: italic;">I</span> use <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span>?  And now you have in your hand an <span style="font-style: italic;">idea</span>, which appears, for practical purposes, to be the product of creativity.<br /><br />Notice that in explaining this view I haven&#8217;t described creativity itself, so much as <span style="font-style: italic;">attitude </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">systematically applied technique</span> that increase the probability that creativity will happen and that you&#8217;ll notice when it does.  Often, the <span style="font-style: italic;">spark </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">aha!</span> that we associate with creativity comes from such techniques of playful, enlightened, systematic exploration.<br /><br />In principle, exploring in the domain of musical possibilities is no different.  Just like the teaming microcosm under the rock, it&#8217;s full of dark, wet, ooky stuff &#8211; among which, now and then, an exciting gem waits to be found.  But you have to make yourself look.<br /><br />In his recent SCOREcast Online article, <a href="2009/11/list-film-composer-habits-for-any-list.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">A-List Film Composer Habits for Any-List Film Schedules</span></a>, Jai Megan reveals that composing film overtures, performing ethnomusicological research, and mining sound libraries are three exploratory techniques that can stimulate fast-track creativity while, at the same time, helping to separate worthy ideas from chaff.  On the other hand, other practices that Jai discusses, such as sticking to templates and maps, would be more correctly characterized as techniques on the <span style="font-style: italic;">process </span>side of the fence &#8211; in a way, helping to <span style="font-style: italic;">restrain </span>a potentially wandering composer from unwanted creative exploration when it can interfere with meeting schedules.<br /><br />I suspect that <span style="font-style: italic;">most </span>of creative process is actually technique, even the parts of it typically thought of as most creative.  If so, that&#8217;s fortunate, because technique can be taught and learned.  It&#8217;s much harder &#8211; maybe impossible &#8211; to teach creativity in the abstract.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Diagnosing Your Creative Process</span><br /><br />Maybe your creative engine is having trouble getting off the ground.  If so, any of the following illnesses may be keeping it down &#8211; and I&#8217;m sure you can come up with others.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not recognizing that creativity requires work. </span> Let&#8217;s face it.  You have to burn substantial calories to bring ideas to the surface, where you can put them to use.  Think of this problem in terms of the exploration technique I described earlier:  you have to turn over the rocks if you want to find the gems that may be lying underneath.  You might have to turn over a lot of them to find anything of value, and you have to think hard about where you&#8217;ve already looked and where you haven&#8217;t.  And, to stimulate the creative spark, you have to discipline your mind to <span style="font-style: italic;">think </span>about what&#8217;s interesting and different about what you&#8217;re seeing beneath each rock.  Disciplining your mind to follow a path it never before followed takes a lot more energy than letting it follow the same old well-worn paths.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Undermining yourself.</span>  Perhaps somewhere deep down inside, you suspect that if anyone sees <span style="font-style: italic;">your </span>ideas, they won&#8217;t stack up well against the ideas of your competitors.  You think you couldn&#8217;t bear this unfavorable comparison, so you avoid it by suppressing your own idea generation process.  You deliberately don&#8217;t turn over any rocks, because if you don&#8217;t try, you can&#8217;t fail.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Trying too hard to be someone else.</span>  You think your music has to have a certain sound (which might actually be true, in some cases &#8211; e.g., consider working for a film director who&#8217;s obsessively wedded to his temp music!).  So you reject too many of your own creative ideas.  Well, sometimes you may have to do that.  But if you do it too often, you&#8217;ll end up killing your own creativity.  You have to give sufficient voice to &#8230; you.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Needing a bigger vocabulary. </span>  This is like having too few rocks to turn over.  You need to work on expanding your arsenal of musical raw materials.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not knowing when to stop.</span>  You keep turning over rocks even after you&#8217;ve found enough good ideas and should be moving ahead with what you&#8217;ve got.  But you&#8217;re a perfectionist, and you think if you just turn over one more rock, you&#8217;ll find an even better idea.  So you never get on with grinding out the rest of your project.  Or, you may experience a seemingly endless gush of ideas that come at you so fast, you can&#8217;t capture one before another comes along to distract you.  In this case, you need to assert yourself as master of your own idea generation mill, and then you need to slow yourself down to the point where you can evaluate whether you already have what you need and are ready to move on.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fearing the ephemeral &#8220;perfect idea&#8221;. </span> You get what seems like a killer idea, but you don&#8217;t have it really nailed down yet.  It&#8217;s kind of vague and ephemeral.  So you freak out worrying that you won&#8217;t be able to keep it in your mind long enough to capture it in usable form.  Your excessive worry causes you to go blank, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy and losing the idea you were trying to keep.  Then you waste valuable time trying hard to get the idea to come back.   <span style="font-style: italic;">Get a life.</span></div>

Sometimes it's the way the music is mixed, such as when the sound <span style="font-style: italic;">should</span> be from a beat-up car radio, but instead is played straight without any coloration. However, more times than not it starts with the music itself. Either the performance is unconvincing or there's something amiss in the production that causes it to stick out. I used to think that it's just me<span style="font-style: italic;"> listening into</span> a show instead of just enjoying it like a casual viewer. And in some cases I still believe that's true. <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">But</span> - when I get a call from my parents after they've watched a newly released DVD, with them asking if the music was bad <span style="font-style: italic;">on purpose, </span>I realize that in many cases people still register a distracting cue even if it's not from an industry insider's perspective. The bottom line - if a source cue draws attention to itself, something's usually wrong. It's a tough balancing act - to know how much effort to put into a source cue, which in many cases is considered a throw-away. There's always a push to get through a vibe-alike as quickly as possible, but it needs to be "right". And if you're like me, you've spent a great deal of time and money on being able to convincingly reproduce a variety of styles. Between all of the tools that we use to make a cue sound more convincing - amp simulators, vintage drum samples, speaker enclosure impulse files, throw-back mic'ing and recording techniques - it can all be for naught if <span style="font-style: italic;">the vibe</span> isn't right.<br /><br />I ran into a classic example of this - almost by accident. It was during a workout - a treadmill run, to be precise - when it happened. I set my pace and had the mp3 player set to shuffle when the Eagles' "Hotel California" started about 10 minutes into the run. I noticed that my pace matched the tempo almost exactly - at least for the moment. Midway through the intro I had to make a slight adjustment and settled in again. Then another adjustment - and another. Eventually I gave up on trying to pace myself to the song. Usually when I hit a techno/trance/dance track that's close to my pace I can sync up and stay with it through the song. Anything that's sequenced or recorded to a click track is dead-simple to lock into. Not so this time. I must have listened to "Hotel California" hundreds of times throughout my life, and this was the <span style="font-style: italic;">first </span>time that I noticed the amount of push-pull in the piece.<br /><br />So I decided to map the tempo to see just how much slip and slide there is on the time line. I've done this before for orchestral mockups, since rubato and other subtle tempo changes are so important to making a convincing rendition. So I pulled the mp3 into Cubase and switched to "Time Warp" mode and started moving the bars to match up to the song. Sometimes it pays to map things down to the beat level, but in this case I was interested to see how the tempo was being pushed when comparing the verse to the chorus and whatnot, plus I wanted to get through it in time to finish this article.<br /><br />So here's a view of the tempo map. Click on it to see a larger version.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-qX4k73vO9I/SvnLn7zQqrI/AAAAAAAAAfs/4MgYt99laFU/s1600-h/Hotel_California_Tempo_Map.png"><img style="cursor: pointer; width: 520px; height: 138px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-qX4k73vO9I/SvnLn7zQqrI/AAAAAAAAAfs/4MgYt99laFU/s400/Hotel_California_Tempo_Map.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5402573114935650994" border="0" /></a><br /><br />The tempo map range was constrained to 72-77 bpm, so the "jumps" in tempo look more pronounced. That said, there's a lot of push-pull in there - at least more than I had originally perceived. If you look at the full-res image, you'll see a particular point on the tempo map (in the middle of the first chorus) that really jumps out. I highlighted it on the event list on the left edge of the screen shot - showing how the tempo goes from 73.4 to 75.7 bpm - more than a 3% jump. You'll see another one like it leading into the next verse, but it's not as pronounced. What's really interesting to me is that the <span style="font-style: italic;">second </span>pass through the chorus is very <span style="font-style: italic;">locked in</span>. And the verse on either side is pretty stable as well. However, on the beat level you'll hear the bass pushing things throughout, which is really prevalent in Verse 5 where there's no drum kit to hold things down. Mapping this out (to the bar level) took about 15 minutes, and I got a lot of mileage out of that exercise.<br /><br />When someone mentions "groove" I most often think of <span style="font-style: italic;">the pocket</span> - those little things going on <span style="font-style: italic;">inside the beat</span> the make a song feel one way or the other. And there's plenty of that happening in "Hotel California", but just looking at it from a bar-over-bar perspective you can see a so much of what gives this song its <span style="font-style: italic;">feel</span>. So if you ever get a call for a vibe-alike of an Eagles song, you may consider broadening out the tempo at the chorus (compared to the rest of the song) with a bit of a hurry-up at the turn in the fourth bar and back into the verse. And who knows - this may be a general tendency of classic rock. It would be interesting to see if anyone had made a study of this (for you college students looking for a grant/thesis subject, you're welcome).<br /><br />There are dozens of tools and gadgets to help the computer-based musician to humanize parts - many of which are built into the sequencing environment. In Cubase and Nuendo, there's not only Time Warp but also beat-specific Hitpoint Detection to extract a MIDI quantize map from a live groove you've recorded and apply it to virtual (and other audio) tracks. Most major sequencers have these kinds of features in one form or another. The key is to find those little windows of opportunity to dig in and discover what those tools can do for you, and use them to help take your tracks to the next level.<br /><br />At the end of the day it's about composing music that fits - and in many cases that means getting a lot of <span style="font-style: italic;">little </span>things right without spending a great deal of time in the minutia. This exercise may seem like a hassle for a relatively small benefit, but in many cases the subtleties are what make the difference between a library cue that gets passed over and one that gets placed in a show. Now it's time for you all to do some exploring on your own - and perhaps share a few tips and tricks for getting into the groove with the virtual tracks in your sequencing environment. Until then, you'll find me either in the studio or at the gym, trying my best to set a pace I can keep.<br /><br />________________<br /><span style="font-size:100%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">HOUSTON HAYNES</span></span><span style="font-size:100%;"> <span style="font-style: italic;">was born an raised in the southeastern United States, and moved to Los Angeles in 2003 to pursue a career as a composer</span><span style="font-style: italic;">. </span></span><span style="font-size:100%;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> You can find his SCORECast bio (and links to his other sites) <a href="2009/05/houston-haynes.html">here</a>.</span></span><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></div>

Most of the articles this month this will likely focus on various aspects of film or TV processes. But since DIY Studio focuses more on starting up, I&#8217;d like to broaden the scope of the definition, recognizing how diverse we may all be in where we are in our journeys. As such, this month&#8217;s DIY Studio edition is more about The CreativITY Process. The great thing about the Creative Process is that, at its most fundamental, it&#8217;s free.<br />
<br />
The Creative Process is a process- a method to get something done. It&#8217;s a thought process. There are of course tools, techniques, classes, theory, etc, to help you &#8220;be creative&#8221;, and many people take advantage of these. But doesn&#8217;t the very nature of creativity lie in people thinking in ways no one has before? For this edition of DIY Studio, let&#8217;s disregard all the workshops, classes, technical aspects, and maybe even theory. Let&#8217;s instead discuss the Creativity Process in terms of things everyone can do, even as we go about our day. I&#8217;ll tell you some things I do to get (or keep) my creativity flowing, and I hope to hear other thoughts from the SCOREcast community.<br />
<br />
<div><span style="font-size: 130%;"><b>Writing Without Writing</b></span><br />
For me, composing starts minutes or hours before I play my first note. It&#8217;s tempting to just dive into my studio when I get a new, load up some patches, and start playing. And sometimes I do that, as you&#8217;ll see below. But sometimes I just find a silent place and listen to the music in my head. Back in the 80&#8217;s I used to love this painting show on PBS, with Bill Alexander. He always painted such awesome landscapes. One of the most fascinating things about watching this show is that before he even touched his brush to the canvas, he would fully describe the painting as he imagined it. He had the scene fixed in his head before he even began; the act of painting was just a matter of attempting to replicate in the physical world, the image in his head. I often do this when I write- I just sit and listen to the concert in my head. Once I&#8217;ve listened to it and I have it firmly fixed in my mind, it&#8217;s then just a matter of &#8220;copying&#8221; it into the physical world. To use a film term I&#8217;ll call this technique &#8220;previsualization&#8221;.<br />
</div><div></div><br />
<div>Jai Meghan discussed in an article earlier this month the technique of writing an Overture. For me, the mental technique of previsualizing dovetails perfectly into the Overture concept. Using previsualization and Overtures in tandem lets you almost &#8220;cookbook&#8221; the cues from that point on, giving you the opportunity to be creative when you&#8217;re at your best, instead of trying to come up with an effective and memorable cue in the middle of the night when you&#8217;ve been working for 16 hours.<br />
</div><br />
<div><span style="font-size: 130%;"><b>When Inspiration Attacks!</b></span><br />
Besides those times when you&#8217;re sitting at your computer, piano, or other instrument, what do you do to be ready for inspiration to strike? I&#8217;m very curious to hear from you about this! For me, I have a few standbys.First, I carry around staff paper. I have some in my backpack with my &#8220;day job&#8221; stuff, or sometimes I keep a few sheet in the car. If I get caught without any staff paper, I hit <a href="http://www.blanksheetmusic.net/">http://www.blanksheetmusic.net/</a> and print off a sheet or two. More than a couple times this web site meant the difference between my capturing a motif or passage, and letting it get away. Alternatively (or additionally), I&#8217;ve also recorded myself, actually singing melodies to capture them. If you have a phone or PDA, I recommend you get familiar with your voice recorder. Some of my best ideas occurred to me in traffic, on the drive to and from work.Next, I always have a project. If it&#8217;s not a paying gig or something for anyone in particular, I make up projects for myself. This forces me to continue honing my writing, orchestrating, and technical skills, but it also gives me an opportunity to practice writing in different styles and develops my portfolio, without pressure. As a composer still getting my feet wet, I do have plenty of non-project time; this is a great way to keep myself sharp.One of my favorite creativity activities is to just sit down, open my DAW, hit record, and just play. I turn off the metronome, I don&#8217;t worry about key sig, playing well, tempo, anything. I just play. Go for at least 10 minutes, just messing around. From this method, I&#8217;ve come up with jazz pieces, classical pieces, I&#8217;ve discovered new chords / chord progressions, and one cartoony piece my daughter loves. I keep all of these performances in a special directory I call a &#8220;sketchbook&#8221;. Just as artists and writers keep little sketchbooks with them to scribble ideas, so should composers. It&#8217;s amazing the inspiration you can give yourself by pulling up your sketchbook when you have writer&#8217;s block.<br />
<br />
I have a few more thoughts on creativity, maybe I&#8217;ll continue in the comments, but I think I&#8217;ll wrap up for now and just let the discussion begin. What is your CreativITY Process?<br />

<br />
There were a lot of valued comments from the SCOREcast readership gauging the various reasons why the mechanics of filmmaking requires the assistance of music. As promised (albeit a bit later than I hoped), I'd like to finally weigh in myself on this elusive answer.<br />
<br />
Film is a terribly awkward medium. If you've ever tried to materialize images from your head onto the screen in a cohesive manner suitable enough to tell a story, you understand the obstacles inherent to the craft. The most glaring complication facing this cumbersome art form is the very fact that each and every one of us (members of the audience) are different. We lead vastly varying lives influenced by disparaging backgrounds and previous experiences. We are free thinkers and unabashed emotional beings triggered by an unlimited barrage of unique variables. <br />
<br />
How then does one person elicit a very specific and prescribed reaction required in order to properly ingest the whole narrative experience through moving pictures?<br />
<br />
If you were to show one hundred randomly selected people in a room this photograph&#8230;<br />
<br />
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_6sJwCvpA_rI/SvMClSLrRRI/AAAAAAAAADQ/h_FE3KMc-WY/s1600-h/SafetyLast1TN.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5400663217706583314" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_6sJwCvpA_rI/SvMClSLrRRI/AAAAAAAAADQ/h_FE3KMc-WY/s400/SafetyLast1TN.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 296px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 400px;" /></a><br />
<center>SAFETY LAST (1923)</center><br />
What would the audience's reaction be? Some would fear for this man's life. Some might laugh or chuckle. Others could quite possibly be thinking of what they have to get at the grocery store on the way home. Some will be in a great mood because their boss gave them a raise earlier in the day while others will look upon it in a foul mood seeking solace or refuge. Because every one of the amassed audience members are unique, so to will be their reaction. <br />
<br />
The question then becomes, how do you want your audience to react? How can you facilitate this reaction? How can you corral as many of these one hundred audience members all hailing from different backgrounds, different moods, and exhibiting different tastes, into communing with a shared singular experience? It is this meticulous control of human reaction that is the paramount obstacle in filmmaking. Otherwise you relegate your audience to mere observation of the images and this is wholly unacceptable. We don't go to movies to observe a story. We go to the movies to experience a story. <br />
<br />
In still art forms such as photography, painting, illustration, or sculpture it is quintessentially acceptable to rely solely on observation. One image is not reliant upon another to properly traverse a narrative timeline. In film, however, ones reaction to a particular image or line of dialogue is wholly dependent upon what preceded it and what is to follow.<br />
<br />
Music is the ingredient which transcends our relationship with the images from mere observation to that of a wholly digested narrative experience.</div>

<br />
<i>"There are two parts to creating. One is exploring and the other is culling. If you confuse them, then you won't get anywhere. Mick Goodrick once said to me, 'When you swim, there is stroking and then there's gliding. And if you only stroke you won't be able to swim, because you won't get anywhere. You need to be able to glide in between strokes.' There's a period of time when you are capturing the things floating around through you, and you have to be very careful not to be judgmental at that point. There is also the point when you need to be critical and throw things out, but if you go there at the wrong point in the process you'll simply muck it up."</i><br />
<br />
Here is a great video of Mirowitz talking to the New Mexico Film Commission last year. This is an amazing presentation about the conversation and process between the director and composer and how they wind up co-creating a cohesive film score. An extremely enlightening presentation, this video could be a masterclass in the director/composer relationship.<br />
The entire series is about 90 minutes long, so when you have time, check it out.<br />

It's a tough thing to talk about for me because my creative process (CP) is in such a constant state of flux all of the time. From project to project, my CP changes up drastically. And then sometimes, what worked on one project also works great on the next.<br />
<br />
What I will offer today is a sneak peek into the creative habits of some of the composers that I've worked with over the few years that I've been assisting. From these great composers, I've gleaned many secrets, tricks, templates, skills, and techniques - some that I use in my own work, and others that I don't, but might someday. The thing that I've always noticed about each composer though, no matter who they were or what they were working on, is that these tricks and secrets were really "habitual" in their work flows. These are things that they do EVERY time they sit down to conceptualize or write through a film score. And I believe that is the key to the whole thing. You need to develop "habits" that will invite the Muse to the right time and place for a creative collision.<br />
<br />
Since these are from different composers, I will present some here in no particular order. Hopefully, you'll find one or two of these habits (or all of them if you are just getting going) useful.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Overture Blueprint</span><br />
Several composers I've worked for use this principle as an overarching guide to how they score a film. They'll watch the film many times (and I mean MANY times; sometimes in upwards of thirty of forty viewings), and then they'll sit down at the piano or guitar and write an "overture".<br />
<br />
In traditional terms, an overture is a piece of music that "comes before" or "precedes" something else. A typical example would be the music the symphony plays before the opera starts. But inherent in almost every overture are the main themes of the opera or of the piece that follows the overture. The overture is sort of a large format rendering of every main theme within the whole work and addresses each theme with as much fullness and bravado that can be pulled from it - a fully fleshed out thematic linear string. Each theme and motif is represented in the overture. Upon completing the overture, the composer then has a veritable blueprint from which he or she can create the score and work the cues around in order to not stray far from the original thoughts behind the music.<br />
<br />
Many composers use or have used this method, from <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000025/" rel="imdb" title="Jerry Goldsmith">Jerry Goldsmith</a> to <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0653211/" rel="imdb" title="John Ottman">John Ottman</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Research and Ethnomusicology</span><br />
When I was at Media Ventures, I watched Hans and crew research the hell out of most films they were charged with scoring. In fact, much of the first weeks were consumed with me and my fellow interns fetching books and Web clippings about certain instruments, even to the point of sussing out the foremost experts in the fields of these instruments and asking them questions, or sometimes inviting them to play on scores. These exercises in research gave me an awareness of the breadth of our musical vocabulary that I never learned in school or in private study. Once you really dive into the process of researching, from an ethnomusicological standpoint, you will understand just how much you have to learn about global musics. Talking to those who play these instruments will also teach you how to better write for that sound, and as a composer who most likely doesn't play that particular instrument, this is vital to the quality of your music.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Templates and Maps</span><br />
One of the things I never can stomach in certain scores is when you are watching along and are really into the film, and then POW! Out of nowhere, a sound so AGAINST anything else in the film score whomps you upside your head, taking you out of the film completely. More often that not, you hear this on smaller, lower-budget films. And I'll tell you why.<br />
<br />
Not always, but typically, the lower the budget the less experienced the composer and director. The above problem is usually two-fold. First, the director let that choice go unchallenged, or in some cases came up with the idea himself! Secondly, the composer was working without a "template".<br />
<br />
A template can be defined here as a "DAW instrumentation map for the duration of a film score". Essentially, you take your arrange window in your DAW and load up every articulation of every instrument that you deem necessary for the film's score... and you DON'T DEVIATE from that template as you write your cues. This way, the entire score, from beginning to end, is cohesive and complimentary of its parts.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned before, nine times out of ten, this is a rookie mistake. Most seasoned pros have already learned from the consequences of this error. When a score travels outside the lines of its own conceptualization, it causes severe cinematic problems. Take some time and be thorough in setting up your templates. If you practice the method of the "Overture Blueprint", as outlined above, you might already have the makings of your full template by the time you are finished with the overture.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Sound Mining, the "Favorite Bank", and Go-To Sounds</span><br />
If I had a nickel for every time I've seen composers sit at their desk and scroll through plugin presets with one hand while eating a carton of Chinese food with the other, I'd be a very rich man. The best composers I've worked with are those who know their rigs inside and out, and the only way to know what you have sitting on those precious drives is to "mine for sounds" as much as possible. One of my duties as an assistant has been to set up a "favorite bank" for my composer so that when he or she finds a killer sound that catches the ear, we can throw it into the bank and recall it later when we are looking for something interesting in a particular situation.<br />
<br />
Time is precious. There is often no time on a film score schedule to sit and try to "find" the right synth patch or MIDI drum sound. You have to have it at your fingertips, or your creative flow will eventually slow to a stop. Make sure to have all of your "favorite" sounds readily accessible so that you can recall them at will when you need them the most.<br />
<br />
This also goes for "go-to sounds" &#8212; those sounds that you use all of the time. These may already be in your template, but if they aren't, you should have them in their own sampler bank so that you can get at them instantly. These days, with Kontakt 4 and Machfive being as powerful as they have become, you can pull virtually any sound into your sampler in most formats. There is no reason to not have everything loaded into your sampler in a "favorite bank" or "go-to bank". Just do it. Trust me.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
As elementary as some of these things might seem, they are the habits of some of the best composers working today, and those composers are adamant that these habits be as easy to maintain as possible.<br />
<br />

Log into the COMMENTS below and tell me what you think your Top 3 best habits are in the conceptualization phase of scoring a film. Tell me why these habits work in your particular case and why you think they are most important to you.</span><br />
