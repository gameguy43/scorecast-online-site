					<description><![CDATA[Hey guys,

Very interesting podcast - I work as Sync &#038; Marketing manager for Cutting Edge Group. It&#039;s interesting your insight onto whether inflating the music budget affects the choice of composer - in individual cases I can&#039;t comment, but generally it would be a measure of protecting your investment. Ultimately and as you do say, it&#039;s a creative choice on the director&#039;s side - but I&#039;d say it went very well for us in the event of &#039;The King&#039;s Speech&#039; - given the number of awards it has swept up, and the phenomenal success of the film as a complete package. 
Also, stating the obvious, Desplat is a French composer - so this should go some way to showing the choice for the right composer, rather than a specific bias for UK/US/any nationality.

I&#039;ll follow your podcasts closely, and thanks for the insight.

[comments are my own opinion, and not those of Cutting Edge Group]

best,

					<description><![CDATA[Great show once again. I loved that advice about getting in with the crowd of tomorrow as opposed to trying to push oneself into the crowd of today, and the mention that most of Christopher&#039;s gigs have essentially grown out of the ripple effect from a small group of contacts/colleagues he formed early in his career.

Besides actually having a good creative head on your shoulders the one thing that seems to be the determining factor to success or failure in this business is simply perseverance. You can&#039;t win the prize if you drop out of the race.]]></description>
