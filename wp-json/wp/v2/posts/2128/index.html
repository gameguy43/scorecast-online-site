An entire library based around the concept of reversing stuff? <em>Gimmicky, one trick pony and probably redundant anyway<\/em>, I mumbled to myself. It&#8217;s not hard to reverse stuff, and you only need it for a few odd bits of effects anyway. Just a bit of PR spin and some flashy graphic design, I thought. Sheesh.<\/p>\n<p>And then I played it.<\/p>\n<p>What an extraordinary library it has turned out to be, from a brand new developer who instantly acquires respect and admiration. This is a library that has arrived from apparently nowhere, fully formed, is highly useful and also beautifully produced and engineered. I can barely level a criticism at it, in fact, and far from it being good only for occasional effects, it&#8217;s somehow managed to make itself very broad and genuinely useful on a day to day basis. The real question is \u2013 how did they make it so good from such an unpromising concept?<\/p>\n<h2>ENGINE<\/h2>\n<p>REV is a Kontakt Player library and it requires 5.3 to run (the library won&#8217;t work on 5.2.x). Download and installation is via Continuata \u2013 I&#8217;ve had more than my fair share of problems with Continuata in the past, but it downloaded the 6.5gb library hitch-free. Not the fastest on the block, but no slouch either.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2130\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/REV-Timed_Instruments_02.png\" alt=\"REV-Timed_Instruments_02\" width=\"632\" height=\"416\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/REV-Timed_Instruments_02.png 632w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/REV-Timed_Instruments_02-389x256.png 389w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>PATCHES<\/h2>\n<p>The first thing that strikes you is the apparent lack of patches \u2013 <em>four<\/em>, to be precise. But as their names suggest, this is very much the tip of the iceberg, since each nki is actually a core container for literally hundreds of different patches. There are Instruments, Loops, Rises and Timed Instruments (a variation on basic Instruments where samples are loaded into RAM for smooth time-stretching).<\/p>\n<p>Starting with Instruments, the first place to go is the instrument browser, which has subfolders for Fundamentals, Simple and Complex Pads, Pulses, Swells, Plucked, ReTron, Simple (basic reverses), Sling, Sound Design, Stutter One Shots, Aggressive, Percussive and User Presets. Each of these contain dozens of patches, so you quickly realize that this is a vast library indeed.<\/p>\n<p>Things start off much as you might expect \u2013 some cool, very well executed reverse patches that evoke modern soundtracks like Breaking Bad or quality documentaries (er, not the Discovery Channel kind!). Then quickly you realize that the reversed angle can be very subtle, even not really noticeable in many cases. There&#8217;s an organic quality to a lot of the sounds, which is very pleasing \u2013 it has one foot in the land of the real, and it rarely sounds electronic (except for the pulses, which are deliberately not organic). The simple pads are instantly playable\u00a0 and mostly based around real instruments (piano, guitars, cello, clarinet etc). They typically evoke the instrument that they are derived from, but its staggering how far the basic reverse concept appears to take things. Often it sounds more frozen than reversed \u2013 there&#8217;s plenty of patches without that distinctive sharp reversed end. And yet they always sound lifelike, with movement that makes it sound real if slightly other-worldly. The ReTron section takes it further, with a sharp attack and no release, while the slings play tricks such as starting forwards and then reversing at the mid-point.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2131\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/REV-Rises_01.png\" alt=\"REV-Rises_01\" width=\"632\" height=\"416\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/REV-Rises_01.png 632w, http:\/\/www.scorecastonline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/REV-Rises_01-389x256.png 389w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>USER INTERFACE<\/h2>\n<p>With any patch loaded, you&#8217;ll now be able to manipulate it using the excellent and intuitive interface. There are on\/off switches for lo-fi, rage (distortion), stack (amp sim), filter, delay, reverb and EQ, and clicking on the names gives you access to the controls. The instrument patches are made up of two layers, each with stutter (volume and pitch) sections, the overall filter and envelope ADSR along with layer volume, pitch and pan, while loops and rises have just the one layer (with the same controls). It&#8217;s staggeringly easy to just dive and and tweak a sound beyond all recognition \u2013 the controls are all well chosen.<\/p>\n<h2>LOOPS AND RISERS<\/h2>\n<p>Reversed sounds and riser effects typically arrive with a bunch of problems that get slapped in your lap. If you&#8217;re playing a chord with that classic reversed end of note, the tails will typically end at different times for each note, resulting in an ugly mess which destroys the effect. Not so here \u2013 the library has been painstakingly designed to eliminate this nastiness completely \u2013 all the notes time themselves to end at the right point. And as for rises, which might be hit and miss to get to end at a hit point, the best solution until now is to find the source WAV and plonk it onto the timeline, lining it up by eye. This isn&#8217;t possible here, as the samples are contained in locked monoliths, but they go one better: You can chose how many bars you want your riser to stretch across, with or without a tail. Brilliant \u2013 no more endless juggling around the piano roll making your riser time correctly. Also useful, there&#8217;s also half\/double-speed options for the loops and risers.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of loops and risers, these sections are every bit as versatile as the instruments. The same acoustic instrument-based stuff is there and complemented with high, mid and low pulses, percussion, cymbals, shakers etc. In all of these, the keyboard is split, with the lower part controlling pitch and the upper 2 octave&#8217;s worth of variations which can be performed, combined and layered.<\/p>\n<p>Kudos to Output for\u00a0 knocking their debut release way, way out of the park. Admittedly I&#8217;ve only scratched the surface of the huge treasure trove it contains, but honestly there&#8217;s nothing I can find fault with. Nothing. The library is vast, top quality, diverse, inspiring, usable and tweakable. Often you find yourself waiting for a 1.1 of the library to get the gremlins ironed out or expand on the range of options \u2013 in this case I find myself realizing that 1.0 just works brilliantly and instead I take to wondering how on earth they can top it for whatever they library release next.<\/p>\n<p><strong>REV<\/strong> by <a title=\"Output\" href=\"http:\/\/outputsounds.com\" target=\"_blank\">Output<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>$199<\/strong> MFR (launch price)<br \/>\nPowered by <strong>Native Instruments Kontakt\/Kontakt Player<br \/>\n<\/strong>Purchase <strong>REV<\/strong> or watch videos demos and walkthroughs at <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/outputsounds.com\" target=\"_blank\">outputsounds.com<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A library in reverse?
